They live a life of poverty as Selma works at a factory with her good friend Kathy, whom she nicknames Cvalda. She rents a trailer home on the property of town policeman Bill Houston and his wife Linda. She is also pursued by the shy but persistent Jeff who also works at the factory. What no one in Selma's life knows is that she has a hereditary degenerative disease which is gradually causing her to go blind. She has been saving up every penny that she makes  to pay for an operation which will prevent her young son from suffering the same fate. To escape the misery of her daily life Selma accompanies Cvalda to the local cinema where together they watch fabulous Hollywood musicals . In her day-to-day life, when things are too boring or upsetting, Selma slips into daydreams or perhaps a trance-like state where she imagines the ordinary circumstances and individuals around her have erupted into elaborate musical theater numbers. These songs, as do many of Björk's songs, use some sort of real-life noise  as an underlying rhythm. Unfortunately, Selma slips into one such trance while working at the factory. Soon Jeff and Cvalda begin to realize that Selma can barely see at all. Additionally, Bill reveals to Selma that his materialistic wife Linda spends more than his salary, there is no money left from his inheritance, and he is behind in payments and the bank is going to take his house. He asks Selma for a loan, but she declines. He regrets telling Selma his secret. To comfort Bill, Selma reveals her secret blindness, hoping that together they can keep each other's secret. Bill then hides in the corner of Selma's home, knowing she can't see him, and watches as she puts some money in her kitchen tin. The next day, after having broken her machine the night before through careless error, Selma is fired from her job. When she comes home to put her final wages away she finds the tin is empty; she goes next door to report the theft to Bill and Linda only to hear Linda discussing how Bill has brought home their safe deposit box to count their savings. Linda additionally reveals that Bill has ""confessed"" his affair with Selma, and that Selma must move out immediately. Knowing that Bill was broke and that the money he is counting must be hers, she confronts him and attempts to take the money back. He draws a gun on her, and in a struggle he is wounded. Linda discovers the two of them and, assuming that Selma is attempting to steal the money, runs off to tell the police at Bill's command. Bill then begs Selma to take his life, telling her that this will be the only way she will ever reclaim the money that he stole from her. Selma shoots at him several times, but due to her blindness manages to only maim Bill further. In the end, she performs a coup de grâce with the safe deposit box. In one of the scenes, Selma slips into a trance and imagines that Bill's corpse stands up and slow dances with her, urging her to run to freedom. She does, and takes the money to the Institute for the Blind to pay for her son's operation before the police can take it from her. Selma is caught and eventually put on trial. It is here that she is pegged as a Communist sympathizer and murderess. Although she tells as much truth about the situation as she can, she refuses to reveal Bill's secret, saying that she had promised not to. Additionally, when her claim that the reason she didn't have any money was because she had been sending it to her father in Czechoslovakia is proven false, she is convicted and given the death penalty. Cvalda and Jeff eventually put the pieces of the puzzle together and get back Selma's money, using it instead to pay for a trial lawyer who can free her. Selma becomes furious and refuses the lawyer, opting to face the death penalty rather than let her son go blind, but she is deeply distraught as she awaits her death. Although a sympathetic female prison guard named Brenda tries to comfort her, the other state officials show no feelings and are eager to see her executed. Brenda encourages Selma to walk. On her way to the gallows, Selma goes to hug the other men on death row while singing to them. However, on the gallows, she becomes terrified, so that she must be strapped to a collapse board. Her hysteria when the hood is placed over her face delays the execution. Selma begins crying hysterically and Brenda cries with her, but Cvalda rushes to inform her that the operation was successful and that Gene will see. Relieved, Selma sings the final song on the gallows with no musical accompaniment, although she is hanged before she finishes. A curtain is then drawn in front of her body, while the missing part of the song shows on the screen: ""They say it's the last song/They don't know us, you see/It's only the last song/If we let it be.""individual dancing robbery factory worker secret small town blindness and impaired vision immigrant eye operation naivety hereditary disease dying and death debt police officer",True,tt0168629,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,40031879,0,0,2.127490546875,-1.1627692044360227,,,243609.5,7493609.5,,,,0,,,-6000000.0,23.0,1000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,53611975.0,4.0,60611975.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,615787.0,1615787.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,435023.0,2181987.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,30805987.5,23805987.5,3.375,1.0,76394553.2193505

A tribe of herbivorous early hominids is foraging for food in the African desert. A leopard kills one member, and another tribe of man-apes drives them from their water hole. Defeated, they sleep overnight in a small exposed rock crater, and awake to find a black monolith has appeared in front of them. They approach it shrieking and jumping, and eventually touch it cautiously. Soon after, one of the man-apes ([[Daniel Richter  realizes how to use a bone as both a tool and a weapon, which they start using to kill prey for their food. Growing increasingly capable and assertive, they reclaim control of the water hole from the other tribe by killing its leader. Triumphant, the tribe's leader throws his weapon-tool into the air as the scene shifts  from the falling bone to an orbital satellite millions of years in the future.Giulio Angioni, Fare, dire, sentire: l'identico e il diverso nelle culture , p. 37 and Un film del cuore, in Il dito alzato , pp. 121-136Commentators on the film generally assume this is a gap of millions, not thousands, of years. See {{cite book}} and {{cite book}} The novel gives the age of the monolith on the Moon as three million years  while the film dialogue and an early draft of the screenplay gives it as four million  A Pan Am space plane carries Dr. Heywood R. Floyd  to a space station orbiting Earth for a layover on his trip to Clavius Base, a US outpost on the Moon. After making a videophone call from the station to his daughter , he encounters his friend Elena , a Russian scientist, and her colleague Dr. Smyslov , who ask Floyd about ""odd things"" occurring at Clavius, and the rumor of a mysterious epidemic at the base. Floyd politely but firmly declines to answer any questions about the epidemic, claiming he is ""not at liberty to discuss this"". At Clavius, Floyd heads a meeting of base personnel, apologizing for the epidemic cover story but stressing secrecy. His mission is to investigate a recently found artifact—""Tycho Magnetic Anomaly One"" —""deliberately buried"" four million years ago. Floyd and others ride in a Moonbus to the artifact, a black monolith identical to the one encountered by the apes. The visitors examine the monolith, and pose for a photo in front of it. While doing so, they hear a very loud high-pitched radio signal emanating from within the monolith.  Eighteen months later, the American spaceship Discovery One is bound for Jupiter. On board are mission pilots and scientists Dr. David Bowman  and Dr. Frank Poole , and three other scientists who are in cryogenic hibernation. Most of Discovery's operations are controlled by the ship's computer, HAL 9000 , or simply ""Hal"", as the crew call it. While Bowman and Poole watch Hal and themselves being interviewed in a BBC show about the mission, the computer states that he is ""foolproof and incapable of error."" Hal also speaks of its enthusiasm for the mission, and how he enjoys working with humans. When asked by the host if Hal has genuine emotions, Bowman replies that he appears to, but that the truth is unknown. Hal asks Bowman about the unusual mystery and secrecy surrounding the mission, but then interrupts himself to report the imminent failure of a device which controls the ship's main antenna. After retrieving the component with an EVA pod, the astronauts cannot find anything wrong with it. Hal suggests reinstalling the part and letting it fail so the problem can be found. Mission control concurs, but advises the astronauts that results from their twin Hal 9000 indicate the ship's Hal is in error predicting the fault. When queried, Hal insists that the problem, like all previous issues with the HAL series, is due to ""human error"". Concerned about Hal's behavior, Bowman and Poole enter one of the EVA pods to talk without the computer overhearing them. They both have suspicions about Hal, despite the perfect reliability of the HAL series, but they decide to follow its suggestion to replace the unit. As the astronauts agree to disconnect Hal if it is proven to be wrong, they are unaware that Hal is reading their lips through the pod's window. While Poole is attempting to replace the unit during a spacewalk, his EVA pod, controlled by Hal, severs his oxygen hose and sets him adrift. Bowman, not realizing the computer is responsible for this, takes another pod to attempt a rescue, leaving his helmet behind. While he is gone, Hal turns off the life-support functions of the crewmen in suspended animation. When Bowman returns to the ship with Poole's body, Hal refuses to let him in, stating that the astronaut's plan to deactivate him jeopardizes the mission. Bowman manually opens the ship's emergency airlock and bodily enters the ship risking death from exposure to a vacuum. After donning a helmet, Bowman proceeds to Hal's processor core intent on disconnecting most of the functions of the computer. Hal first tries to reassure Dave, then pleads with him to stop, and finally begins to express fear—all in a steady monotone voice. Dave ignores him and disconnects each of the computer's processor modules. Hal eventually regresses to his earliest programmed memory, the song ""Daisy Bell"", which he sings for Bowman. When the computer is finally disconnected, a prerecorded video message from Floyd plays. In it, he reveals the existence of the four million-year-old black monolith on the Moon, ""its origin and purpose still a total mystery"". Floyd adds that it has remained completely inert, except for a single, very powerful radio emission aimed at Jupiter.  At Jupiter, Bowman leaves Discovery One in an EVA pod and finds another monolith in orbit around the planet. Approaching it, the pod is suddenly pulled into a tunnel of colored light,Kubrick, in a 1970 interview with Joseph Gelmis, refers to this as a ""Star-Gate""(Gelmis and a disoriented and terrified Bowman finds himself racing at great speed across vast distances of space, viewing bizarre cosmological phenomena and strange alien landscapes of unusual colors. He finds himself, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, standing in a bedroom appointed in the Louis XVI-style. Bowman sees progressively older versions of himself, his point of view switching each time, alternately appearing formally dressed and eating dinner, and finally as a very elderly man lying in a bed. A black monolith appears at the foot of the bed, and as Bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a fetus-like being enclosed in a transparent orb of light.Kubrick, in a 1970 interview with Joseph Gelmis, refers to this as a ""Star-Child""(Gelmis The new being floats in space beside the Earth, gazing at it.moon jupiter artificial intelligence man vs machine technology super computer space travel space mission moon base astronaut cult film evolution monolith space station space opera 2000s",False,tt0062622,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,68700000,1,0,4.725,17.51149136225447,,,35254340.75,40139840.75,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7445136.0,9345136.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,7640272.0,9440272.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,24774136.0,27174136.0,2.0,,,,7445136.0,9345136.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,63643507.60930695

One day he is assigned the task of trying to rectify an error caused by a fly getting jammed in a printer, which caused it to misprint a file, resulting in the incarceration and death during interrogation of Mr. Archibald Buttle instead of the suspected ""terrorist"", Archibald Tuttle. When Sam visits Buttle's widow, he discovers Jill Layton , the upstairs neighbour of the Buttles, and is astonished to see that she has the face of the woman from his recurring dreams. Jill is trying to help Mrs. Buttle find out what happened to her husband, but has become sick of dealing with the bureaucracy. Unbeknownst to her, she is now considered a terrorist friend of Tuttle for attempting to report the mistake of Buttle's arrest in Tuttle's place to a bureaucracy that would not admit such an error. When Sam tries to approach her, she is very cautious and avoids giving Sam full details, worried the government will track her down. During this time, Sam comes in contact with the real Tuttle , a renegade air conditioning specialist who once worked for the government but left due to his dislike of paperwork. Tuttle helps Sam deal with two Central Services workers, Spoor  and Dowser , who later return to demolish Sam's ducts and seize his apartment under the guise of fixing the air conditioning. Sam discovers that the only way to learn about Jill is to get transferred to Information Retrieval, where he would have access to her classified records. He requests the help of his mother, Ida , vainly addicted to rejuvenating plastic surgery under the care of cosmetic surgeon Dr. Jaffe , as she has connections to high-ranking officers and is able to help her son get the position. Delighted that her son has finally shown ambition &ndash; having previously turned down similar offers from her &ndash; Ida arranges for Sam's promotion. Sam eventually obtains Jill's records and tracks her down before she is arrested, then falsifies her records to make her appear deceased, allowing her to escape the bureaucracy. The two share a romantic night together, but they are quickly apprehended by the government at gunpoint. Charged with treason for abusing his newly acquired position, Sam is restrained to a chair in a large, empty cylindrical room , to be tortured by his old ""friend"", Jack Lint , who is wearing a mask seen earlier in Sam's dreams and had previously renounced their friendship in favour of loyalty to the Ministry. Sam also learns that Jill had been killed resisting arrest. However, before Jack manages to begin the torture, Tuttle and other members of the resistance break into the Ministry. The resistance shoots Jack, rescues Sam, and blows up the Ministry building as they flee. Sam and Tuttle run off together, but Tuttle disappears amid a mass of scraps of paper from the destroyed Ministry. Sam runs to his mother attending a funeral for a friend who died of excessive cosmetic surgery. Finding his mother now looking like Jill and fawned over by a flock of juvenile admirers, Sam falls into the open casket, falling through an empty black void. He lands in a world from his daydreams, and attempts escape up a pile of flex-ducts from the police and imaginary monsters. He finds a door at the top of the pile and, passing through it, is surprised to find himself in a trailer driven by Jill. The two drive away from the city together. However, this ""happy ending"" is all a product of Sam's delusions: Sam is still strapped to the chair and observed by Jack and Deputy Minister Mr. Helpmann , who is portrayed along the film as a good ""friend"" of Sam's family. Realising that Sam has grown catatonic, with a smile on his face and humming ""Brazil"", the two declare Sam a lost cause, and exit the room as the film ends.bureaucracy police state terror great britain dream dystopia government satire dark comedy cult film anarchic comedy",False,tt0088846,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,9932146,0,0,-0.5102476342977641,0.8905496399261349,,,,,,,,0,,,35000000.0,7.0,50000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,36354057.2,9.0,43054057.2,5.0,10244207.0,3.0,22244207.0,1.0,6860354.333333333,14.0,8360354.333333333,3.0,,0.0,,,6860354.333333333,14.0,8360354.333333333,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20997264.5,23697264.5,2.0,,,,37365581.0,42365581.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,26705348.0,31205348.0,2.0,37365581.0,42365581.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,16045115.0,20045115.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14556319.8,23296319.8,5.0,,,26403794.573333334,19063794.573333334,5.875,2.6,51342232.19105865

Billy lives with his widowed father, Jackie ([[Gary Lewis , and older brother, Tony , both coal miners out on strike, and also his invalid Nan , who once aspired to be a professional dancer in Durham. Jackie takes Billy to the Sports Centre to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens upon a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio in the Sports Centre is temporarily being used as a soup kitchen for the striking miners. Unknown to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet. But, passionate about dancing, Billy secretly continues lessons with his dance teacher Sandra Wilkinson's  help. Mrs. Wilkinson believes Billy is talented enough to study at the Royal Ballet School in London, but due to Tony's arrest during a skirmish between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Mrs. Wilkinson tells Jackie about the missed opportunity, but fearing that Billy will be considered a ""poof"", both Jackie and Tony are outraged at the prospect of Billy becoming a professional ballet dancer. Over Christmas, Billy learns his best friend, Michael is gay. Although Billy is not, he is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie catches Billy dancing in the gym and realises his son is truly gifted; he will do whatever it takes to help Billy attain his dream. Jackie attempts to cross the picket line to pay for the trip to London, but Tony blocks him. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money,and Jackie sells Billy's mum's jewelry to cover the cost and Jackie takes him to London to audition for the Royal Ballet School. Though highly nervous, Billy performs well, but he punches another boy in his frustration at the audition and the fear that he has ruined his chance of attaining his dream. He is sternly rebuked by the review board. Seemingly rejected, Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, he receives a letter accepting him to the Royal Ballet School, and he leaves home to attend. The film's final scene is set fourteen years later : the mature Billy (dancer/actor [[Adam Cooper  takes the stage to perform the lead in Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake, as Jackie, Tony, and Michael watch in the audience.workers' quarter dancing class strike northern england scholarship ballet single father audition ballet school dance teacher 1980s miners strike durham england father son relationship",False,tt0249462,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,109280263,0,0,20.8560526,-1.1627692044360227,,,4335572.666666667,13668906.0,233212670.0,251212670.0,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,264317794.0,289317794.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-3600207.0,399793.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,52000000.0,58000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,18445540.0,22345540.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,76394553.2193505

Deckard, whose job as a ""Blade Runner"" was to track down bioengineered beings known as replicants and ""retire""  them, is told by Bryant that several have escaped and come to Earth illegally. As Tyrell Corporation Nexus-6 models, they have only a four-year lifespan, and may have come to Earth to try to extend their lives. Deckard watches a video of another Blade Runner named Holden  administering a ""Voight-Kampff"" test designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their empathic response to questions. The subject of the test, Leon , shoots Holden. Bryant wants Deckard to return to work to retire Leon and three other replicants—Roy Batty , Zhora  and Pris . Deckard refuses, but after Bryant makes an overt threat, he reluctantly agrees. Sent to the Tyrell Corporation to ensure that the test works on Nexus-6 models, Deckard discovers that Tyrell's  assistant Rachael  is an experimental replicant who believes herself to be human; Rachael's consciousness has been enhanced with false memories to provide an ""emotional cushion"". As a result, a more extensive test is required to determine if she is a replicant. Trying to find a way to meet with Tyrell, Roy and Leon go to the eye-manufacturing laboratory of Chew , forcing him to divulge the identity of J.F. Sebastian , a gifted designer who works closely with Tyrell. Rachael visits Deckard at his apartment to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo. Dropping the photo to the floor, Rachael leaves in tears after Deckard tells her that her memories are only implants taken from a real person. Sent by Roy, Pris meets and gains the confidence of Sebastian at his apartment, where he lives with manufactured companions. While searching Leon's apartment, Deckard finds a photo of Zhora, and a synthetic snake scale that leads him to a strip club where Zhora works. Deckard retires Zhora, and shortly after is told by Bryant to add Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation headquarters, to his list of retirements. Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd but is disarmed and attacked by Leon, who saw him kill Zhora. Rachael kills Leon using Deckard's gun, and the two return to Deckard's apartment, where he promises not to hunt her. Later they share an intimate moment; Rachael then tries to leave, but Deckard seduces her. Arriving at Sebastian's apartment, Roy tells Pris the others are dead. Sympathetic to their plight, Sebastian reveals that because of a genetic disorder that accelerates his aging, his life will also be cut short. Under a pretext, Sebastian and Roy gain entrance into Tyrell's secure penthouse, where Roy demands more life from his maker. Told that this has proved to be impossible, Roy confesses that he has done ""questionable things"". Tyrell dismisses Roy's guilt, praising Roy's advanced design and his accomplishments. Responding ""Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you into heaven for"", Roy kisses Tyrell, then kills him. Sebastian runs for the elevator followed by Roy, who rides the elevator down alone. Upon entering Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but manages to kill her just as Roy returns. Roy fights Deckard without using his full strength against him. Eventually Deckard is hanging from a rooftop. Just as he is about to fall, Roy saves him. His life ending, Roy delivers a monologue on how his memories are about to be lost and dies in front of Deckard, who watches silently. Gaff arrives and, referring to Rachael, shouts to Deckard ""It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?"" Deckard returns to his apartment to find Rachael alive and sleeping in his bed; as they leave, Deckard finds a small tin-foil unicorn, a calling card left by his origami-making partner Gaff. Depending on the version, Deckard and Rachael either leave the apartment block to an uncertain future, or drive through an idyllic pastoral landscape.artificial intelligence bounty hunter android based on novel or book dystopia genetics futuristic fugitive cyberpunk los angeles, california cult film tech noir neo-noir",True,tt0083658,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,32868943,1,0,0.17389082142857146,3.674315067367597,,,27423749.5,38173749.5,77469142.66666667,102835809.33333333,2230000.0,4,7230000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-29000000.0,2.0,7000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,53472904.0,58972904.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,93931801.0,104931801.0,1.0,,,,3566593.0,9566593.0,1.0,,,,35000000.0,50000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7115000.0,-13385000.0,0.75,1.0,64653273.14837625

Though he has a son, Commodus , the dying emperor wishes to grant temporary leadership to Maximus, hoping eventually to return power to the Roman Senate. When his father tells him of the decision, Commodus, already bitter that Marcus favors Maximus over him, murders his father in a fit of rage and claims the throne. Maximus realizes the truth about Marcus' death, but is betrayed by his friend, General Quintus , who reluctantly instructs the Praetorian guards to carry out Commodus' order to execute Maximus and his wife  and son . Maximus manages to escape, but is unable to return in time to save his family. After burying them, Maximus is found unconscious by slave traders and taken to Zucchabar, a Roman city in North Africa. There, he is bought by Proximo , and forced to fight for his life as a gladiator in arena tournaments. During this time, he befriends gladiators Juba , and Hagen . Juba tells Maximus to have faith that he will be reunited with his family in the afterlife. Maximus proves a fierce gladiator; with nothing left to live for, he is fearless in the arena. He ultimately reaches the prestigious Roman Colosseum, where his group is contracted to fight in a tribute to the Battle of Zama. Concealing his identity with a helmet, he skillfully leads a band of gladiators to defeat an opposing chariot and archer force, earning the crowd's praise. Forced to reveal himself to a stunned Commodus in the arena afterward, the crowd votes to spare his life, and Commodus, being obsessed with the people's approval, appeases them by doing so. Maximus later wins against the undefeated gladiator Tigris, as well as tigers released into the arena, yet refuses to obey Commodus' command to perform the coup de grâce. As a result, he is declared ""Maximus the Merciful"" by the crowd, increasing his popularity and further frustrating Commodus, who cannot kill Maximus without losing favor with the Roman people. Following the fight, Maximus is told by his former servant Cicero ([[Tommy Flanagan  that his army is still loyal to him. Maximus then conspires with Commodus' sister Lucilla  and the senator Gracchus  to rejoin with his army and topple Commodus by force. Commodus, however, suspects his sister of betrayal and forces her to reveal the plot using veiled threats against her young son Lucius . During Maximus's attempted escape, Commodus' guards attack Proximo's gladiator school, killing Hagen and Proximo. Juba and the survivors are imprisoned, but Maximus makes it to the city walls, where he is captured after a failed attempt to save Cicero. Desperate to get Maximus out of the way and prove his own greatness, Commodus arranges a duel with him in the arena. Unknown to the crowd, Commodus stabs a restrained Maximus with a stiletto to gain advantage over him before they enter the arena. During the fight, Maximus manages to disarm Commodus, while Quintus disobeys the emperor's demand for his sword and commands his soldiers to do the same. Commodus then produces the hidden stiletto, but Maximus plunges the blade into Commodus' throat, killing him. With his dying words, Maximus carries out Marcus Aurelius' wishes, calling for Gracchus to be reinstated, the slaves to be freed, and power to be restored to the Senate. As he dies, Maximus reunites with his family in the afterlife. Lucilla then reiterates his wishes and honors his memory. Some time later, Juba buries Maximus' two small figurines of his wife and son in the ground where his friend Maximus died, promising to see him in the afterlife, ""but not yet"".rome italy parent child relationship gladiator arena senate roman empire emperor slavery ancient rome battlefield slave auction ancient world combat chariot philosopher fictionalized history barbarian horde 2nd century successor maximus",False,tt0172495,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,457640427,0,0,3.4431109417475727,-1.1627692044360227,27039663.307692308,48924278.692307696,,,,,,0,,,1284514.0,5.0,21284514.0,1.0,,0.0,,,6035841.666666667,32.0,26579175.0,3.0,3000000.0,24.0,8000000.0,1.0,155452196.66666666,11.0,173785530.0,3.0,,0.0,,,21973249.0,19.0,31973249.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,4868943.0,32868943.0,1.0,,,,,,,12498563.75,40123563.75,4.0,67006296.0,112006296.0,1.0,-39808601.0,7191399.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,-30141861.0,4858139.0,1.0,-6595000.0,405000.0,1.0,,,,78157607.75,100907607.75,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-23385734.0,1614266.0,1.0,84639219.0,120805885.66666667,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,52324493.6,37549160.266666666,11.375,1.8,76394553.2193505

Harry learns that Eddy is a card savant from his bodyguard Barry ""the Baptist"" . Knowing that he cannot win he decides to fix the game. He does so by having Barry watch a feed from a camera hidden behind Eddy, and reveal Eddy's card values to Harry by a system involving a device hidden on Harry's leg. Eddy loses not only his £100,000 buy-in, but an additional £400,000 that Harry bullied him into borrowing to play out the biggest pot of the night. Harry demands repayment within a week. Knowing that Eddy and the others have slim chances of raising half a million pounds within a week, he pulls Eddy's father's bar into the deal as an alternative, in an attempt to get his own revenge on Eddy's father. Barry the Baptist tells Eddy that he will remove a finger from each of the four friends for every day the debt is overdue. After several days with no luck acquiring the funds, Eddy returns home and overhears his neighbours, a gang of thieves led by a man named Dog, planning a heist on some marijuana growers supposedly loaded with cash and drugs. Eddy relays this information to the group, intending for them to rob the neighbours as they come back from their heist. They install taping equipment to record the conversations of their neighbours. Tom acquires a pair of antique shotguns from an underground dealer, known as Nick ""the Greek"" , who also strikes a deal with Rory Breaker , a gangster and sociopath, to buy the stolen drugs. Nick had purchased the guns from a pair of bungling small-time criminals, Gary and Dean , who had stolen them from a bankrupt lord as part of a job for Harry Lonsdale, not realizing that of the entire stolen firearms collection, his only desire was the two antique shotguns. After learning the guns had been sold, an enraged Barry threatens the two into getting them back. The neighbours' heist gets under way; despite a gang member being killed by his own Bren Gun, and an incriminating encounter with a traffic warden , the job is a success. On returning to their flat, the gang is ambushed by the four friends, who take the loot and return later that night to stash the goods next door, before celebrating with a wild night of drinking. Rory discovers that the drugs he was going to purchase were stolen from him, as the marijuana growers were in his employ. Rory interrogates Nick into revealing where the four friends live, and enlists one of the chemists to identify the robbers. Meanwhile, furious about their loss, Dog throws one of his men through the wall of their flat and discovers the taping equipment and eventually the stolen goods. While he counts the money, his men prepare an ambush. Gary and Dean, trying to recover the antique shotguns, call Nick, who directs them to the same address, while Big Chris , Harry's debt collector, departs with his son to the same destination, and the four friends drive home from the bar. Rory and his gang assault the flat and have a shootout with the neighbours, resulting in the deaths of all but Dog and the lone chemist, the latter taking off with the marijuana. Dog is mugged by Big Chris of the shotguns and money during his escape; Gary and Dean spot Big Chris with the guns and hastily follow him, while the four friends return to find their loot missing. Big Chris gives the guns and cash to Harry, but on his return finds Dog threatening to kill his son if he doesn't retrieve the loot. Desperate to get the guns, Gary and Dean attack Harry and Barry at their office, realizing their mistake as they kill each other. The four friends arrive, find everyone dead, and take the cash back. Big Chris suddenly crashes into their car to disable Dog, then brutally bludgeons him to death with his car door. He takes the debt money back from the unconscious friends but allows Tom to leave with the antique shotguns. The friends are arrested, but declared innocent after the traffic warden identified Dog's dead gang as the prime suspects. The four reunite at Eddy's father’s bar and decide that Tom should dispose of the shotguns, which are the only remaining pieces of evidence that links them to the crimes. After Tom leaves, Big Chris arrives to admit he is keeping the debt money for himself and his son, but instead gives them an antique guns catalogue, which reveals that the antique shotguns were each worth a fortune. They quickly call Tom, and the film ends in a both literal and figurative cliffhanger when Tom’s mobile phone starts ringing as he hangs over the side of a bridge, preparing to drop the shotguns into the River Thames and he has to decide whether to answer the phone or drop the guns into the river.ambush alcohol shotgun tea joint machismo cocktail rifle marijuana pot smoking hatchet antique cardsharp anger cult film carjacking piano strip show high stakes",False,tt0120735,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,28356188,1,0,20.004583703703705,-2.5293608277783246,,,,,,,3596911.0,3,31596911.0,1.0,-27641426.0,13.0,358574.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15977742.5,-12022257.5,2.0,1.0,60772021.118274406

One of the other robbers advises Franky to obtain a gun from ex-KGB agent Boris ""The Blade"" . Unbeknownst to Franky, Boris and the robber are brothers and plan to hire a third party to rob him of the diamond. Meanwhile, unlicensed boxing promoter and casino owner Turkish  convinces local gangster ""Brick Top"" ([[Alan Ford  to add the matches of boxer ""Gorgeous George""  to the bets at Brick Top's bookies. However, when Turkish sends his partner Tommy ([[Stephen Graham  and Gorgeous George to purchase a caravan from a group of pikeys, George gets into an impromptu fight with Mickey O'Neil , a bare-knuckle boxing champ who badly injures George with a single punch. Turkish convinces Mickey to replace George in his upcoming match by agreeing to purchase a new caravan for Mickey's mother . Brick Top agrees to the change on the condition that Mickey throws the fight in the fourth round. Boris gives Franky a gun in exchange for a favour: Franky is to place a bet on Boris' behalf at Brick Top's bookies. Avi learns of this and, knowing Franky has a gambling problem, flies to London with his bodyguard ""Rosebud""  to claim the diamond. Boris hires Vinny  and Sol , two pawnbrokers and small-time crooks, to rob Frankie of the diamond while he is at the bookies. The robbery goes awry and Sol, Vinny, and their driver Tyrone ([[Ade  are caught on-camera, but manage to kidnap Franky. Instead of throwing the fight, Mickey knocks his opponent out with a single punch. Infuriated, Brick Top robs Turkish of his savings and demands that Mickey fight again, and lose this time. Meanwhile, Boris retrieves the diamond and executes Franky. As Sol, Vinny, Tyrone, and their accomplice ""Bad Boy"" Lincoln  are puzzling over how to dispose of Franky's body, Brick Top arrives to execute them for robbing his bookies. Sol bargains for their lives by promising Brick Top the stolen diamond, and is given 48 hours to retrieve it. Avi and Doug hire ""Bullet-Tooth"" Tony  to help them find Franky. When the trail leads to Boris, they kidnap him and retrieve the gemstone, closely pursued by Sol, Vinnie, and Tyrone. As they are driving, Tommy carelessly throws Turkish's carton of milk out the window of their car; it splashes over Tony's windshield, causing him to crash. Rosebud is killed, and Boris escapes from the wreck only to be hit by Tyrone's car. Tony and Avi regroup at a pub where they are confronted by Sol, Vinny, and Tyrone. Tony quickly realizes that their pistols are replicas loaded with blanks, and intimidates them into leaving him alone. The wounded Boris arrives with an assault rifle and is killed by Tony, but Sol and Vinny escape with the diamond, which Vinnie hides in his pants. When Tony catches up to them, they tell him that the diamond is back at their pawn shop. Once there, they run out of stall tactics and produce the diamond, but it is promptly swallowed by a dog that Vinnie got from the pikeys. Avi fires wildly at the fleeing dog and accidentally kills Tony. He gives up his pursuit and returns to New York. Mickey refuses to fight again unless Turkish buys an even more lavish caravan for his mother, but Turkish has no money left. Furious, Brick Top has his men vandalize Turkish's gambling arcade and burn down Mickey's mother's caravan while she is asleep inside it. Mickey agrees to fight in order to avoid more carnage, but gets so drunk after his mother's wake the night before that Turkish fears he won't even make it to the fourth round. If he fails to go down as agreed, Brick Top's men will execute Turkish, Tommy, Mickey, and the entire campsite of pikeys. Mickey takes a heavy beating but makes it to the fourth round, when he makes a sudden recovery and knocks out his opponent with a powerful blow. As they flee the building, Brick Top is killed by the pikeys, who have turned the tables on him: Mickey had bet on himself to win, and waited until the fourth round to allow the other pikeys time to ambush and kill Brick Top's men at the campsite. The next morning, Turkish and Tommy find the pikey campsite deserted. They are confronted by the police and don't know what to say, until Vinny's dog suddenly arrives and they claim to be walking it. They are released, while Sol and Vinnie are arrested when the police find the corpses of Franky and Tony in their car. Turkish and Tommy take the dog to a veterinarian to extract a squeaky toy that it had swallowed earlier, and discover the diamond in its stomach as well. They consult Doug about selling the diamond, and he calls Avi who returns to London.england gypsy gambling bare knuckle boxing slang robbery trailer park antwerp boxer pig violence underground fighting cult film diamond heist pikey",False,tt0208092,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,83557872,0,0,7.3557872,-1.1627692044360227,,,27006188.0,28356188.0,22988132.736842107,32888132.736842107,-31748929.0,8,8251071.0,1.0,,0.0,,,27006188.0,2.0,28356188.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,27006188.0,2.0,28356188.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,27006188.0,28356188.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,27006188.0,28356188.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,27006188.0,28356188.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1591545.0,2451545.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,27006188.0,28356188.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,21654482.333333332,7421149.0,1.5,1.0,76394553.2193505

After beating him and urinating on his rug, they realize they are looking for a different person with the same name, and they leave. The Dude discusses the situation with his bowling friends, the timid Donny  and the aggressive Walter . At the instigation of Walter, The Dude decides to seek compensation for the rug from the other Jeffrey Lebowski. The next day, the titular ""Big"" Lebowski, a wheelchair-bound millionaire, refuses The Dude's request. The Dude meets Bunny Lebowski , the Big Lebowski's nymphomaniac trophy wife, while leaving the premises with a rug taken from the mansion. Days later, the Big Lebowski contacts The Dude, revealing that Bunny has been kidnapped. He asks The Dude to act as a courier for the million-dollar ransom because The Dude will be able to confirm whether or not the kidnappers were the same thugs. Later, a different set of thugs enter The Dude's apartment, knock him unconscious, and steal his new rug. When Bunny's kidnappers call to arrange the ransom exchange, Walter tries to convince The Dude to keep the money and give the kidnappers a ""ringer"" suitcase filled with his dirty underwear. The kidnappers escape with the ringer, and The Dude and Walter are left with the million-dollar ransom. Later that night, The Dude's car is stolen, along with the briefcase filled with money. The Dude receives a message from the Big Lebowski's daughter, Maude, who admits to hiring the criminals who knocked him unconscious. The Dude visits her at her art studio, and she reveals that Bunny is a porn starlet working for Jackie Treehorn. She agrees with The Dude's suspicion that Bunny kidnapped herself and asks The Dude to recover the ransom, as it was illegally withdrawn by her father from a charity. The Big Lebowski angrily confronts The Dude over his failure to hand over the money, and hands The Dude an envelope sent to him by the kidnappers which contains a severed toe, presumably Bunny's. The Dude later receives a message that his car has been found. Mid-message, three German nihilists invade the Dude's apartment, identifying themselves as the kidnappers. They interrogate and threaten him for the ransom money. The Dude returns to Maude's studio, where she identifies the German nihilists as Bunny's friends. The Dude picks up his car from the police, but the briefcase with the ransom money is still missing. He and Walter track down the supposed thief, a teenager named Larry Sellers. Their confrontation with Larry is unsuccessful, and the Dude and Walter leave without getting any money or information. Jackie Treehorn's thugs return to The Dude's apartment to bring him to Treehorn's beach house in Malibu. Treehorn inquires about the whereabouts of Bunny, and the money, offering him a cut of any funds recovered. Treehorn then drugs The Dude's drink and The Dude passes out. After a surreal dream blending the themes of bowling, the Persian Gulf War, Maude’s “vaginal” art, and the nihilists, The Dude wakes up in a police car and is then placed in front of the police chief of Malibu. The police chief verbally and physically assaults The Dude and warns him not to return to Malibu. After a cab ride home, The Dude exits and a red sportscar zooms past. Bunny is driving, with all ten toes intact. The Dude is greeted by Maude Lebowski, who seduces him. During post-coital conversation with Maude, The Dude learns that she hopes to conceive a child with him but wants him to have no hand in the child's upbringing. He also finds out that, despite appearances, her father has no money of his own. Maude's late mother was the rich one, and she left her money exclusively to the family charity. In a flash, The Dude unravels the whole scheme: when the Big Lebowski heard that Bunny was kidnapped, he used it as a pretense for an embezzlement scheme, in which he withdrew the ransom money from the family charity to keep for himself. He gave an empty briefcase to The Dude , and was content to let the kidnappers kill Bunny. Meanwhile, it is now clear that the kidnapping was itself a ruse. While Bunny took an unannounced trip, the nihilists  alleged a kidnapping in order to get money from her husband. The Dude and Walter arrive at the Big Lebowski residence, finding Bunny back at home from her trip. They confront the Big Lebowski with their version of the events. The affair apparently over, The Dude and his bowling teammates are suddenly confronted by the nihilists, who have set The Dude's car on fire. They once again demand the million dollars. After hearing what The Dude and Walter know, the nihilists demand all the money in their pockets. Walter responds by throwing a bowling ball one nihilist's ribs, biting another's ear off, and knocking the final nihilist unconscious with their portable radio. However, in the aftermath, the Dude's timid bowling companion Donny has a heart attack and dies. Walter and The Dude go to a cliff overlooking a beach to scatter Donny's ashes. After an informal eulogy which Walter turns into a tribute to the Vietnam War and accidentally covers The Dude with Donny's ashes, Walter suggests, ""Fuck it, Dude. Let's go bowling."" The movie ends back at the bowling alley where ""The Stranger"" , a narrator seen sitting at the bar, speaks to the camera and hints to the audience that Maude may be pregnant with a ""little Lebowski"".white russian dude bowling vietnam veteran carpet nihilism heart attack kidnapping lsd marijuana los angeles, california millionaire cult film cowboy ashes impregnation bowling team unemployed bowling ball neo-noir weeds",False,tt0118715,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,46189568,0,0,2.079304533333333,-2.5293608277783246,,,110968566.0,142540202.36363637,59604296.0,71842962.66666667,,0,,,-2846061.0,7.0,6153939.0,1.0,25382957.0,7.0,33382957.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-2846061.0,7.0,6153939.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,25382957.0,33382957.0,2.0,,,,,,,53611975.0,60611975.0,1.0,8568021.0,27234687.666666668,3.0,8568021.0,27234687.666666668,3.0,,,,25382957.0,33382957.0,2.0,50173707.0,65231307.0,5.0,8568021.0,27234687.666666668,3.0,,,,25382957.0,33382957.0,2.0,53611975.0,60611975.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,53611975.0,60611975.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,10578844.2,24778844.2,5.0,,,,,,,,,15230278.333333334,6563611.666666667,2.625,1.3333333333333333,60772021.118274406

He strikes up a friendship with a wealthy pupil, Tom Hewett, after discovering their common affinity for opera. Tom's older sister, Chloe, is smitten with Chris and the two begin dating. During a family gathering, Chris meets Tom's fiancée, Nola Rice, and they are instantly attracted to each other. Tom's mother, Eleanor, does not approve of her son's relationship with the struggling American actress, a source of tension in the family. Chloe encourages her father, Alec, to give Chris a job as an executive in one of his companies; he begins to be accepted into the family and marriage is discussed. During a storm, after having her choice of profession attacked by Eleanor , Nola leaves the house to be alone. Chris follows Nola outside and confesses his feelings for her, and they passionately kiss in a wheat-field. Feeling guilty, Nola treats this as an accident; Chris, however, wants an ongoing clandestine relationship. Chris and Chloe marry, but Tom ends his relationship with Nola. Chloe, to her distress, does not become pregnant immediately. Chris vainly tries to track down Nola, but meets her by chance some time later at Tate Modern. He discreetly asks for her number and they begin an affair. Whilst Chris is spending time with his wife's family, Nola calls to inform him that she is pregnant. Panicked, Chris asks her to get an abortion, but she refuses, saying that she wants to raise the child with him. Chris's strange behaviour makes Chloe suspect he is having an affair, which he denies. Nola urges Chris to divorce his wife, and he feels trapped and finds himself lying to Chloe as well as Nola. Nola confronts him at his office, and he just escapes public detection. Soon after, Chris takes a shotgun from his father-in-law's home and carries it to his office in a tennis bag. On leaving, he calls Nola on her mobile to tell her he has good news for her. He goes to Nola's building and gains entry into the apartment of her neighbour, Mrs. Eastby. He shoots and kills her, then stages a burglary by ransacking the room and stealing some jewelry and drugs. As Nola returns he shoots her in the stairwell. He then takes a taxi to the theatre to watch a musical with Chloe. Scotland Yard investigates the crime and concludes it was committed by a drug addict stealing money. The following day, the murder is in the news. Chris returns the shotgun and he and Chloe announce her pregnancy. Detective Mike Banner invites Chris for an interview in relation to the murder. Beforehand, Chris throws Mrs. Eastby's jewelry and drugs into the river, but by chance her ring bounces on the railing and falls to the pavement. At the police station, Chris denies knowing Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he features extensively. He confesses his affair to Banner but denies any link to the murder, and appeals to the detectives not to involve him any more in their investigation, as news of the affair may well end his marriage just as he and his wife are expecting a baby. Late one night, Chris sees apparitions of Nola and Mrs. Eastby, who tell him to be ready for the consequences of his actions; he replies that his crimes, though wrong, had been ""necessary"", and that he is able to suppress his guilt. At the same time, Banner dreams that Chris committed the murders. His theory is discredited by his partner, Dowd, who informs him that a drug peddler found murdered on the streets had Mrs. Eastby's ring in his pocket. Banner and Dowd consider the case closed and abandon any further investigation. The film ends with Chloe giving birth to a baby boy named Terrence, and his uncle blessing him not with goodness but luck.love triangle london, england upper class adultery tennis river thames sport love wealth lust gold digger instructor social climbing",True,tt0416320,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,85306374,0,0,4.6870916,-2.6760407675788414,-4796956.0,13203044.0,,,,,14042792.4,7,52942824.2,5.0,17268202.5,4.0,26018202.5,2.0,-3900000.0,2.0,2500000.0,1.0,163003381.5,10.0,264503381.5,2.0,7770887.0,18.0,20604220.333333332,3.0,16960491.0,9.0,21960491.0,2.0,64888198.0,9.0,120221531.33333333,3.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-4796956.0,13203044.0,1.0,45827477.0,79327477.0,2.0,9510217.0,44660217.0,6.0,,,,-4796956.0,13203044.0,1.0,,,,-2090584.5,7409415.5,2.0,52000000.0,58000000.0,1.0,,,,239714897.5,272214897.5,2.0,,,,,,,-4835596.0,5164404.0,1.0,57344077.666666664,83461667.33333333,6.0,,,,204931766.0,244931766.0,1.0,,,,60335816.0,78115816.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,72678664.40952381,40004850.342857145,7.375,2.5714285714285716,109858494.28372188

His mother is unemployed and his father works at a toothpaste factory, responsible for putting the caps on the tubes of toothpaste that come through the line. Down the street is Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, which had recently been reopened after industrial espionage forced him into seclusion and to fire his employees. Charlie's Grandpa Joe had worked for Wonka directly and was laid off when that happened. One day, Wonka announces a contest; the children that find the five Golden Tickets wrapped in ordinary Wonka candy bars will be given a full tour of the factory and a chance for an unknown grand prize. Four children quickly claim their prize: the greedy and gluttonous Augustus Gloop from Dusseldorf, the spoiled and rotten Veruca Salt from Buckinghamshire, the competitive and boastful Violet Beauregarde from Atlanta, and the arrogant and aggressive Mike Teavee from Denver. Charlie hopes to win as well, but neither the bar he is given as a birthday present, or one bought for him by Grandpa Joe contain a ticket. A fifth child in Russia claims to have found the last Ticket. Charlie, on finding a ten-dollar bill, buys a Wonka bar as news breaks that the Russian child's Ticket was fake; Charlie finds the bar he just bought contains the last Golden Ticket. As he races home, bystanders attempt to buy the Ticket from him. Grandpa George reminds Charlie that money is far more common than the Tickets, and convinces Charlie to keep it. Grandpa Joe offers to accompany him on the factory tour. On the day of the tour, the children and their chaperons find Wonka to be a strange, lonely individual, acting odd at the mention of ""family"". As they proceed with the tour, they discover the fantastical factory is now manned by short humans called Oompa-Loompas. The other four children succumb to temptation, and end up caught in the factory workings before being safely recovered by the Oompa-Loompas, albeit in worse shape than at the start of the tour: Augustus falls into the river of chocolate but is rescued before the processing center, Violet expands into a giant blueberry when she tries an experimental piece of chewing gum, Veruca is thrown away as a ""bad nut"" by trained squirrels, and Mike is shrunk down to a few inches tall after being the first person transported by Wonka's new television advertising invention. Wonka congratulates Charlie as the last remaining child and the winner of the grand prize, to become Wonka's heir to the factory. However, Wonka forbids Charlie to bring his family to the factory, and Charlie rejects the offer. Charlie comes to learn that Wonka had a troubled past with his father, Wilbur Wonka.

They have only four days to find it before the valley in which it is hidden will be flooded to create Arkabutla Lake as part of a new hydroelectric project. Early in their escape, while still chained together, they try to jump onto a moving train with some hobos, but fall off due to Pete's inability to get on. They then encounter a blind man  traveling on a manual railroad car. They hitch a ride, and he foretells their futures. They ""seek a great fortune"" and they will ""find a fortune, though it will not be the one they seek"". They will also see many wonders on their journey, including a ""cow on the roof of a cotton house"". They walk to Pete's cousin's house, Wash Hogwallop , who removes their chains, but, because he needs the money, he then turns them in to the police, led by Sheriff Cooley . The authorities set the barn they are sleeping in ablaze, but the trio quickly escapes with the help of Wash's son. When they pass a congregation on the banks of a river, Pete and Delmar are enticed by the idea of baptism, to the immense derision of the skeptical Everett. As the journey continues, they travel briefly with a young guitarist named Tommy Johnson . When asked why he was at a crossroad in the middle of nowhere, he reveals that he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to play the guitar. Tommy describes the devil as being ""White, as white as you folks ... with empty eyes and a big hollow voice. He love to travel around with a mean old hound"". This description matches Sheriff Cooley. The four of them come across a radio station run by a blind man , and record the song ""Man of Constant Sorrow"", calling themselves the Soggy Bottom Boys. Unknown to them, the song becomes famous around the state. The trio part ways with Tommy after their car is discovered by police, and they continue on their own. Among their many encounters, the most notable are a bank robbery with the famous bank robber George Nelson , a run-in with three sirens who seduce and drug them, and a mugging by a one-eyed Bible salesman named Big Dan Teague . Everett and Delmar arrive in Everett’s home town only to find that Everett's wife, Penny , is engaged to Vernon T. Waldrip , campaign manager for gubernatorial candidate Homer Stokes . She refuses to take Everett back and is so ashamed of him that she has been telling their daughters he was killed by a train. While watching a film in a cinema, Everett and Delmar discover that Pete is still alive, the sirens having turned him in to collect the bounty on his head. After Everett and Delmar rescue him from jail, Pete tells them that he gave up the location of the treasure. Everett reveals that he was in prison for practicing law without a license and that there was never any treasure; he only mentioned it to persuade the other men to escape so he could reconcile with his wife. Pete is outraged at this news, primarily because he only had two weeks left on his original sentence, which has now been extended 50 years in light of his escape. The trio stumble upon a Ku Klux Klan rally, where Tommy is about to be lynched. The three disguise themselves as the color guard and attempt a rescue, but Big Dan reveals their identities, and chaos ensues, in which the Grand Wizard is revealed to be Stokes. The trio flee the scene with Tommy cutting the wires supporting a large burning cross, which falls on and incinerates some of the Klansmen . Everett convinces Pete, Delmar, and Tommy to help him win his wife back. Disguised as musicians, they sneak into a Stokes campaign dinner that she is attending. Everett tries to convince his wife that he is ""bona fide"", but she brushes him off. The group begins an impromptu musical performance, during which the crowd recognizes them as the Soggy Bottom Boys and goes wild. Stokes, on the other hand, recognizes them as the group who disgraced his lynch mob and shouts for the music to stop, angering the crowd. He denounces the Soggy Bottom Boys as hostile to the social order, but the crowd is unimpressed and runs him out of town on a rail. Pappy O'Daniel , the sitting governor, seizes the opportunity and endorses the Soggy Bottom Boys, granting them a full pardon while the event is being played on the radio. Penny accepts Everett back, but she demands that he find her original ring if they are to be married. As they leave the dinner, they run into a mob taking a jubilant George Nelson to jail. Delmar comments, ""Looks like George is right back on top again"". The group sets out with Tommy to retrieve the ring, which is at a cabin in the valley that Everett originally claimed to have hidden the treasure in. When they arrive, the police order their arrest and hanging. Everett protests, stating that they had been pardoned on the radio, but Sheriff Cooley ignores their pleas, responding that where he comes from, ""[they] don’t have a radio"". The three begin to despair while Everett improvises a prayer to be saved. Suddenly, the valley is flooded and they are saved from hanging. Using their coffins as rafts, Pete and Delmar jubilantly praise God, while Everett dismisses the incident as luck. He pipes down, though, as a cow floats by on top of a submerged cotton house. Tommy finds the ring in a desk that he is floating on in the new lake, and they return to town. Everett and Penny walk through town with their daughters in tow, singing. Everett presents the ring to Penny, who promptly states that it is the wrong one and demands her ring back. As Everett protests the futility of trying to find it at the bottom of the lake, the blind man rolls by on his railway handcar, his voice joining those of the girls in song.prophecy southern usa music record country music mississippi river seduction musical fraud",False,tt0190590,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,71868327,0,0,1.7641664230769232,-1.1627692044360227,,,50439717.85714286,78118289.28571428,17126295.0,47126295.0,113207122.0,3,238207122.0,1.0,14171753.5,9.0,26171753.5,2.0,,0.0,,,14171753.5,9.0,26171753.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-25061851.0,6.0,14938149.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42400771.5,53400771.5,2.0,14223407.75,31973407.75,4.0,14223407.75,31973407.75,4.0,,,,,,,47009683.833333336,62057683.833333336,6.0,14223407.75,31973407.75,4.0,,,,27318494.0,37651827.333333336,3.0,42400771.5,53400771.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,8568021.0,27234687.666666668,3.0,,,,-11330536.333333334,8336130.333333333,3.0,31189568.0,46189568.0,1.0,,,,,,,14013964.833333334,28347298.166666668,6.0,,,,,,,,,76372194.5,29122194.5,3.375,1.5,76394553.2193505

After orchestrating their deaths, he escapes alone. Batman and Lieutenant Jim Gordon decide to include the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, who is dating Rachel Dawes, in their plan to eradicate the mob. Impressed with Dent's idealism, Bruce Wayne offers him a fundraiser. Mob bosses Sal Maroni, Gambol, and The Chechen are informed by Lau, a Chinese accountant, that he has hidden their funds and fled to Hong Kong to escape the new pressure. The Joker interrupts the meeting, warning that Batman is unhindered by jurisdiction. He offers to kill Batman for half their money, but the mob bosses refuse and Gambol puts a bounty on him. The Joker later kills Gambol and takes control of his men, while Batman captures Lau using a skyhook, delivering him back to Gotham to testify. The Joker issues an ultimatum that people will die each day unless Batman reveals his identity, resulting in the deaths of Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb and the judge presiding over the mob trials. The Joker targets Dent at the fundraiser but Bruce hides him, while Rachel is looked after by Alfred Pennyworth. Gordon foils the Joker's assassination attempt on Mayor Garcia during Loeb's memorial service, apparently sacrificing himself in the process. As a result, Bruce plans to reveal his identity, but Dent instead names himself as Batman to protect the truth. Dent is taken into protective custody and pursued by the Joker across the city as Batman rushes to aid. Gordon, who faked his death, helps apprehend the Joker and is promoted to Commissioner. However, Dent and Rachel disappear. Batman interrogates the Joker and learns each are in separate buildings filled with explosives. Batman intends to find Rachel, instead finding Dent moments before the buildings explode. Rachel dies and half of Dent's face is scarred. The Joker then uses a smuggled bomb inside a prisoner to escape from the police department with Lau. Coleman Reese, an accountant at Wayne Enterprises, deduces Batman's secret identity and plans to blackmail him. The Joker kills Lau and The Chechen, threatening to bomb a hospital unless Reese is killed. Gordon rescues Reese, while the Joker visits Dent in the hospital, convincing him to get revenge. Dent uses his burned lucky coin to decide the fates of those responsible for Rachel's death, killing Maroni and one corrupt cop who had helped kidnap Rachel. After blowing up the hospital and escaping with hostages, the Joker gives two explosive-rigged ferries, one of citizens and the other of Arkham Asylum inmates, the choice to blow the other up until midnight—otherwise, both will explode. Batman asks a reluctant Lucius Fox to use a city-wide tracking device to find the Joker; Fox agrees, but says he will resign immediately afterward. Batman rescues the hostages, who are disguised as Joker's gang, by fighting off the Joker's real men and Gordon's SWAT team. The ferry passengers, refusing to kill each other, are saved as Batman apprehends the Joker. Nevertheless, the Joker gloats that he has won, as the citizens of Gotham will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public knowledge. Batman leaves to find Dent as the Joker is taken into custody. Dent lures Gordon to the building where Rachel died and holds his family hostage, as Batman confronts him. Dent judges the fates of Batman, himself, and Gordon's son with three coin flips. As a result, he shoots Batman in the abdomen, spares himself and flips to determine the boy's fate. Batman, who is wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building, saving the boy but resulting in Dent's death.{{cite web}}. WebCitation archive. Batman convinces Gordon to hold him publicly responsible for the murders so that Dent will remain a symbol of hope for the city. A manhunt for Batman ensues, as he escapes on the Batpod. Alfred burns a letter written by Rachel to Bruce announcing her engagement to Dent, Fox watches the signal tracker self-destruct and Gordon destroys the Bat-Signal before delivering a eulogy at Dent's funeral.dc comics crime fighter secret identity scarecrow sadism chaos vigilante joker superhero based on comic tragic hero organized crime criminal mastermind district attorney super power imax super villain batman",False,tt0468569,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1004558444,1,0,4.430045643243243,-1.6278585820155915,191318313.0,316318313.0,224218673.0,374218673.0,42482.0,48482.0,49999726.0,10,106199726.0,5.0,27767648.0,44.0,67517648.0,8.0,6099456.0,6.0,67599456.0,2.0,191353646.0,22.0,256603646.0,6.0,-9454247.333333334,6.0,8029086.0,3.0,78092667.0,6.0,95092667.0,1.0,59986784.333333336,10.0,148320117.66666666,3.0,,0.0,,,,,,155508744.7142857,254651601.85714287,7.0,,,,273531464.0,383531464.0,1.0,,,,,,,112130577.5,187133577.5,2.0,,,,95490589.1,166390589.1,10.0,230060772.6,328060772.6,5.0,31069531.5,85069531.5,2.0,224218673.0,374218673.0,1.0,110569163.0,188069163.0,2.0,252541642.55555555,341970531.4444444,9.0,,,,,,,158835576.0,259085576.0,4.0,112130577.5,187133577.5,2.0,,,,104394295.5,187894295.5,2.0,,,,,,,235686579.5,343686579.5,2.0,170144422.0,275144422.0,2.0,,,,32581328.5,81581328.5,2.0,224218673.0,374218673.0,107051763.8095238,57692240.0,13.0,4.0,95612307.5388973

There psychiatrist Mark Powell  evaluates him to find if he is delusional. However, prot is unwavering in his ability to provide cogent answers to questions about himself, K-PAX and its civilization. Dr. Powell introduces him to a group of astrophysicists, where prot claims to have journeyed to Earth by means of ""light-travel"" and goes on to display a level of knowledge that puzzles them. prot also exhibits considerable influence over the other patients at the Institute, each of whom believes unquestioningly that he is indeed from K-PAX. prot has explained that he can take one person with him when he returns. Thereafter most of the patients at the institute ask to be taken to K-PAX. Upon learning that many of his patients expect to leave Earth on July 27, Dr. Powell confronts prot, who explains that it is a predetermined date. However, Powell believes this to be a significant date in prot's life, a day on which he suffered a severe psychological trauma. Powell then decides to subject prot to regression hypnosis, which works well. Using information gained from these sessions, Powell figures out that prot may simply be an alter ego  of Robert Porter, whose life has been devastated by the murder of his wife and child in 1996 and his subsequent killing of the perpetrator. On July 27, prot is found lying, catatonic, under his bed and one of the other patients, Bess, is missing. She is never found, and prot never wakes up. The other patients do not recognize Robert as he is being wheeled out of the room. Later Prot explains to Powell how we repeat the same mistakes over and over again, so the only way is to have it right this time around.

Despite the warnings of the chief scientist that the chimps are infected with a virus dubbed ""Rage,"" which he claims is highly contagious and only takes one bite to spread, the activists open the cages anyway and release the chimpanzees. A chimp attacks a female activist and immediately infects her, and she in turn infects the other members of the group, including the chief scientist when he attempts to kill her. 28 days after the events, a bicycle courier named Jim  awakens from a coma in St Thomas' Hospital. He finds the hospital deserted and seemingly empty. He finds a medical suit and dresses. Outside, he discovers London deserted with signs of catastrophe everywhere. Jim then wanders into a seemingly abandoned church, only to alert a small group of Rage-infected people who were hiding there. As he tries to approach a priest who's been infected, they spot him and try to attack him, giving chase. At the last minute, he is saved by Selena  and Mark , who throw Molotov cocktails at Jim's pursuers, resulting in the blowing up of a petrol station. Afterwards, they rush him to their hideout in the London Underground. There they reveal that while Jim was comatose from his accident, an unknown virus spread uncontrollably among the populace, turning most people into rabid, psychotic ""infected,"" resulting in societal collapse. They also explain that infection has been reported in Paris and New York City. The next morning, Selena and Mark accompany Jim to his parents' house in Deptford where he discovers that they have committed suicide, leaving a note for him. That night, two of the infected see a candle Jim lights in the kitchen and attack. Mark is badly cut and covered in infected blood; Selena quickly kills him, later explaining to Jim that the Rage virus overwhelms its victims in no more than 20 seconds. This necessitates the immediate killing of people who may have been infected. She also assures him that, should he get infected, she would kill him ""in a heartbeat."" After leaving, they discover two more survivors, Frank  a cab driver, and his teenage daughter, Hannah , holed up in a block of flats, and are invited to spend the rest of the night with them. Frank informs them the next day that supplies, particularly water, are dwindling, and plays them a pre-recorded radio broadcast apparently transmitted by an Army blockade near Manchester, who claim to have ""the answer to infection"" and invite any survivor to try to reach their safe haven. The survivors board Frank's cab in search of the signal source and during the trip bond with one another in various situations. When the four reach the deserted blockade, Frank is infected when a drop of blood from a dead body falls into his eye. As he succumbs, he is killed by the arriving soldiers, who then take the remaining group to a fortified mansion under the command of Major Henry West . After settling in the mansion, West promises the three protection from the infected. However, Jim quickly discovers that West's ""answer to infection"" involves waiting for the infected to starve to death, and his broadcast of the radio message was launched to attract female survivors into sexual slavery to rebuild the population with his platoon's members. Jim attempts to escape with Selena and Hannah, but is captured by the soldiers, along with a Sergeant Farrell , who disagrees with the major's plan and tried to stop the other soldiers from imprisoning the group. During their imprisonment, Farrell theorizes that there is no worldwide pandemic, and that only Great Britain has been quarantined, which is proved when a plane flies over, possibly a NATO plane scouting the land. The next day, Selena and Hannah are made to dress in evening wear and prepare for rape, as two soldiers lead Jim and Farrell to be executed. After his escorts quarrel after killing Farrell, Jim manages to escape and notices the contrail of a jet aircraft flying high overhead, which largely confirms Farrell's theory. After luring West and one of his men to the blockade and ambushing them, Jim runs back to the soldiers' headquarters where he unleashes Mailer, an infected soldier whom West kept chained outside for observation. Mailer attacks the soldiers in the mansion, while Jim sets out to rescue the girls, who had been split up in the chaos. Selena, held hostage by Corporal Mitchell , is then rescued by Jim, who arrives and savagely kills Mitchell with his bare hands. Selena mistakes Jim for an infected and raises her machete to kill him, but when she hesitates, Jim remarks, ""That was longer than a heartbeat."" The two kiss, reunite with Hannah, and run to Frank's cab, only to encounter a vengeful West, who shoots Jim in the stomach. Hannah commandeers the cab and backs it up to the front door, where Mailer drags West out through the rear window and kills him. She then drives away with Jim and Selena. Selena and Hannah rush Jim to a deserted hospital, where Selena performs life-saving emergency procedures, but to no avail, as he falls into the coma again. They leave with his body. 28 days later, Jim is shown waking up in recovery again, this time at a remote cottage. Downstairs, he finds Selena sewing large swaths of fabric when Hannah appears. The three rush outside and unfurl a huge cloth banner, adding the final letter to the word ""HELLO"" laid out on the meadow. As a lone Hawker Hunter T.7 fighter jet flies over the landscape, infected people are shown lying by the side of a road, dying of starvation. The jet flies past the three waving survivors and their distress sign and calls in a rescue helicopter. As it flies away Selena says with a smile, ""Do you think they saw us this time?""london, england taxi manchester city submachine gun gas station survivor daughter laboratory hospital zombie brutality church violence rage epidemic cult film military virus waking from coma animal research",False,tt0289043,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,82719885,0,0,15.543976999999998,0.06660377319308829,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,-11100000.0,6.0,16900000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-9369144.0,6.0,1630856.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,50282030.0,55957030.0,2.0,-23385734.0,1614266.0,1.0,,,,,,,116772030.5,141772030.5,2.0,58273976.5,80273976.5,2.0,,,,14410781.0,21410781.0,2.0,,,,58273976.5,80273976.5,2.0,,,,,,,124492582.66666667,147492582.66666666,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-11624365.0,1375635.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,851475550.0,976475550.0,1.0,,,9265428.0,-10234572.0,1.5,1.5,95886927.05495417

She was raised in the Republic of Matobo, a fictional African country, but has dual citizenship. The United Nations is considering indicting Edmond Zuwanie ([[Earl Cameron , president of Matobo, to stand trial in the International Criminal Court. Initially a liberator, over the past 20 years he has become as corrupt and tyrannical as the government he overthrew, and is now responsible for ethnic cleansing and other atrocities within Matobo. Zuwanie is soon to visit the United Nations and put forward his own case to the General Assembly, in an attempt to avoid the indictment. A security scare forces the evacuation of the UN building, and Silvia returns at night to reclaim some personal belongings. At that time she overhears discussion of an assassination plot, and runs scared from the building when those discussing the plot become aware of her presence. The next day, Silvia recognizes words in a meeting where she is interpreting from phrases she overheard the night before, and reports the incident to UN security; the target of the plot appears to be Zuwanie himself. They, in turn, call in the United States Secret Service, who assign Tobin Keller  and Dot Woods  to investigate, as well as protect Zuwanie when he arrives. Keller learns that Silvia has, in the past, been involved in a Matoban guerrilla group, that her parents and sister were killed by land mines laid by Zuwanie's men, and that she has dated one of Zuwanie's political opponents. Although Keller is suspicious of Silvia's story, the two grow close and Keller ends up protecting her from attacks on her person. Silvia later finds that her brother Simon and her lover Xola were killed . The purported assassin is discovered while Zuwanie is in the middle of his address to the General Assembly, and security personnel rush Zuwanie to a safe room for his protection. Silvia, anticipating this, has been hiding in the safe room, and confronts Zuwanie and intends to kill him herself. Keller determines that the assassination plot is a false flag operation created by Zuwanie to gain credibility that his rivals are terrorists and to deter potential supporters of his removal. Keller rushes to the safe room and arrives just in time to prevent Silvia from murdering Zuwanie. Zuwanie is indicted, and Silvia is expelled from the USA, returning home to Matobo soon afterwards.new york city dictator africa destruction of a civilization assassination resistance fbi revenge murder united nations witness to murder resistance fighter",False,tt0373926,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,162944923,1,0,1.0368115375,-2.6760407675788414,88198761.66666667,121865428.33333333,72759592.2,108209592.2,48857185.5,74882185.5,71700368.66666667,10,120700368.66666667,6.0,6839317.5,19.0,20839317.5,2.0,-16693515.0,9.0,3639818.3333333335,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,5350214.0,1.0,11850214.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,21975011.0,121975011.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,94013509.0,173013509.0,1.0,-5176724.2,21003275.8,5.0,118582776.0,134582776.0,1.0,95064691.25,125303024.58333333,12.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31189568.0,46189568.0,1.0,,,,11783339.5,26283339.5,2.0,,,,94013509.0,173013509.0,1.0,-8224415.0,3275585.0,1.0,,,,36590641.333333336,66257308.0,3.0,,,,179352888.5,262352888.5,2.0,,,39257429.625,16799096.291666668,4.875,3.0,109858494.28372188

One night, after intoxicating themselves on ""milk plus"", they engage in an evening of ""ultra-violence"", including beating an elderly vagrant , and fighting a rival gang led by Billyboy .Both Burgess' novel and Stanley Kubrick's published movie script have this character's name as one word ""Billyboy"" although the Internet Movie Database lists him in the credits with two words ""Billy Boy"". Stealing a car, they drive to the country home of writer F. Alexander ([[Patrick Magee , where they beat Mr. Alexander to the point of crippling him for life. Alex then rapes his wife  while intoning ""Singin' in the Rain"". The next day, while truant from school, Alex is approached by probation officer Mr. P. R. Deltoid , who is aware of Alex's violence and cautions him. In response, Alex visits a record store where he picks up two girls. Alex and the girls have sex in a fast-motion scene. After the events of the night before, his droogs express discontent with Alex's petty crimes, demanding more equality and more high-yield thefts. Alex reasserts his leadership by attacking them and throwing them into a canal. That night, Alex invades the mansion of a wealthy ""cat""-woman , filled with erotic art. While his droogs remain at the front door, Alex bludgeons the woman with a phallic statue. At the climax of the attack, close-ups of the erotic paintings on the walls are barely visible in single-frame sequences. Hearing police sirens, Alex tries to run away, but is betrayed by his droogs. Dim smashes a pint bottle of milk across his face, leaving him stunned and bleeding. Alex is captured and brutally beaten by the police. A gloating Deltoid spits in his face and informs him that the woman subsequently died in the hospital, making him a murderer. Alex is sentenced to 14 years incarceration. Two years into the sentence, the Minister of the Interior  arrives at the prison looking for test subjects for the Ludovico technique, an experimental aversion therapy for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks; Alex readily volunteers. The process involves drugging the subject, strapping him to a chair, propping his eyelids open, and forcing him to watch violent movies. Alex, initially pleased by the violent images he sees, becomes nauseated due to the drugs. He realizes that one of the films' soundtracks is by his favourite composer, Ludwig van Beethoven, and that the Ludovico technique will make him sick when he hears the music he loves. He tries unsuccessfully to end the treatment. After two weeks of the Ludovico technique, the Minister of the Interior puts on a demonstration to prove that Alex is ""cured"". He is shown to be incapable of fighting back against an actor  who insults and attacks him, and he becomes violently ill at the sight of a topless woman . Though the prison chaplain  protests at the results, saying that ""there's no morality without choice"", the prison governor  asserts that they are not interested in the moral questions but only ""the means to prevent violence"". Alex is released and finds that his possessions have been confiscated by the police to help make restitution to his victims, and that his parents have rented out his room. Homeless, Alex encounters the same elderly vagrant from before, who attacks him with several other friends. Alex is saved by two policemen but is shocked to discover they are two of his former droogs, Dim and Georgie. They drag Alex to the countryside, where they beat and nearly drown him. The dazed Alex wanders the countryside before coming to the home of Mr Alexander, and collapses. Alex wakes up to find himself being treated by Mr Alexander and his manservant, Julian . Mr Alexander does not recognize Alex as his attacker but has read about his treatment in the newspapers. Seeing Alex as a political weapon to usurp the government, Mr Alexander intends to expose the Ludovico technique as a step toward totalitarianism by way of mind control. As Mr. Alexander prepares to introduce Alex to colleagues , he hears Alex singing ""Singin' in the Rain"" in the bath, and the memories of the earlier assault return. With his colleagues' help, Mr. Alexander drugs Alex and places him in a locked upstairs bedroom, playing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony through the floor below. Alex, in excruciating pain, throws himself from the window and is knocked unconscious by the fall. Alex wakes up in a hospital, having dreamt about doctors messing around inside his head. While being given a series of psychological tests, Alex finds that he no longer has an aversion to violence. The Minister of the Interior arrives and apologizes to Alex, letting him know that Mr Alexander has been ""put away"". He offers to take care of Alex and get him a job in return for cooperation with his PR counter-offensive. As a sign of goodwill, the Minister brings in a stereo system playing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Alex then realizes that instead of an adverse reaction to the music, he sees an image of himself having sex in the snow with a woman in front of an approving crowd dressed in Beethoven-era fashion. He then states, in a sarcastic and menacing voice-over, ""I was cured, all right!""street gang sexuality based on novel or book parent child relationship great britain social worker society dystopia satire controversial violence cult film futuristic society",False,tt0066921,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,26589000,0,0,11.085909090909093,9.732470303796497,,,7640272.0,9440272.0,,,,0,,,4500000.0,7.0,8000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23863424.0,29130090.666666668,3.0,,,,56700000.0,68700000.0,1.0,,,,32170136.0,39070136.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23863424.0,29130090.666666668,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8000000.0,4500000.0,0.875,1.0,65437336.942640275

Paul Rusesabagina , the manager of the Sabena owned Hôtel des Mille Collines, is Hutu, but his wife Tatiana , is Tutsi. His marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, most prominently Georges Rutaganda , a friendly goods supplier to the hotel who is also the local leader of Interahamwe, a brutal anti-Tutsi militia. The UN Peacekeeping forces, led by Canadian Colonel Oliver , are unable to take assertive action against the Interahamwe since they are forbidden to intervene in the genocide. The foreign nationals are evacuated, but the Rwandans are left behind. When the UN forces attempt to evacuate a group of refugees, including Paul's family, they are ambushed and must turn back. In a last-ditch effort to save the refugees, Paul pleads with the Rwandan Army General, Augustin Bizimungu  for assistance. However, when Paul's bribes no longer work, he blackmails the General with threats of being tried as a war criminal. Soon after, the family and the hotel refugees are finally able to leave the besieged hotel in a UN convoy.

Two beings from this era travel back in time to 1984 Los Angeles: One is a Terminator , a cyborg assassin programmed to kill Sarah Connor ; the other is Kyle Reese , a human resistance fighter sent to protect her. After killing two other Sarah Connors listed in the telephone directory, the Terminator tracks its target to a nightclub. Kyle saves Sarah from the Terminator's attack and the two make an escape. Kyle explains that in the near future an artificial intelligence network called Skynet will become self-aware and initiate a nuclear holocaust of mankind. Sarah's yet-unborn son John will rally the survivors and lead a resistance movement against Skynet and its army of machines. With the Resistance on the verge of victory, Skynet has sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John can be born, as a last-ditch effort to avert the formation of the Resistance. The Terminator is an emotionless and efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton, but with an external layer of living tissue that makes it resemble a human being. Kyle and Sarah are again attacked by the Terminator, leading to a car chase and their arrest. Lieutenant Ed Traxler  and Detective Hal Vukovich  tell Sarah that Kyle is insane. Kyle is questioned by psychologist Dr. Silberman , who concludes that he is paranoid and delusional. The Terminator attacks the police station and kills many police officers, including Traxler and Vukovich, in its attempt to locate Sarah, but she and Kyle escape and seek refuge in a motel. Kyle confesses that he has long been in love with Sarah, having been given a photograph of her by her son John. Sarah reciprocates Kyle's feelings and they have sex. The Terminator tracks them to the motel and wounds Kyle. In the ensuing chase the Terminator is caught in the blast of an exploding gasoline tank truck. With its flesh coating burned away, it pursues Sarah and Kyle into a factory. Kyle jams a pipe bomb into its abdomen, causing an explosion which severely damages it, but at the cost of his own life. Still partially functional, the Terminator tries to kill Sarah. She leads it into a hydraulic press and crushes it, causing it to deactivate. Later, a pregnant Sarah is traveling through Mexico. Along the way she records audio tapes which she intends to pass on to her unborn son, John. She debates whether to tell him that Kyle is his father.

Shiftless young drifter Joe Taylor works on a barge which operates from Glasgow, on the River Clyde, along the Forth and Clyde and Union Canals to Edinburgh. He shares the cramped on-board living quarters with its operators, Les and Ella Gault, and their young son Jim. One day Joe and Les pull the body of a young woman, naked except for a petticoat, from the water. Via flashbacks, we learn Joe knew her, and scenes involving his relationship with office worker Cathie Dimly are juxtaposed with those set in the present time. After finding Cathie's body, Joe and Les go to a local pub to play darts. Joe leaves Les behind and returns to the barge, where Ella succumbs to his advances. Not wanting to disturb the sleeping Jim, the two engage in sex on the towpath. It proves to be the first of many such encounters they enjoy whenever they can find a few moments away from Les. In the past, Joe meets Cathie on a beach and the two soon are living together. He aspires to be a writer and spends his days banging on a battered typewriter while she works to support them. Joe begins to suffer from chronic writer's block and Cathie, unhappy with his lack of productivity, accuses him of taking advantage of her. He packs his meager belongings and moves out. After tossing his typewriter in a canal, he meets Les, who offers him a job on the barge. Les eventually becomes aware of Ella and Joe's affair and moves out of the barge, which belongs to her, and Ella and Joe drift into a more serious relationship. When she receives word her brother-in-law has died, she and Joe visit her sister Gwen and invite her to spend a couple of weeks with them. One evening, on the pretext Gwen would like to see a movie, she and Joe leave the barge and go to a pub. After a few drinks, the two have sex in a deserted alley. Eventually, Ella's desire to settle in the suburbs and her no-nonsense supervision of the barge's daily commercial activities put a damper on the once-unbridled passion in her relationship with Joe, and he packs and leaves. In the past, Joe and Cathie reunite on the waterfront and have sex beneath a parked truck. She reveals she is pregnant with his child, and when Joe nonchalantly begins to walk away, she runs after him, trips, and falls into the water while dressed only in her petticoat. Joe makes no move to rescue her and, when she fails to surface, he panics and runs away. Past and present converge. Daniel Gordon, a plumber whom Cathie was casually seeing, is arrested and tried for her murder, and Joe spends a few days in the courtroom listening to testimony. Guilt-stricken, he writes an anonymous note absolving Daniel of the crime and leaves it where a courthouse guard can find it. It has no effect on the proceedings, and Daniel is found guilty and sentenced to hang. Unwilling to risk his life, Joe opts not to confess how Cathie really died and sets off for parts unknown.individual scotland sex adultery glasgow, scotland river boat court case pregnancy dying and death author extramarital affair told in flashback neo-noir",False,tt0289635,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,2500000,1,0,-1.56,-14.415123713336484,1685582.5,15185582.5,,,,,26145402.0,7,53895402.0,4.0,104056873.0,3.0,144056873.0,1.0,433357.5,7.0,8933357.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,20984230.0,43984230.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-5732806.0,267194.0,1.0,,,,-3423849.0,10651151.0,4.0,,,,,,,-8815745.0,184255.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,68961877.5,43545210.833333336,2.125,2.3333333333333335,79569518.43496008

After getting dumped by his current girlfriend, Laura , he decides to look up some of his old flames in an attempt to figure out what he keeps doing wrong in his relationships. He spends his days at his record store, Championship Vinyl, where he holds court over the customers that drift through. Helping Rob in his task of musical elitism are Dick  and Barry , the ""musical moron twins,"" as he refers to them. Armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of all things musical, they compile ""top five"" lists for every conceivable occasion, openly mock the ignorance of their customers, and, every so often, sell a few records. Rob and the staff have a strong dislike for two shoplifting skateboarder teenagers, Vince  and Justin . One day, he listens to a recording that they did  and offers them a record deal, starting his own label called ""Top 5 Records"". During his off hours, he pines for his lost girlfriend Laura and does his best to win her back. Rob soon hears that Laura's father, who liked Rob, has died, and attends his funeral with Laura. Shortly after the reception, Rob realizes he never committed to Laura and always had one foot out the door. This made him realize he neglected his own future in the process. Afterwards, he and Laura move back in together again, and she organizes a celebration of the recently released single by the two delinquents, where Barry's band plays ""Let's Get It On"" and is delightful .

Will does not need to work and spends most of his free time watching television, and reading about pop culture. When Will's friends, Christine  and John , ask him to be the godfather of their second child, Will bluntly refuses, insisting that he ""really is that shallow"". In an attempt to avoid spending time with the couple, Will meets Angie , a single mother, but the two only share a brief relationship which, to Will's surprise actually ends amicably. Afterward, Will comes up with the idea of attending a single-parents group called ""SPAT""  to meet potential female partners. As part of his ploy, he claims to have a two-year-old son named Ned. His plan succeeds and he meets Suzie . Will's pursuit to court Suzie takes him to one of the group's functions — a picnic — where he meets Marcus , the 12-year-old son of Suzie's friend, Fiona . At the picnic, Marcus accidentally kills a duck with a stale loaf of bread while trying to feed it. When a park keeper questions him about it, Will quickly defends Marcus by claiming the duck was already dead. Afterward, when Will and Suzie take Marcus home, they find Fiona in the living room, overdosed on pills in a suicide attempt. Marcus begins to be uncomfortable with staying at home alone with his mother, so he tries to get Will to date her so she won't be so lonely. After a single date this plan fails so Marcus follows Will around and discovers that Will is actually childless and had been faking being a single parent. Marcus then appears on Will's doorstep and blackmails him into letting him hang out at his apartment after school every day instead of going straight home. Will is initially against Marcus spending time at his place, but when Marcus is chased there one day by bullies Will begins to realize the importance of his presence in Marcus's life. He starts helping Marcus fit in by taking him shopping for new shoes. Unfortunately, the shoes are stolen by bullies, causing a fight among Marcus, Fiona, and Will. At school, Marcus develops a crush on a grunge girl named Ellie , and his popularity steadily improves. Will begins a relationship with a single mother named Rachel . Will lets Rachel believe that Marcus is his son in order to appear interesting to her. Later, in an attempt to be honest with her, he reveals that Marcus is not really his son, but his lie backfires and their relationship ends. One day, Marcus comes home from school to find his mother crying in the living room. Marcus attempts to unburden himself to Will, who is unreceptive, as he is still upset about the breakup with Rachel. Will tells Marcus that he can't help him and the two have a fight. Marcus decides that the only way to help his mother is to sing at the school variety show - an act which Ellie deems ""social suicide"", warning that the other children will crucify him. Will continues his superficial existence, but realises that it doesn't fulfill him the way it did before. Will crashes a SPAT meeting and implores Fiona not to attempt suicide again. She assures him that she has no plans to do so in the immediate future and also tells him that Marcus has decided to sing at the school show that day. Will and Fiona rush to the school to stop Marcus from committing social suicide, and Will finds Rachel in the school audience watching her son in the show. Will makes his way backstage to stop Marcus from singing, but Marcus is unswayed and believes that his singing will make his mother happy. Marcus proceeds to sing a shrill, out-of-tune rendition of ""Killing Me Softly with His Song"" as the student body taunts him. Suddenly, Will appears onstage with a guitar to accompany Marcus for the rest of the song. With Will's assistance, the school children accept Marcus's performance, giving him mild applause at the end. Seeing this, Will continues on with an unnecessary solo to take the negative attention off Marcus. The following Christmas, Will hosts a celebration at his place where Marcus, Rachel, Rachel's son Ali, Fiona and Ellie are present. The idea of Will marrying Rachel is brought up, but Marcus seems unenthusiastic, believing that couples have no future without ""backup"" to their relationships.london, england rock 'n' roll single parent based on novel or book rap music bachelor becoming an adult friendship single",False,tt0276751,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,129000000,1,0,3.7777777777777777,0.06660377319308829,66847693.428571425,101204836.28571428,,,,,107123222.1111111,14,124012111.0,9.0,,0.0,,,-4686356.0,4.0,4313644.0,1.0,10561176.5,4.0,48561176.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32837029.25,50837029.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,288119900.0,310869900.0,2.0,13564027.0,14564027.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9283175.0,31709559.5,4.0,,,,,,,,,,26365354.0,33665354.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,58962310.5,37666014.2037037,2.75,4.0,95886927.05495417

James Bond – agent 007, sometimes referred to as simply '007' – is sent to New York to investigate the first murder. Kananga is also in New York, visiting the United Nations. Just after Bond arrives, his driver is shot dead by a passing motorist, while taking Bond to meet Felix Leiter of the CIA. Bond is nearly killed in the ensuing car crash.  A trace on the killer's licence plate eventually leads Bond to Mr. Big, a ruthless and cunning gangster who runs a chain of Fillet of Soul restaurants throughout the United States. It is here that Bond first meets Solitaire, a beautiful virgin tarot expert who has the uncanny ability to see both the future and remote events in the present. Mr. Big, who is actually Kananga in disguise, demands that his henchmen kill Bond, but Bond overpowers them and escapes unscathed. Bond flies to San Monique, where he meets Rosie Carver, a CIA double agent. They meet up with a friend of Bond's, Quarrel Jr., who takes them by boat to Solitaire's home. Bond suspects Rosie of working for Kananga. She is shot dead, remotely, by Kananga, to stop her confessing the truth to Bond. Inside Solitaire's house, Bond uses a stacked tarot deck of cards, that show only ""The Lovers"", to trick her into thinking that seduction is in her future, and then seduces her. Solitaire loses her ability to foretell the future when she loses her virginity to Bond and is forced into cooperating with Bond to bring down Kananga. Bond and Solitaire escape by boat and fly to New Orleans. There, Bond is captured by 'Mr. Big', who reveals himself to be Kananga. It transpires that Kananga is producing two tons of heroin and is protecting the poppy fields by exploiting locals' fear of voodoo and the occult. Through his alter ego, Mr. Big, Kananga plans to distribute the heroin free of charge at his Fillet of Soul restaurants, which will increase the number of addicts. Kananga also believes that other drug dealers, namely the Mafia, cannot compete with his giveaway, to which Kananga can later charge high prices for the heroin, after he has simultaneously cultivated huge drug dependency and bankrupted his competitors. Kananga asks Bond if he has slept with Solitaire. When he finds out that he has, Kananga turns Solitaire over to Baron Samedi to be sacrificed, as her ability to read tarot cards is gone. Meanwhile, Kananga's one-armed henchman, Tee Hee Johnson, leaves Bond to be eaten by crocodiles at a farm in the Louisiana backwoods. Bond escapes by running along the animals' backs to safety. He sets the farm on fire and steals a speedboat. He is then pursued by Kananga's men, as well as local Sheriff J.W. Pepper and the Louisiana State Police. Back in San Monique, Bond rescues Solitaire from the voodoo sacrifice with a .44 Magnum Smith & Wesson Model 29 revolver and throws Samedi into a coffin of snakes. Bond and Solitaire escape below ground into Kananga's lair. Kananga captures them both and proceeds to lower them into a shark tank. Bond escapes and forces a shark gun pellet into Kananga's mouth, causing him to blow up like a balloon, float to the top of the cave, and explode. After the job is done, Felix puts Bond and Solitaire onto a train and out of the country. Tee Hee Johnson follows Bond and Solitaire onto the train and tries to kill Bond, but loses his prosthetic arm in a fight with him and is flung out of the window. As the film ends, Bond comforts Solitaire, and a laughing Samedi is revealed perched on the front of the speeding train.london, england new york city bomb england spy sheriff based on novel or book dual identity secret identity boat drug traffic tarot cards heroin crocodile jamaica secret mission secret intelligence service drug smuggle voodoo tombstone speedboat  aftercreditsstinger",False,tt0070328,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,161777836,1,0,22.111119428571424,14.813592686391473,74505692.55555555,79522359.22222222,97143473.14285715,102022044.57142857,97143473.14285715,102022044.57142857,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,115600304.5,120450304.5,2.0,,,,76898765.0,78898765.0,1.0,,,,97143473.14285715,102022044.57142857,7.0,,,,108819547.0,116019547.0,1.0,10994795.333333334,18514795.333333332,3.0,,,,,,,,,,108819547.0,116019547.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,75437147.42857143,78795004.57142857,7.0,,,,,,,97143473.14285715,102022044.57142857,,,0.0,,100807754.58062708

He and the other resident children are treated poorly and given very little food. Facing starvation, the boys select Oliver  to ask for more food at the next meal, which he tentatively does. This results in Oliver being chastised, and the workhouse officials, who are wealthy, well-fed, hypocritical men, decide to get rid of him. After nearly being sold as an apprentice to a cruel chimney sweep, Oliver is sent to Mr. Sowerberry, a coffin-maker, whose wife and senior apprentice take an instant dislike to the newcomer. After more poor treatment, Oliver snaps and attacks Noah, the snotty older apprentice, for having insulted his mother. Knowing his life with the Sowerberrys will only get worse, Oliver escapes on foot. With little food, Oliver determines to walk 70 miles to London. After he collapses from exhaustion, a kindly old woman gives him food and lodgings for the night. After a week of travel, he arrives at the city, barefoot and penniless. He meets Jack Dawkins, or “The Artful Dodger,” a boy-thief who takes Oliver to his home and hideout at Saffron Hill that he shares with many other young pickpockets and their eccentric elderly leader, Fagin. Soon, Oliver is being groomed to join their gang. On his first outing with the pickpockets, two of the boys steal a man’s handkerchief and Oliver is framed. However he is proven innocent by an eyewitness, and the owner of the handkerchief  takes pity on Oliver, who had collapsed from a fever in the courtroom. Brownlow informally adopts Oliver, giving him new clothes and the promise of a good education. However, while out running an errand for Brownlow, Oliver is forcibly returned to the pickpocket gang by Fagin’s associate, the evil Bill Sikes, and the young prostitute Nancy . Fagin and Sikes worried that Oliver would “peach,” and tell the authorities about their criminal activity. Oliver is put under supervision until Bill Sikes discovers the boy’s connection to the rich Mr. Brownlow. Sikes and his accomplice, Toby Crackit, force Oliver to aid them in robbing Brownlow’s house. They are discovered and Oliver is wounded in a brief shootout between Brownlow and Sikes. As the three escape, Bill decides to murder Oliver to ensure his silence, but falls into a nearby river before he can take action. Sikes survives his near-drowning, but is confined to bed with a heavy fever. Fagin, despite treating Oliver kindly, remains crime-focused and plots with Sikes to kill Oliver when Sikes has recovered. Nancy has a maternal love for Oliver and does not want to see him hurt, but she is controlled by the abusive Sikes. She drugs Bill, and goes to Brownlow’s house where she arranges to have him meet her on London Bridge at midnight so she can provide information about Oliver. At the meeting, Nancy cautiously reveals that Oliver is staying with Fagin, and that the authorities will easily find them. Brownlow leaves to call the police. The Artful Dodger, who had been sent by a suspicious Fagin to spy on Nancy, had heard everything and is bullied by Bill Sikes to give up the information. Sikes is furious at Nancy’s betrayal, and brutally beats her to death in their apartment. The next day, information about Oliver and Fagin appear in the newspaper, along with Nancy’s murder and Sikes is a suspect. Sikes’s ever-present dog, Bullseye, is a dead giveaway to his identity. After unsuccessfully trying to kill the dog, Sikes takes up residence with Toby Crackit. Fagin, Oliver, and the boys are hiding there too, after escaping their previous location before the police could find it.

He vows to avenge their deaths in a lifelong battle against crime in the guise of Batman while concealing his secret identity, adopting the public face of a billionaire playboy and head of Wayne Enterprises. Years later, Gotham City is controlled by crime boss Carl Grissom . Despite the best efforts of newly-elected district attorney Harvey Dent  and police commissioner James Gordon , the Gotham City Police Department remains corrupt. Reporter Alexander Knox  and photojournalist Vicki Vale  begin investigating the rumors of a shadowy vigilante figure dressed as a bat who has been fighting criminals throughout the city. Vicki and Knox attend a benefit at Wayne Manor, where Bruce is taken by Vicki's charms and spends the night with her. That same night, Grissom's second in command, Jack Napier , is sent to raid the Axis Chemicals factory. After the police receive a tip-off and arrive to arrest him, Napier realizes he has been set up by his boss as revenge for his affair with Grissom's mistress. In the midst of the shoot-out, Batman arrives and takes out Napier's henchmen. In the ensuing struggle, Napier shoots at Batman, who deflects the bullet with his metal-reinforced gauntlet and sends it back in Napier's face, tearing it open. Reeling from the pain, Napier topples over a platform rail and falls into a vat of chemicals, even as Batman tries to save him. The chemicals and a botched attempt at plastic surgery leave him with chalk white skin, red lips, green hair, and a permanent rictal grin. Driven insane by his reflection, he reinvents himself as ""the Joker"", a master criminal and ""homicidal artist"". After killing Grissom, the Joker takes over his empire and holds the city at his mercy by chemically altering everyday hygiene products, causing those using a certain combination of products to laugh to death. Batman attempts to track down the Joker, who has become obsessed with Vicki. During an encounter with the Joker, Batman recognizes him as the criminal who murdered his parents. Bruce's butler, Alfred Pennyworth , lets Vicki into the Batcave, where she tells Bruce she is in love with him. Bruce promises to pursue a relationship with her after he has defeated the Joker. Batman destroys the factory the Joker used to make the poisoned products and creates an antidote. The Joker holds a parade through Gotham, luring its citizens on to its streets by dispensing money, intending to kill them with lethal gas. Batman foils his plan, but the Joker kidnaps Vicki and takes her to the top of a cathedral church. After a fight with Batman, the Joker tries to escape on a helicopter, but Batman uses a grappling hook to snare the Joker's legs to a gargoyle; the Joker falls to his death when the gargoyle breaks loose of its moorings. Commissioner Gordon unveils the Bat-Signal along with a note from Batman read by Harvey Dent, promising to defend Gotham whenever crime strikes again.double life dc comics dual identity chemical crime fighter fictional place superhero super power",False,tt0096895,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,411348924,0,0,10.752826400000002,-0.030070667040354673,,,,,55656281.9,80676281.9,,0,,,27516610.0,14.0,39516610.0,2.0,124000000.0,6.0,160000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,164816455.0,183316455.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,59204402.5,78329402.5,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29357676.0,46357676.0,1.0,,,,47110715.0,81777381.66666667,3.0,,,,-5067854.0,9932146.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,99758305.0,75758305.0,2.5,1.5,88766264.70698021

Soon afterward, he witnesses his parents' murder by mugger Joe Chill, leaving Bruce to be raised by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Years later, Chill is granted parole in exchange for testifying against crime boss Carmine Falcone. Bruce, now a young man, intends to shoot him, but one of Falcone's assassins does so first. Rachel Dawes, Bruce's childhood friend and now an assistant district attorney, is disgusted by his desire for vengeance. As a result Bruce confronts Falcone, who berates him. Bruce decides to travel and learn about the criminal underworld, before becoming a criminal himself. In a Bhutanese prison, Henri Ducard offers to train him in the arts of stealth and fear as a member of the League of Shadows, led by Ra's al Ghul. After completing his training, Bruce learns the League's true intention is to liberate Gotham by destroying it. Bruce refuses and burns down the League's temple. Ra's is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves an unconscious Ducard, leaving him with villagers. After meeting Alfred, Bruce returns to Gotham. Publicly posing as a playboy, he takes an interest in his family's company, Wayne Enterprises, a technology and defense conglomerate now run by the unscrupulous CEO William Earle. Bruce meets Lucius Fox, who introduces him to the company's prototype technologies, including an armored car and protective bodysuit. Taking these, Bruce finds an entrance to the cave under his well, confronts his fear of bats and creates a workshop, taking up the identity of ""Batman"". As Batman, he intercepts a drug shipment and provides Rachel with evidence to indict Falcone, empowering the honest Sgt. James Gordon and the Gotham police to arrest the previously untouchable Falcone. Meanwhile, a prototype water vaporizer is stolen from a Wayne Enterprises cargo ship. Back in Gotham, Falcone and his henchmen are declared mentally unfit for trial and transferred to Arkham Asylum by the corrupt Dr. Jonathan Crane, who had been using Falcone to import a dangerous hallucinogenic drug that causes severe psychosis. Crane exposes Falcone to the toxin while wearing a burlap mask, driving Falcone insane with fear of the ""Scarecrow."" While investigating Crane, Batman is also exposed to the drug and is rescued by Alfred and given an antidote by Fox. Rachel goes to Arkham, where Crane reveals that he has been dumping the toxin into Gotham's water supply before dosing her with it. She is rescued by Batman, who exposes Crane to the toxin and interrogates him. Crane reveals that the toxin is only dangerous if inhaled. Batman inoculates Rachel and gives her two vials of the antidote, one for Gordon and one for mass production. At his birthday celebration at Wayne Manor, Bruce is confronted by Ducard, who reveals himself to be the real Ra's al Ghul. Feigning drunkenness, Bruce kicks his guests out so they will be safe, leaving him alone with Ra's and his ninja. Ra's reveals the League's plan to destroy Gotham: having stolen the Microwave Emitter and conspired with Crane, they intend to vaporize the city's toxin-riddled water supply, creating mass hysteria and violence. The League sets fire to the mansion and Bruce is nearly trapped inside, but Alfred saves him at the last minute. As the League begins unleashing the toxin, Batman rescues Rachel from a drug-induced mob and reveals his true identity to her. He entrusts Gordon with the Tumbler and pursues Ra's, who is using Gotham's train system to deliver the weapon throughout the city. Batman confronts Ra's on the train and escapes just as Gordon uses the Tumbler to destroy the elevated tracks, leaving Ra's to die in the ensuing crash. Batman becomes a public hero, but simultaneously loses Rachel, who cannot bring herself to love both Bruce and Batman. Bruce buys a controlling stake in the now publicly traded Wayne Enterprises, fires Earle, and replaces him with Fox as the new CEO. Jim Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant, showing Batman the Bat-Signal and mentions a costumed criminal who leaves Joker playing cards at crime scenes. Batman promises to investigate this new criminal while disappearing into the night.loss of loved one martial arts dc comics crime fighter secret identity undercover vigilante superhero based on comic rivalry tragic hero ninja super power haunted by the past evil doctor master villain fighting crime unfulfilled love",False,tt0372784,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,374218673,1,0,1.4947911533333331,-2.6760407675788414,174868133.0,287368133.0,,,218264572.0,308264572.0,6444989.25,7,39194989.25,4.0,3428634.6,41.0,17828634.6,5.0,19502714.777777776,22.0,64891603.666666664,9.0,-1577515.0,5.0,33422485.0,1.0,184780640.6,19.0,233080640.6,5.0,36283660.0,3.0,43616993.333333336,3.0,-22129160.0,7.0,35370840.0,2.0,93354844.85714285,10.0,105430941.0,7.0,,,,151034768.0,242834768.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,352716856.5,425216856.5,2.0,42482.0,48482.0,1.0,541923061.8,642523061.8,5.0,108836497.6,185836497.6,5.0,231521297.5,316521297.5,4.0,44244700.0,50244700.0,1.0,,,,-3080347.0,1919653.0,1.0,228515735.7142857,300638592.85714287,7.0,,,,,,,109444383.5,144944383.5,2.0,42482.0,48482.0,1.0,28976270.0,96976270.0,1.0,-15430082.0,1569918.0,1.0,,,,-15430082.0,1569918.0,1.0,12298192.0,167298192.0,1.0,116070171.0,176070171.0,1.0,,,,22446856.0,34196856.0,2.0,,,71604640.93125,40011101.13561508,14.25,4.5,109858494.28372188

After being introduced to criminals Carl Showalter  and Gaear Grimsrud  by Native American ex-convict Shep Proudfoot , a mechanic at his dealership, Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota, and hires the two men to kidnap his wife Jean  in exchange for a new car and half of the 80,000 ransom. However, Jerry intends to demand a much larger sum from his wealthy father-in-law, Wade Gustafson , and keep most of the money for himself. GMAC has been threatening to withdraw loans for cars at the dealership Jerry manages after accounting irregularities. Jerry has been trying to raise money by promoting a real estate deal to Wade. Jerry tries to call off the kidnapping after Wade agrees to the investment, but he is too late, and, as it turns out, Wade intends to buy the property himself, giving Jerry only a finder's fee, which is not enough to pay off his debts. Carl and Gaear kidnap Jean, but on their way through Brainerd, a Minnesota State Patrol officer stops them because of the car's license plates. When Carl's attempt to bribe the trooper fails, Gaear kills the trooper. As Carl is moving the trooper's body off the road, he is seen by a couple passing by in their car. Gaear chases the couple, who lose control of their car and swerve off the road, enabling Gaear to kill them. The deaths are investigated by local police chief Marge Gunderson , who is seven months pregnant. She deduces the chain of events and follows the leads that arise, interviewing two prostitutes who serviced the criminals and tracing the license plates on their vehicle to Jerry's dealership. After being informed that the criminals telephoned Shep Proudfoot, she drives to Minneapolis, but acquires no information in interviews with Shep and Jerry. Jerry contacts Wade, saying that the kidnappers insist on dealing only with Jerry. Wade accepts this arrangement at first, but later changes his mind. When he meets with Carl at a parking garage, he refuses to give him the money until his daughter is returned. Angered by his demands and unexpected appearance, Carl shoots Wade. Before he dies, Wade shoots Carl in the face. Carl then kills the garage attendant on his way out. Jerry arrives at the scene just after Carl leaves. Later, Carl discovers that the bag he took from Wade contains a million dollars and buries most of the money by the side of the highway. At the hideout, Gaear has killed Jean, and, in a dispute over the car, he kills Carl with an axe. Before leaving town, Marge questions Jerry again, asking him about the car used in the Brainerd murders. When she asks to talk to Wade, Jerry storms out of the office, saying he will check the lot for the missing car but flees instead. Marge phones the state police to find and arrest him, then, following up on a tip, she drives to the lake, sees the kidnappers' car, and arrives just in time to see Gaear feeding the last of Carl's body into a wood chipper. Gaear tries to flee, but Marge shoots him in the leg and arrests him. Jerry is later arrested in a motel outside of Bismarck, North Dakota. Marge and her husband, Norm , sit in bed together discussing his artwork, which has been selected as the design for a postage stamp.cheating ransom salesclerk winter kidnapping unsociability police north dakota murder dark comedy money snow car dealership woodchipper car false history",False,tt0116282,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,60611975,1,0,7.658853571428572,-1.2635471289974909,102577807.375,127238807.375,35659145.571428575,47823145.571428575,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,-2846061.0,5.0,6153939.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,-2846061.0,6153939.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,-13953956.0,10546044.0,2.0,-13953956.0,10546044.0,2.0,,,,-2846061.0,6153939.0,1.0,,,,-13953956.0,10546044.0,2.0,,,,-2846061.0,6153939.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-13953956.0,10546044.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-179438.5,15820561.5,4.0,,,,,,,,,6153939.0,-2846061.0,0.625,1.0,56576255.24926193

Two vampires specialized in assassinating Lycans, Selene and Rigel, known as Death Dealers, track a pair of Lycans who are in their human form. Selene's motivation goes beyond duty; she also wants revenge because, about 600 years ago, a pack of Lycans slaughtered her family when she was a child. The vampires believe they defeated the werewolves many centuries ago and killed their leader, Lucian, and that they must kill off the survivors. As the vampires follow the Lycans into a subway station, the werewolves open fire with submachine guns and Rigel is killed. After the Lycans retreat from Selene's return fire and the arrival of a third Death Dealer, Nathaniel, she tracks them to their den. Nathaniel is slain by a Lycan named Raze after being ambushed. Upon reaching the Lycan den, Selene hears loud howling and learns that the Lycans have developed a new high-tech bullet to kill the vampires. When Selene arrives at the vampire coven's mansion, she recounts the evening's events and urges an attack on the Lycans, but the vampire regent, Kraven, tells her to drop the matter. Selene determines that the Lycans may have been following a human, Michael Corvin, and continues her investigation. In an underground Lycan lair, a scientist named Singe tests blood from kidnapped descendants of the ancient Corvinus family, trying to find a pure source of the ancient and powerful Corvinus bloodline. Soon after Selene finds Michael, the pair is attacked by six Lycans, including Lucian. After Lucian bites Michael, Selene helps Michael escape and the two become attracted to each other. Selene discovers that when Lucian was supposedly killed, Kraven was the only witness. Sensing a conspiracy, she wakes a powerful elder vampire, Viktor, who has been hibernating. Viktor is angered by his early awakening, as it was Markus' turn to rule, not his. Viktor believes Kraven and orders Selene to acquiesce to the vampire hierarchy. Kraven has secretly planned to kill the vampire elder, Amelia, and her companions, with Lucian's help. Selene tells Michael about the feud and her past. She then handcuffs him to a chair, fearing that he will kill innocent people after he changes at the full moon. Selene captures Singe while Michael is captured by two Lycans. Selene returns to the mansion with Singe, who admits to Viktor that the Lycans are trying to combine the bloodlines of the two species with the Corvinus Strain to create a powerful hybrid. After Kraven flees the mansion because Singe has revealed that Kraven and Lucian are working together, news arrives that Amelia, who was coming to awaken Markus, has been killed by Lycans. Viktor kills Singe in rage and gives Selene the chance to redeem herself by killing Michael. While Michael is being held captive, he learns that Viktor's daughter, Sonja, and Lucian became lovers. When Viktor learned that his daughter had been impregnated by a Lycan, he killed her to prevent any crossing of the species, which led to the war. Selene arrives with a group of Death Dealers to bring an end to the Lycans and kill Kraven for his treachery. Lucian prepares to fight, but Kraven shoots him with a newly designed bullet intended to kill by poisoning a Lycan's bloodstream. Selene rescues Michael as her allies battle the Lycans, but he is shot by Kraven. Kraven tells Selene it was Viktor who killed her family, and that he would have killed her if she had not reminded him of Sonja. When Selene still refuses to join Kraven, he points his gun at Michael to finish him off. Lucian emerges, injuring Kraven and telling Selene to bite Michael to transmit the vampire virus into his bloodstream. Selene complies and Kraven flees after killing Lucian. Viktor arrives and throws Selene against a wall and then throws Michael through a wall and into a pond below. Viktor admits that Kraven told the truth, but tells Selene that he gave her more than her human family ever could have: immortality. He also reveals the truth of his love for Sonja and that his choice to have her killed was to protect the vampires also stating that he would not have killed Michael if he could have avoided it, but that he must do it to protect his people. Viktor and the hybrid Michael fight, but Viktor gets the upper hand and attempts to strangle Michael. Selene grabs Viktor's sword and kills him with it.

His agent informs him that Capitol Pictures in Hollywood has offered a thousand dollars per week to write movie scripts. Barton hesitates, worried that moving to California would separate him from ""the common man"", his focus as a writer. He accepts the offer, however, and checks into the Hotel Earle, a large and unusually deserted building. His room is sparse and draped in subdued colors; its only decoration is a small painting of a woman on the beach, arm raised to block the sun. In his first meeting with Capitol Pictures boss Jack Lipnick ([[Michael Lerner , Barton explains that he chose the Earle because he wants lodging that is  ""less Hollywood"".Coen and Coen, p. 21. Lipnick promises that his only concern is Barton's writing ability, and assigns his new employee to a wrestling movie. Back in his room, however, Barton is unable to write. He is distracted by sounds coming from the room next door, and he phones the front desk to complain. His neighbor, Charlie Meadows  is the source of the noise and visits Barton to apologize, insisting on sharing some alcohol from a hip flask to make amends. As they talk, Barton proclaims his affection for ""the common man"", and Charlie describes his life as an insurance salesman. Later, Barton falls asleep, but is awoken by the incessant whine of a mosquito. Still unable to proceed beyond the first lines of his script, Barton consults producer Ben Geisler  for advice. Irritated, the frenetic Geisler takes him to lunch and orders him to speak with another writer for assistance. While in the bathroom, Barton meets the novelist William Preston  ""Bill"" Mayhew , who is vomiting in the next stall. They briefly discuss movie writing, and arrange a second meeting later in the day. When Barton arrives, Mayhew is drunk and yelling wildly. His secretary, Audrey Taylor , reschedules the meeting and confesses to Barton that she and Mayhew are in love. When they finally meet for lunch, Mayhew, Audrey, and Barton discuss writing and drinking. Before long Mayhew argues with Audrey, slaps her, and wanders off, drunk. Rejecting Barton's offer of consolation, she explains that she feels sorry for Mayhew, since he is married to another woman who is ""disturbed"".

Dazed, Barton wanders onto a beach, still carrying the package. He meets a woman who looks just like the one in the picture on his wall at the Earle, and she asks about the box. He tells her that he knows neither what it contains nor to whom it belongs. She assumes the pose from the picture.hotel screenplay movie business screenwriter cinema mass murder neighbor los angeles, california neo-noir 1940s",False,tt0101410,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,6153939,0,0,-0.4624779348641577,-4.754674342337864,4340939.5,8164939.5,,,82133092.5,93835592.5,,0,,,,0.0,,,19187653.0,7.0,27187653.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-10100000.0,5.0,5900000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-6083697.0,3916303.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,-1173477.0,2826523.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,16543826.5,4543826.5,1.5,1.0,43607562.87364688

Although Judgment Day did not occur on August 29, 1997, the date given by the Terminator in the previous film, John does not believe that the prophesied war between humans and Skynet has been averted. Unable to locate John, Skynet sends a new model of Terminator, the T-X , back in time to July 24, 2004 to kill his future lieutenants in the human Resistance. A more advanced model than previous Terminators, the T-X has an endoskeleton with built-in weaponry, a liquid metal exterior similar to the T-1000, and the ability to control other machines. The Resistance sends a reprogrammed T-850 model 101 Terminator  back in time to protect the T-X's targets, including Kate Brewster  and John. The Terminator saves John and Kate from the T-X's initial attack, and the three visit the grave of Sarah Connor, who died of leukemia some years before. Inside the grave they find a weapons cache left by Sarah's friends as a backup in the event that Judgment Day was not averted. The T-X and police arrive and a battle ensues, but John, Kate, and the Terminator steal a hearse and escape. The Terminator has been programmed to take John and Kate to a safe location so that they may survive Judgment Day, which is to occur in a few hours, but John decides that they should attempt to prevent Skynet from being activated. The Terminator reveals that, in the future, John and Kate had married, and that Kate had reprogrammed him and sent him back in time after it had succeeded in killing John in 2032. After the destruction of Cyberdyne Systems in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the United States Air Force took over the Skynet project and it is being headed by Kate's father, Lieutenant General Robert Brewster ([[David Andrews . However, the trio arrive too late to stop him from activating Skynet in an attempt to stop the spread of a massive computer virus. Skynet assumes control of the military's defense network just as the T-X arrives, taking control of various machines in an attempt to eliminate John and Kate. John asks the dying General for the location of Skynet's system core, hoping to still stop Judgment Day, and is instructed to go to Crystal Peak, a military base built into the Sierra Nevada mountains. Before John and Kate can escape by plane, the T-X takes control of the Terminator and it attacks them. It is able to override its programming and shut itself down before it can kill John. As John and Kate arrive at Crystal Peak they are attacked by the T-X, but a rebooted Terminator crashes a helicopter into it. Even with its legs severed the T-X continues to pursue John and Kate, but the Terminator traps it under a blast door and detonates its last remaining hydrogen fuel cell in the T-X's mouth, destroying them both. John and Kate discover that Crystal Peak does not house Skynet's core, but is rather a Cold War-era fallout shelter for high-ranking government officials. General Brewster sent them there to protect them from the impending nuclear holocaust initiated by Skynet. Skynet in fact does not have a core but instead exists as software in cyberspace running on computers all over the world, making it effectively impossible to shut down. It begins a series of nuclear attacks on various cities, commencing Judgment Day. Soon after the attacks, the equipment at Crystal Peak picks up transmissions from amateur radio operators and Montana's civil defense, to which John responds.saving the world artificial intelligence man vs machine cyborg killer robot leather jacket nanotechnology rocket launcher veterinarian fire engine dystopia psychiatrist firefighter",False,tt0181852,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,435000000,0,0,1.175,-14.415123713336484,25516619.7,35421619.7,-5974559.0,24712941.0,,,92589161.0,19,158289161.0,2.0,-718176.0,2.0,1381824.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,3000000.0,3.0,5000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,71971200.0,19.0,78371200.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,69984862.0,102984862.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,112441833.5,179441833.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,67006296.0,112006296.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,71971200.0,78371200.0,60760546.25,41710546.25,5.375,1.25,79569518.43496008

Sarah's publisher, John Bosload , offers her his country house near Lacoste, France for some rest and relaxation. After becoming comfortable with the run of the house, Sarah's quietude is disrupted by a young woman claiming to be the publisher's daughter, Julie . She shows up one night claiming to be taking time off from work herself. She also claims that her mother used to be Bosload's mistress, but that he would not leave his family. Julie's sex life consists of one-night stands with various oafish men, and a competition of personalities develops between the two women. At first Sarah regards Julie as a distraction from her writing. She uses earplugs to allow her to sleep during Julie's noisy nighttime adventures, although she nonetheless has a voyeuristic fascination with them. Later she abandons the earplugs during one of Julie's trysts, beginning to envy Julie's lifestyle. The competition comes to the fore when a local waiter, Franck , is involved. Julie wants him but he appears to prefer the more mature Sarah, having struck up a relationship with her during her frequent lunches at the bistro. An unexpected tragedy occurs after a night of flirting among the three. After swimming together in the pool, Franck refuses to allow Julie to continue performing oral sex on him, once Sarah, who watches them from the balcony, throws a rock into the water. Franck feels frightened and tells Julie he is leaving. The next day, Franck is missing. While investigating Franck's disappearance, Sarah learns that Julie's mother has been dead for some time, though Julie had claimed that she was still alive. She returns to the villa, where a confused Julie thinks that Sarah is her mother and has a breakdown. She eventually recovers and confesses that Franck is dead because Julie repeatedly hit him over the head with a rock as he tried to leave her at the pool. His body is in one of the sheds. When Marcel  becomes suspicious of the mound of fresh soil where the body is buried, Sarah seduces the elderly gardener to distract him. Julie leaves, thanking Sarah for her help and leaving her the manuscript of an unpublished novel written by her late mother, which she had previously claimed that John made her burn. Sarah returns to England and visits her publisher's office with her new novel. His daughter also shows up just as Sarah is leaving, but is revealed to be a completely different girl than the one Sarah spent the weekend with.london, england countryside based on novel or book subway provence country house writing innkeeper generations conflict dying and death daughter swimming pool murder author drugs",False,tt0324133,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,22441323,1,0,1.8770926923076925,-14.415123713336484,,,40515982.0,43515982.0,,,28049560.0,2,143049560.0,1.0,,0.0,,,35095937.0,11.0,62429270.333333336,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-20703562.0,14296438.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,102739415.16666667,31572748.5,1.625,2.0,79569518.43496008

She has been informed about her daughter's death a few hours before Alex's visit, but does not show any signs of grief. However, she has a cleanliness mania which involves her constantly making sure everything in her home is neat, and prevents her from touching garbage bags. Her problem is finding someone who will put the garbage outside to be collected, as this was always something done by her daughter.

Helmut Grokenberger , a mild East German immigrant who was once a clown in his home country, now works in New York as a taxi driver. He picks up a passenger named YoYo , a brash, streetwise young man and attempts to drive him to Brooklyn. Helmut doesn't really know how to drive with an automatic transmission so he allows YoYo to drive. On their way, they pick up YoYo's argumentative sister-in-law Angela . The story revolves around Helmut's attempts to understand and become a part of the culture of New York.  A blind woman  goes for a ride at night with a driver . The driver asks his passenger what it's like to be blind and she attempts to explain to him, but their differences of life experience make things difficult. After he drops off his blind passenger, he feels fascinated by her and gazes in her direction. This inattention to driving causes him to crash into another car, whose driver angrily accuses him of being blind. An ironic twist at the end of the segment turns upon a French pun near the beginning of it: When the driver states his nationality as ""Ivoirien,"" some other Africans mock him with the punning phrase ""Y voit rien"" .  In the wee morning hours, a very eccentric cabbie  picks up a priest . As he drives, he starts to confess his sins. Much to the priest's discomfort, he goes into great detail about how he discovered his sexuality first with a pumpkin and then with a sheep, then details a love affair he had with his brother's wife. The already-ailing priest is shocked by the lurid confession, and promptly has a fatal heart attack, leaving the cabbie with a very troubling situation.  After an evening spent drinking heavily, three workers, one of whom has just been laid off , climb into a cab to return home. On the way, the workers talk about what an awful fix their now-unconscious friend is in, by being out of work and having to face a divorce and a pregnant daughter. The driver, Mika , then tells them all the saddest story they have ever heard. The workers are terribly moved and depressed by the story, and even become unsympathetic toward their drunken, laid-off companion. As they arrive home, the sun is beginning to rise on a new day.paris, france new york city taxi megacity rome italy pastor taxi driver passenger night life casual meeting metropolis german democratic republic casting agent heart attack helsinki night conflict los angeles, california city episodic finland road movie understanding",True,tt0102536,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,2015810,0,0,-0.7362747481161419,-4.754674342337864,1013284.0,2316766.0,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,1554476.0,1.0,2554476.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2554476.0,1554476.0,0.125,1.0,43607562.87364688

Bill meets an old friend from med school, Nick Nightingale , who now plays piano professionally. While a Hungarian man tries to pick up Alice, two young models try to take Bill off for a tryst. He is interrupted by a call from his host upstairs, who had been having sex with a young woman who has overdosed on a speedball. Next evening at home, while smoking marijuana, Bill's wife asks him if he had sex with the two girls. After Bill reassures her, she asks if he is ever jealous of men who are attracted to her. As the discussion gets heated, he states that he thinks women are more faithful than men. She rebuts him, telling him of a recent fantasy she had about a naval officer they had encountered on a vacation. Disturbed by Alice's revelation, Bill is just then called to the deathbed of the father of a now-engaged female friend, who impulsively kisses him and tells him she loves him. Putting her off, Bill takes a walk and meets a prostitute named Domino , and goes to her apartment. His wife phones as he begins to kiss her, after which he calls off the awkward encounter. Meeting his friend Nick at the Sonata Cafe, Bill learns that Nick has a following engagement where he must play piano blindfolded. Nick tells him about beautiful women he glimpsed when the blindfold slipped at the last gig for this customer, allowing him to surmise some of the goings-on. Bill presses for details. To gain admittance, one needs a costume, a mask and the password. Bill drives late at night to a shop called ""Rainbow Fashions"", whose previous owner he knew. He offers the new owner, Mr. Milich , a generous amount of money to rent to him now. Searching for a costume, the owner catches his teenage daughter  with two Japanese men and expresses outrage at their lack of sense of decency, and threatens to call the police. Bill now takes a taxi out to a country mansion where a quasi-religious sexual ritual is taking place. One woman takes Bill aside and warns him he does not belong there. Bill then with another girl walks through a few rooms where an orgy is taking place. The first woman catches up with Bill and insists he is in terrible danger for they suspect that he is an outsider. Bill is then interrupted by a masked porter who tells him that the taxi driver who is waiting outside wants to speak with him. However, the porter takes him to the main room where the masked, red-cloaked Master of Ceremonies confronts Bill with a question about a second password which Bill is unable to answer. The Master of Ceremonies insists that he ""kindly remove his mask"", then asks that he remove his clothes. The masked young woman who had tried to warn Bill now intervenes and insists that she be punished instead of him. As she is taken away, Bill asks what is going to happen to her. The Master cryptically replies her fate is sealed and Bill is ushered from the mansion and warned not to tell anyone about what happened there. Just before dawn, Bill arrives home guilty and confused, where his wife Alice is now awake and tells him of a troubling dream in which he and she were in a deserted city without their clothes. She felt frightened and ashamed while he went off to try to find their clothes. She then felt better, finding herself, still naked, in a beautiful garden. The Naval Officer emerged, stared at her, and the two of them began making love surrounded by many other couples doing the same. She then started having sex with many of those men and laughing at the idea of Bill seeing her with them. Next morning Bill finds Nick's hotel from the waitress in the next-door cafe; the desk clerk  tells Bill that a bruised and frightened Nick checked out a few hours earlier after returning with two large, dangerous-looking men. Nick tried to pass an envelope to him when they were leaving, but it was intercepted, then he was driven away by the two men in a limousine. Bill goes to return the costume and the shop owner, with his daughter by his side, states he can do other favors for Bill ""and it needn't be a costume"". The Japanese men leave; Milich implies to Bill that he has sold his daughter for prostitution. Bill has misplaced the mask, so is billed for it. Bill returns to the mansion in his own car and is greeted at the gate by a man with a note warning him to cease and desist his inquiries. At home, Bill thinks about Alice's dream while he watches her tutor their daughter. That evening, Bill goes to the home of the prostitute with a gift. Her roommate greets him, telling him Domino has just discovered she has HIV. Bill leaves and notices a well-dressed man is following him. After losing him, Bill reads a newspaper story about a beauty queen, Amanda Curran, who had died of a drug overdose. She is the Mandy he had treated at Ziegler's party. He goes to the hospital, claiming to be her doctor, and examines her body in the morgue. Ziegler summons Bill to his house and tells him he knows all the events of the past night and day. Ziegler was one of those involved with the ritual orgy and his own position with the secret society has been jeopardized by Bill's intrusion. Bill asks about the death of Mandy, whom Ziegler has identified as the woman at the party who'd ""sacrificed"" herself to prevent Bill's punishment, and about Nick. Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at home in Seattle, but does not know where to contact him. Ziegler also insists that the ""punishment"" had nothing to do with Mandy's death; she was a junkie and she has died from another accidental drug overdose. Bill does not know if Ziegler is telling him the truth, but says nothing further. When Bill returns home, he sees the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife. He breaks down in tears and as Alice awakes, he decides to tell her the whole truth of the past two days. The next morning they go Christmas shopping. His wife muses that recent events do not define their life and they should be grateful they have survived and are still together and that she loves him. She then says they need to, in her own words, ""fuck"" as soon as possible.  Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella Dream Story is set around Vienna shortly after the turn of the century. The couple are named Fridolin and Albertina, and their home is a typical suburban middle-class home, not the film's posh urban apartment. Schnitzler himself, like the protagonist of this novel, lived in Vienna, was Jewish, and a medical doctor . The couple in the novella are implied to be Jewish . According to historian Geoffrey Cocks, Kubrick  frequently removed references to the Jewishness of characters in the novels he adapted. This is reflected in the way the film handles the way Bill Harford is taunted by college students when going home in the morning. In the film, Bill is taunted with homophobic slurs. In the novella, these boys are recognized to be members of an anti-Semitic college fraternity.Peter Loewenberg notes this in his essay Freud Schnitzler and Eyes Wide Shut http://books.google.com/books?idPA268&dq1#vfalse as does Geoffrey Cocks in his book Wolf at the Door  The novella is set during Carnival, when people often wear masks to parties. The party that both husband and wife attend at the opening of the story is a masked Carnival ball, whereas the film's story begins at Christmas time. Critic Randy Rasmussen suggests that the character of Bill is fundamentally more naïve, strait-laced, less disclosing and more unconscious of his vindictive motives than his counterpart, Fridolin.{{Harvnb|Rasmussen|2005|p6Y7FnTDmvUIC&pgFidelio+Denmark+Kubrick&cdfalse] The party in the novella consists mostly of nude ballroom dancing. In the novella the woman who ""redeems"" Fridolin at the party, saving him from punishment, is costumed as a nun, and most of the characters at the party are dressed as nuns or priests; Fridolin himself used a priest costume. This aspect was retained in the film's original screenplay,Eyes Wide Shut original screenplay but was deleted in the filmed version. In the novella, when the husband returns home, the wife's dream is an elaborate drama that concludes with him getting crucified in a village square after Fridolin refuses to separate from Albertina and become the paramour of the village princess, even though Albertina is now occupied with copulating with other men, and watches him ""without pity"". By being faithful, Fridolin thus fails to save himself from execution in Albertina's dream although he was apparently spared by the woman's 'sacrifice' at the masked sex party. In both the novella and film, the wife states that the laugh in her sleep just before she woke was a laugh of scornful contempt for her husband; although awake she states this matter-of-factly. The novella makes it clear that Fridolin at this point hates Albertina more than ever, thinking they are now lying together ""like mortal enemies"". It has been argued that the dramatic climax of the novella is actually Albertina's dream, and the film has shifted the focus to Bill's visit to the secret society's orgy whose content is more shocking in the film.Rainer J. Kaus, Notes on Eyes Wide Shut The character of Ziegler  is entirely an invention of the film, having no counterpart in Schnitzler. Critic Randy Rasmussen interprets Ziegler as representing Bill's worst self, much as in other Kubrick films; the title character in Dr. Strangelove represents the worst of the American national security establishment, Charles Grady represents the worst of Jack Torrance in The Shining, and Clare Quilty represents the worst of Humbert Humbert in Lolita.{{Harvnb}} The novella explains why the husband's mask is on the pillow next to his sleeping wife, she having discovered it when it slipped out of his suitcase, and placing it there as a statement of understanding. This is left unexplained in the film.life and death sexual obsession prostitute christmas party eroticism orgy masked ball marijuana mansion illegal prostitution",False,tt0120663,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,162091208,1,0,1.4937108923076925,15.965307217698705,,,43028838.0,57528838.0,,,-8997888.0,14,15502112.0,1.0,118906829.0,4.0,178906829.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,615787.0,3.0,1615787.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22874091.85714286,32159806.14285714,7.0,,,,,,,21379790.333333332,37046457.0,3.0,25478107.166666668,35978107.166666664,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,12491080.0,16491080.0,1.0,,,,22874091.85714286,32159806.14285714,7.0,,,,18793826.5,28793826.5,2.0,-9398868.5,16601131.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,65341576.0,36841576.0,2.625,1.3333333333333333,73407251.10798967

Upon receiving a transmission of unknown origin from a nearby planetoid, the ship's computer awakens the crew.In the script and film the computer is referred to by the crew members as ""Mother"". An October 1979 issue of Fantastic Films magazine, as well as the back of the 1980 Fox videodisk of the film, explain that ""Mother"" is an abbreviation for ""MU/TH/UR 6000"", the model of the computer. The chapter list for Alien in the 2003 Alien Quadrilogy DVD set also lists it as ""MU/TH/UR"". The 1997 sequel Alien Resurrection, the fourth film in the series, echoed this element by having the crew of the Auriga refer to the ship's onboard computer as ""Father."" McIntee, 25, 119. Acting on standing orders from their corporate employers, the crew detaches the Nostromo from the refinery and lands on the planetoid, resulting in some damage to the ship. Captain Dallas , Executive Officer Kane , and Navigator Lambert  set out to investigate the signal's source while Warrant Officer Ripley , Science Officer Ash , and Engineers Brett  and Parker  stay behind to monitor their progress and make repairs. Dallas, Kane, and Lambert discover that the signal is coming from a derelict alien spacecraft. Inside it they find the remains of a large alien creature whose ribs appear to have been forced outward from the inside. Meanwhile, the Nostromo's computer partially deciphers the signal transmission, which Ripley determines to be some type of warning. Kane discovers a vast chamber containing numerous eggs, one of which releases a creature that attaches itself to his face. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo, where Ash allows them inside against Ripley's orders to follow the ship's quarantine protocol. They unsuccessfully attempt to remove the creature from Kane's face, discovering that its blood is an extremely corrosive acid. Eventually the creature detaches on its own and is found dead. With the ship repaired, the crew resume their trip back to Earth. Kane awakens seemingly unharmed, but during a meal before re-entering stasis he begins to choke and convulse until an alien creature bursts from his chest, killing him and escaping into the ship. Lacking conventional weapons, the crew attempt to locate and capture the creature by fashioning motion trackers, electric prods, and flamethrowers. Brett follows the crew's cat into a large room where the now-fully-grown Alien attacks him and disappears with his body into the ship's air shafts. Dallas enters the shafts intending to force the Alien into an airlock where it can be expelled into space, but it ambushes him. Lambert implores the remaining crew members to escape in the ship's shuttle, but Ripley, now in command, explains that the shuttle will not support four people. Accessing the ship's computer, Ripley discovers that Ash has been ordered to return the Alien to the Nostromo's corporate employers even at the expense of the crew's lives. Ash attacks her, but Parker intervenes and decapitates him with a blow from a fire extinguisher, revealing Ash to be an android. Before Parker incinerates him, Ash predicts that the other crew members will not survive. The remaining three crew members plan to arm the Nostromo's self-destruct mechanism and escape in the shuttle, but Parker and Lambert are killed by the Alien while gathering the necessary supplies. Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence and heads for the shuttle with the cat, but finds the Alien blocking her way. She unsuccessfully attempts to abort the self-destruct, then returns to find the Alien gone and narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the Nostromo explodes. As she prepares to enter stasis, Ripley discovers that the Alien is aboard the shuttle. She puts on a space suit and opens the hatch, causing explosive decompression which forces the Alien to the open doorway. She shoots it with a grappling gun which propels it out, but the gun is yanked from her hands and catches in the closing door, tethering the Alien to the shuttle. It attempts to crawl into one of the engines, but Ripley activates them and blasts the Alien into space. She then puts herself and the cat into stasis for the return trip to Earth.android spacecraft countdown space marine space suit beheading space travel dystopia biology cowardice space alien female protagonist cult film parasite space opera h. r. giger cosmos xenomorph",False,tt0078748,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,104931801,1,0,8.539254636363637,13.40232829350162,,,58512574.75,68691324.75,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,13581884.0,13.0,16031884.0,2.0,-1500000.0,3.0,4500000.0,2.0,154777836.0,6.0,161777836.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,32561490.0,39961490.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3000000.0,8000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,2713768.0,3713768.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,16694500.0,23294500.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,27833201.0,33833201.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,35216084.0,47121084.0,3.0,,,60769906.666666664,55619906.666666664,2.75,1.6666666666666667,97294213.31047031

Thirty-three years later, the child, Oswald Cobblepot , resurfaces as a criminal, the Penguin, who kidnaps millionaire industrialist and business tycoon Max Shreck . With evidence of his corporate crimes, Cobblepot blackmails Shreck into helping him leave the sewers to become part of Gotham's elite. The Penguin arranges for the Mayor's child to be kidnapped, whom he then ""rescues"" in order to set himself up as a heroic figure. Max Shreck later pushes his secretary, Selina Kyle , out of a window from his company's building after she discovers that his proposed power station for Gotham actually will drain electricity from the city. Selina survives the fall, but it causes a psychotic break and her personality changes. Having an affinity for cats, Selina returns home and designs a costume, becoming Catwoman and focusing on revenge against her boss. Shreck then hatches a plan to recall Gotham City's current mayor ([[Michael Murphy  and elect Cobblepot in his place, in order to cement his control over the city and complete his power plant project. The Penguin's gang of circus performers cause chaos around Gotham to reduce the popularity of the Mayor. Meanwhile, Batman  continues to have confrontations with Catwoman as well as the Penguin's gang. Selina, meanwhile, falls in love with Batman's alter-ego Bruce Wayne, a situation complicated by Catwoman's teaming with the Penguin in an effort to rid Gotham of Batman. They kidnap the Ice Princess , a woman chosen to turn on the Gotham Christmas Tree lights, and frame Batman for the crime. Batman finds her tied up in a nearby building. He learns that the Penguin kidnapped her, but Catwoman then takes her to the top of the building. The Penguin causes the woman to fall off the building, killing her, with a crowd seeing Batman and believing that he killed her. Catwoman is upset because she did not intend to kill the Princess, and then rejects the Penguin's advances on her, whereupon the Penguin tries to kill her. In the midst of Batman's attempt at rescuing the Ice Princess, the Penguin's henchmen sabotage the Batmobile. When Batman returns to the Batmobile, the Penguin takes control of it and wreaks havoc on the streets of Gotham City until Batman manages to disable the Penguin's control while recording the Penguin's taunts about framing Batman and fooling the city. When Bruce exposes the Penguin's villainous ways, thereby ruining his election chances, the Penguin initiates a plan to kidnap all of Gotham's first-born infants. He personally attempts to take Max's son, Charles ""Chip"" Shreck , but agrees to take Max instead. Batman foils the Penguin's kidnapping scheme, whereupon the Penguin then decides to launch missiles around Gotham using mind-controlled penguins. However, Batman is able to jam the frequency used to control the penguins and has missiles launched at the Penguin's base. Batman confronts the Penguin, which culminates in the Penguin falling into the toxic waters in his lair. Batman tries persuading Catwoman to turn Shreck over to the police, even unmasking himself in the process, but Shreck draws a gun. Catwoman claims that she still has six of her nine lives remaining, and stays standing up after Shreck fires his gun at her four times. Catwoman uses a taser to cause an explosion, electrocuting Shreck and apparently sacrificing herself . The Penguin then emerges from the toxic water and tries to kill Batman, but he succumbs to his wounds. His body is taken by his penguins into the sewer waters as a final resting place. Later, Bruce is being driven around the city at night with butler Alfred Pennyworth  and thinks he sees Selina's shadow on a wall. Alfred stops the car, and Bruce finds a cat, which he takes with him and leaves. As the Bat-Signal lights up the night sky, a silhouette of what appears to be Catwoman is seen gazing at it.holiday corruption double life dc comics crime fighter fictional place hallucination christmas tree vigilante superhero violence dark hero super power super villain deformed bird cage evil circus christmas",False,tt0103776,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,280000000,0,0,2.5,2.6736984935700776,191719629.0,212613629.0,75832235.58333333,101682235.58333333,,,376348924.0,3,411348924.0,1.0,,0.0,,,20670720.0,4.0,34670720.0,1.0,38975522.25,14.0,51725522.25,4.0,376348924.0,3.0,411348924.0,1.0,-3000000.0,6.0,1500000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,376348924.0,411348924.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,376348924.0,411348924.0,1.0,,,,376348924.0,411348924.0,1.0,376348924.0,411348924.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,376348924.0,411348924.0,182118818.05,161868818.05,3.75,1.6,96568078.59273516

Vianne opens a Chocolaterie just as the villagers begin observing the forty days of Lent, much to the chagrin of Reynaud. Vianne, who wears more provocative clothing, does not go to church, and has an illegitimate child, does not fit in well with the town's people, but is nevertheless optimistic about her business. Her friendly and alluring nature begins to win the villagers over one by one, causing Reynaud to openly speak against her for tempting the people during a time of abstinence and self-denial. One of the first to fall under the spell of Vianne and her confections is Armande , her elderly, eccentric landlady. Armande laments that her cold, devoutly-pious daughter Caroline  will not let Armande see her grandson Luc because Caroline thinks Armande is a ""bad influence"". Vianne arranges for Luc and his grandmother to see each other in the chocolaterie, where they develop a close bond. Caroline later reveals to Vianne that her mother is a diabetic, though Armande continues to indulge in the chocolate despite her condition. Vianne also develops a friendship with a disturbed woman, Josephine , who is a victim of brutal beatings by her alcoholic husband Serge . After a particularly brutal blow to the head, Josephine leaves her husband and moves in with Vianne and Anouk. As she begins to work at the chocolaterie and Vianne teaches her craft, Josephine becomes a self-confident, changed woman. Under the instruction of Reynaud, Serge seemingly changes into a better man and he asks Josephine to come back to him. Finally happy and fulfilled, Josephine declines. A drunken Serge breaks into the chocolaterie later that night and attempts to attack both women before Josephine, in a moment of empowerment, knocks him out with a skillet. As the rivalry between Vianne and Reynaud worsens, a band of river gypsies camp out on the outskirts of the village. While most of the town objects to their presence, Vianne embraces them, developing a mutual attraction to the gypsy Roux . Together they hold a birthday party for Armande with other village members and gypsies on Roux's boat. When Caroline sees Luc, who snuck out to go to the party, dancing with her mother, she begins to see how rigid she is with her son and that his grandmother's influence in his life may not be a bad thing. After the party Vianne, Josephine, and Anouk all sleep on the boats, where Roux and Vianne make love. Late that night, Serge sets the boat on fire where Josephine and Anouk are sleeping. Both escape unharmed, but Vianne's faith in the village is shaken. Also that night, Luc returns to his grandmother's living room to see that she has finally died from complications of diabetes, devastating both him and his mother. After the fire, Roux packs up and leaves with his group, much to Vianne's sadness. Deciding she cannot win against Reynaud or the strict traditions of the town, Vianne resolves to move to another place. Just before she does so, she goes into her kitchen to see a group of townspeople who have come to love her and the way she has changed their lives, making chocolate for a festival Vianne had planned on Easter Sunday. Realizing that she has brought change to the town, she decides to stay. Despite the shifting sentiment in the town, Reynaud remains staunch in his abstinence from pleasures such as chocolate. On the Saturday evening before Easter, he opens the chocolate display and destroys the various confections with a knife. When a small piece of chocolate lands on his lip, he gives into the seduction and devours the chocolate before collapsing into tears and eventually falling asleep. The next day, Vianne promises not to reveal what happened, and a mutual respect between them is established. Roux returns in the summer to be with her, and despite her constant need for change, Vianne resolves to stay, having found a home for herself and her daughter in the village.france chocolate parent child relationship mayor praline single town",False,tt0241303,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,152500343,0,0,5.10001372,-1.1627692044360227,,,61673433.375,80011625.625,,,204976425.0,4,231976425.0,1.0,,0.0,,,132530565.0,14.0,138530565.0,1.0,142172523.0,11.0,168172523.0,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-8224415.0,7.0,3275585.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3958629.0,7458629.0,2.0,-4835596.0,5164404.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,28363635.0,39363635.0,1.0,,,,17966644.0,20966644.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,54993712.0,62493712.0,1.0,,,,85991436.4,113991436.4,5.0,,,,13522328.57142857,36286614.28571428,14.0,,,135488774.5,117863774.5,4.5,1.75,76394553.2193505

Wealthy industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland  assembles a team of scientists to investigate the heat source and claim it for his multinational communications company, Weyland Industries. The team includes archaeologists, linguistic experts, drillers, mercenaries, and a guide named Alexa Woods . As a Predator ship reaches Earth's orbit, it blasts a shaft through the ice towards the source of the heat bloom. When the humans arrive at the site above the heat source, an abandoned whaling station, they find the shaft and descend beneath the ice. They discover a mysterious pyramid and begin to explore it, finding evidence of a civilization predating written history and what appears to be a sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons with ruptured rib cages. Meanwhile, three Predators land and kill the humans on the surface, making their way down to the pyramid and arriving just as the team unwittingly powers up the structure. An Alien queen awakes from cryogenic stasis and begins to produce eggs, from which facehuggers hatch and attach to several humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber. Chestbursters emerge from the humans and quickly grow into adult Aliens. Conflicts erupt between the Predators, Aliens, and humans, resulting in several deaths. Unbeknownst to the others, a Predator is implanted with an Alien embryo. Through translation of the pyramid's hieroglyphs the explorers learn that the Predators have been visiting Earth for thousands of years. It was they who taught early human civilizations how to build pyramids, and were worshipped as gods. Every 100 years they would visit Earth to take part in a rite of passage in which several humans would sacrifice themselves as hosts for the Aliens, creating the ""ultimate prey"" for the Predators to hunt. If overwhelmed, the Predators would activate their self-destruct weapons to eliminate the Aliens and themselves. The explorers deduce that this is why the current Predators are at the pyramid, and that the heat bloom was to attract humans for the purpose of making new Aliens to hunt. The remaining humans decide that the Predators must be allowed to succeed in their hunt so that the Aliens do not reach the surface. As the battle continues most of the characters are killed, leaving only Alexa and a single Predator to fight against the Aliens. The two form an alliance and use the Predator’s self-destruct device to destroy the pyramid and the remaining Aliens. Alexa and the Predator reach the surface, where they battle the escaped Alien queen. They defeat the queen by attaching its chain to a water tower and pushing it over a cliff into the water, dragging the queen to the ocean floor. The Predator, however, dies from its wounds. A Predator ship uncloaks and several Predators appear. They collect their fallen comrade and present Alexa with one of their spear weapons in recognition of her skill as a warrior. As they retreat into space, a chestburster erupts from the dead Predator. It appears to be an Alien/Predator hybrid with the characteristic mandibles of both creatures.saving the world predator space marine pyramid praise alien cosmos 21st century xenomorph",True,tt0370263,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,171183863,1,0,1.4454837571428572,1.9257596443831189,,,18329052.0,64829052.0,-37821105.0,72178895.0,,0,,,,0.0,,,46740365.5,8.0,94740365.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18329052.0,64829052.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,101852673.0,132352673.0,2.0,,,,69984862.0,102984862.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,-37821105.0,72178895.0,1.0,69984862.0,102984862.0,1.0,39558115.0,74558115.0,1.0,69984862.0,102984862.0,1.0,,,,,,,200000000.0,280000000.0,1.0,69984862.0,102984862.0,1.0,101265204.0,179265204.0,1.0,39558115.0,74558115.0,1.0,,,94740365.5,46740365.5,1.0,2.0,84824632.31357588

The patient is reluctant to disclose any personal information but through a series of flashbacks, viewers are allowed into his past. It is slowly revealed that he is in fact a Hungarian cartographer, Count László de Almásy, who was making a map of the Sahara Desert, and whose affair with a married woman, Katharine Clifton , ultimately brought about his present situation. As the patient remembers more, David Caravaggio , a Canadian intelligence operative and former thief, arrives at the monastery. Caravaggio lost his thumbs while being interrogated by a German army officer, and he gradually reveals that it was the patient's actions that had brought about his torture. In addition to the patient's story, the film devotes time to Hana and her romance with Kip , an Indian Sikh sapper in the British Army. Due to various events in her past, Hana believes that anyone who comes close to her is likely to die, and Kip's position as a bomb defuser makes their romance full of tension. In the first phase, set in the late 1930s, the minor Hungarian noble Count Laszlo de Almásy  is co-leader of a Royal Geographical Society archeological and surveying expedition in Egypt and Libya. He and his English partner Madox are at heart academics with limited sophistication in the swirling politics of Europe and North Africa. Shortly after the film begins, both the morale and finances of their expedition are bolstered by a British couple, Geoffrey and Katherine Clifton  that joins the exploration party. The Count is taken with the gorgeous and refined Katherine. When Geoffrey is often away from the group on other matters, an affair takes wing. The final months before the war's onset bring an archeological triumph: the Count's discovery of an ancient Saharan cave decorated with ""swimming figure"" paintings dating from prehistoric times, the ""Cave of Swimmers"". This period also sees the romance between Katherine and the Count rise to a sensuous peak and then seemingly fade. Katherine is plagued with the guilt of infidelity, while the Count shows a streak of jealousy along with an imbalance that will later haunt him. The fall of 1939 and the war bring all excavation at the cave to a halt, and Madox and the Count go their separate ways. Geoffrey Clifton meanwhile has pieced together the outline of the affair, and seeks a sudden and dramatic revenge: crashing his plane, with Katherine aboard, into the Count's desert camp. The wreck kills Geoffrey instantly, seriously injures Katherine, and narrowly misses the Count. He manages to take Katherine into the relative shelter of the swimming figure cave, leaves her with food, water, a flashlight, and a fire, then begins his scorching three day walk back to the nearest town and help. The town is held by the British Army, and the dazed and dehydrated Count, with his non-English name, is unable to coherently explain to officials the plane crash and Katherine's plight. Instead he loses his temper during questioning and is thrown into military jail. He is sent in chains on a train ""north to Benghazi"", escapes, finds himself behind Afrika Korps lines and quickly trades his desert maps with the Germans for petrol for Madox's biplane, a De Havilland Tiger Moth, which he had left behind at the close of their archaeological expedition. By the time he returns to the cave, Katherine is dead – and in all but a physical sense, so is the Count. He manages to bundle Katherine's body into the plane and takes off. Mistaking the Tiger Moth for an RAF reconnaissance aircraft, a German anti-aircraft battery shoots down the plane as Almásy pilots it over the desert. Horribly burned but alive, he is rescued by Bedouin tribesmen. The film's second phase shifts to Italy and the last months of the war. The Count by now is an invalid patient, and wholly dependent by this time on morphine and the care of his French-Canadian nurse Hana, detached from her medical unit and established in a battered but beautiful Italian monastery. That place becomes the focal point for more plot threads, some new and some unfinished from the North African phase, all themed around love, chance, and the backdrop of the war. Hana has seen a fiancé and a nursing friend die in the Italian campaign, and is left to wonder if her involvement with a British-Indian lieutenant will break her cycle of love and grief or simply continue it. A visitor to the villa named Caravaggio is in search for the disfigured Count that he believes played a role in his own ill-starred time in Egypt and Libya. For Caravaggio unwittingly stumbled into the wreckage of the Count-Katherine-Geoffrey love triangle, circa 1940–42. He's lost both thumbs in a grisly interrogation at the hands of the Nazis, and has since hunted down and killed those he believes responsible for his fate. He believes the Count was part of a web of desert spying and intrigue, and knows that he traded maps with the Germans. He confronts him with news of Madox's suicide, and posits that the Count killed the Cliftons. Only a full recounting at the villa of the Cliftons' crash and the Count's map dealings with the Germans to recover Katherine bring Caravaggio to understanding and forgiveness. Hana, too, finds reconciliation at the film's end. Her lieutenant survives a brush with death on the war's last day and her hope in love is rekindled. The Count asks for, and dies of, an overdose of morphine from Hana.cairo egypt identity amnesia world war ii burn landmine expedition cave sandstorm cave painting prisoner of war map mine clearer hearing desert scientist intelligence traitor mural painting airplane secret love desert",False,tt0116209,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,231976425,0,0,7.591719444444442,-1.2635471289974909,942706.0,19619090.5,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,132530565.0,10.0,138530565.0,1.0,80187657.0,4.0,86920990.33333333,3.0,1109095.0,0.0,4109095.0,1.0,-3329226.0,7.0,670774.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,248700832.0,254700832.0,1.0,3314476.5,8064476.5,2.0,,,,,,,-8224415.0,3275585.0,1.0,-23060577.0,939423.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3617671.0,23742671.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,57557856.08333333,52624522.75,2.625,1.5,56576255.24926193

When running to the shelter, Edmund runs back to the house to get a photograph of his father for which Peter scolds him. The next morning, they are evacuated to the country home of Professor Digory Kirke, who is not accustomed to having children in his house, as Ms. Macready, the strict housekeeper, explains. While the Pevensies are getting used to the house and playing hide-and-seek out of boredom, Lucy discovers a wardrobe and enters a wintry fantasy world called Narnia to her surprise. Lucy shortly encounters and befriends the faun, Mr. Tumnus, who explains about the land she has just entered and invites her back to his home to which she accepts. There, he puts Lucy to sleep by playing a Narnian Lullaby on his flute. However, when she wakes up, Lucy finds Tumnus grieving, and he explains that Jadis, the White Witch, has cursed Narnia, and it has been winter for one hundred years. If a human is ever encountered, they were to be brought to her. Tumnus takes a huge liking to Lucy and cannot bring himself to kidnap her, so he sends her home. When she returns, hardly any time has passed in the normal world, and her siblings do not believe her story since that when they look in the wardrobe, it has a normal wooden back. Peter then scolds Edmund when he jokes about believing Lucy, to which Edmund responds by yelling at Peter and storms out of the room, believing that Peter is trying to be a father figure . One night, Edmund follows Lucy into the wardrobe, presumably to tease her about the country he thinks she has made up. However, he enters Narnia as well, and shortly after searching for Lucy, he meets the White Witch who claims to be ""The Queen of Narnia"" and her dwarf Ginarrbrik. She offers him Turkish Delight as well as the prospect of becoming king and having power over his siblings if he brings them to her house. After she departs, Edmund and Lucy meet again and return; Lucy tells Peter and Susan about the experience, but Edmund lies about it. The Professor talks with Peter and Susan; he does not understand why they do not believe Lucy's story and gives them three possible logical explanations of Lucy's behaviour — madness, dishonesty and sincerity — the others know she is neither mad nor dishonest, so she must be telling the truth. However, they are still not convinced. While running away from Ms. Macready after accidentally breaking a window while playing cricket, the four siblings retreat to the wardrobe and enter Narnia. There, they apologize to Lucy. They discover Mr. Tumnus has been taken by the Witch's secret police, and meet Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who tell them about Aslan. According to the beavers, Aslan is on the move to take control of Narnia from the Witch. The four must help Aslan and his supporters; it has been prophesied that if two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve sit in the four thrones, the White Witch's reign would end. Edmund sneaks off to visit the Witch, where Mr. Beaver explains the witch's motive and that the siblings now must resort to reaching Aslan to save him. When he arrives at her castle, she is angry that he did not deliver his siblings. The Witch sends wolves to hunt down the children and the beavers, who barely escape with the help of a fox. Edmund is chained in the Witch's dungeon where he meets Tumnus. The Witch demands that Edmund reveal where his siblings are because her police could not find them; Edmund then tells her about Aslan and the witch demands to know where Aslan is. Edmund hesitates when Tumnus claims that Edmund does not know anything and Edmund tells the Witch that he heard no further information regarding Aslan. Seeing that Tumnus is hindering the information, the Witch tells Mr. Tumnus that Edmund betrayed him , then turns Tumnus to stone. While Peter, Lucy, Susan and the beavers travel to the Stone Table, they see what they believe to be the White Witch chasing after them, so they hide. It is really Father Christmas, a sign that the Witch's reign is ending. Father Christmas gives Lucy a healing cordial and a dagger to defend herself with. Susan, a bow and arrows and a magical horn that will summon help when blown, and Peter a sword and shield. Pursued by wolves led by Maugrim, the group crosses a thawing river, leaving the Witch unable to reach them. The Witch's wolves who then appear had captured the fox that helped the Pevensies escape. The Witch then demands that the fox reveals the Pevensies destination. After the fox refuses to comply, the Witch is about to turn him to stone when Edmund reveals that the Pevensies are heading to the Stone Table and that Aslan is already assembling his army. The Witch however still turns the fox to stone and slaps Edmund in the face for hiding information from her. Arriving at Aslan's camp, the group encounters Aslan, who is revealed as a huge and noble lion. Aslan promises to help Edmund in any way he can. Later, two wolves ambush Lucy and Susan while they are frolicking by the river. When Peter intervenes, Maugrim attacks him, and Peter kills him with his sword. After some of Aslan's troops follow the other wolf to the witch's camp and rescue Edmund, Peter is knighted by Aslan. After Edmund and his siblings reunite, The White Witch journeys to Aslan's camp and asserts her claim to the traitor Edmund, but Aslan secretly offers to sacrifice himself instead. That night, as Lucy and Susan covertly watch, Aslan is killed by the White Witch at the Stone Table with a crowd of creatures watching. In the morning he is resurrected because ""there is a magic deeper still the Witch does not know"". Aslan takes Susan and Lucy to the Witch's castle, where he frees the prisoners that the White Witch turned to stone, forming reinforcements for Aslan's army. Edmund persuades Peter to lead Aslan's army to fight the White Witch's forces. Though Aslan's army begins to have a winning streak, the White Witch's huge army is much larger than Aslan's , so it soon begins to lose. To stop the Witch from attacking and killing Peter, Edmund attacks the White Witch and destroys her wand, but is gravely wounded by the Witch in return. Peter, angered at what the Witch did, fights her. As the Witch fights Peter, Aslan arrives with reinforcements and kills her. After Edmund is revived by Lucy's cordial, the Pevensies become Kings and Queens, staying in Narnia until they are adults. Fifteen years later, while chasing a white stag through the forest, they come to the same forest clearing where there is a lamppost that Lucy saw on her first trip to Narnia. Lucy begins to remember, and with Edmund, Susan and Peter following, fights through the trees, where they begin to tumble through the coats and finally out of the wardrobe and return to England, becoming children again. The Professor enters the room and asks what they were doing. Peter replies, ""You wouldn't believe us if we told you, sir."" The Professor tosses him the ball that broke the window and replies, ""Try me."" Lucy later attempts to return to Narnia via the wardrobe, but the Professor tells her he has been trying for many years, and they will probably return to Narnia when they least expect to return.saving the world sibling relationship witch based on novel or book self sacrifice winter cupboard beaver lion fairy tale battle based on children's book fantasy world duringcreditsstinger based on young adult novel",False,tt0363771,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,745013115,0,0,3.13896175,-2.6760407675788414,266689294.0,320689294.0,-37821105.0,72178895.0,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,24900645.666666668,5.0,49367312.333333336,3.0,10512007.0,1.0,41512007.0,1.0,52275268.4,13.0,79015822.2,10.0,,0.0,,,,,,75690773.71428572,142405059.42857143,7.0,659804554.0,789804554.0,1.0,,,,-12041304.0,57958696.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21975011.0,121975011.0,1.0,,,,21975011.0,121975011.0,1.0,851475550.0,976475550.0,1.0,21975011.0,121975011.0,1.0,,,,147216900.0,229216900.0,3.0,,,56631713.844444446,29229307.02222222,2.375,4.666666666666667,109858494.28372188

Unfortunately, Two-Face escapes. Edward Nygma , a researcher at Wayne Enterprises, develops a device to beam television directly to a person's brain; Bruce Wayne  rejects the invention, noting that it ""raises too many questions"", and Edward angrily resigns from his position. After meeting psychiatrist Dr. Chase Meridian , Bruce invites her to a charity circus event. There, Two-Face and his henchmen storm the event in an attempt to discover Batman's secret identity, and in the process murder The Flying Graysons, a family of acrobats. The youngest member, Dick , survives and throws Two-Face's bomb into the river. Bruce assumes responsibility for Dick and allows him to stay at Wayne Manor. Dick then declares his intention to kill Two-Face and avenge his family's murder, and when he discovers Bruce's secret identity as Batman, he insists on becoming his sidekick, ""Robin"". Meanwhile, Nygma becomes a criminal known as the ""Riddler"", the master of puzzles and quizzes and forms an alliance with Two-Face. Using his invention that Bruce had rejected earlier, Nygma can read and control people's minds, and steal their intelligence quotient. At a business party, Edward discovers Bruce's secret identity. Two-Face then attacks the party and nearly kills Batman, but Robin arrives just in time to save his life. However, Two-Face and the Riddler later converge into Wayne Manor. The Riddler enters the Batcave and destroys most of the equipment, and he and Two-Face kidnap Chase, while leaving Bruce another riddle. After solving the last riddle, Batman and Robin locate the Riddler's lair, Claw Island, where both are separated upon reaching the island. Robin then encounters Two-Face and manages to beat him to the ground; realizing that he does not have it in him to commit murder, Robin helps the villain back up. Two-Face gets the upper hand and captures Robin. Meanwhile, Batman manages to make his way into the Riddler's lair, where Robin and Chase are revealed as hostages, giving Batman a choice of saving just one hostage. Batman finds a way to save both hostages, and manages to destroy the brainwave-collecting device, driving the Riddler into a mental breakdown in the process. During the battle, Two-Face falls to his death. The Riddler is finally sent to Arkham Asylum, and Chase is asked to consult on his case. Riddler offers to reveal the identity of Batman to her, but he thinks himself Batman. Chase then meets Bruce Wayne outside and tells him his secret is safe.riddle dc comics rose partner superhero robin broken neck psychologist violence criminal district attorney millionaire super power falling down stairs tied up tommy gun beretta knocked out disfigurement father figure",False,tt0112462,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,336529144,0,0,2.36529144,2.52164293872272,,,77016992.71428572,107745564.14285715,200000000.0,280000000.0,11458340.0,11,20458340.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-6083697.0,7.0,3916303.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,288174462.0,6.0,345674462.0,2.0,376348924.0,6.0,411348924.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,109773545.0,159773545.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,288174462.0,345674462.0,2.0,200000000.0,280000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,243061234.5,285561234.5,2.0,,,,200000000.0,280000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1374595.0,17374595.0,1.0,,,,,,,288174462.0,345674462.0,195349507.25,167474507.25,3.75,1.25,104897737.26798174

The supervillain freezes Robin and flees, warning Batman he has 11 minutes to thaw Robin. They learn that Freeze was scientist Dr. Victor Fries who became dependent on a diamond-powered subzero suit following an accident in a cryogenics lab he was using to find a cure for his wife, Nora , who was suffering from a terminal illness called MacGregor's Syndrome. Meanwhile, in South America, botanist Dr. Pamela Isley  is working under Dr. Jason Woodrue , a mad scientist who recently had his funding cut by Wayne Enterprises and is experimenting with the strength serum ""Venom"". Pamela discovers Dr. Woodrue subjecting a diminutive convict  to the experiment, transforming him into the muscular ""Bane"" . Dr. Woodrue and Pamela argue over the use of the drug and, when she refuses to join him, Woodrue overturns a shelf of various toxins onto her. She transforms into the seductive Poison Ivy before killing Dr. Woodrue with a kiss from her poisonous lips. She leaves with Bane for Gotham, intending to use the chemicals produced by Wayne Enterprises for her schemes. Back in Gotham, Barbara Wilson , Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred Pennyworth's  niece, makes a surprise visit and is invited to stay at Wayne Manor until she returns to college. Alfred is revealed to be suffering from MacGregor's Syndrome. Poison Ivy interrupts a Wayne Enterprises press conference unveiling a new observatory, to propose a project that would turn Gotham City into a lush rainforest, but Bruce turns down the offer. Later, a charity event is held by Wayne Enterprises with special guests Batman and Robin in attendance. Ivy seduces them as well as several other men with her pheromone powder she blows at victims, until Freeze crashes the party and steals a diamond from the event. Freeze is captured by Batman and detained at Arkham Asylum, but flees with the help of Ivy and Bane after dealing the guards who are guarding Freeze. Robin becomes smitten with Ivy and begins to rebel against Batman at Freeze's hideout. Ivy imprisons Robin when he does not give in to her charms and subdues Batman when he confronts her. Barbara – now a costumed crime-fighter calling herself Batgirl — arrives and defeats her. Batman, Robin, and Batgirl go after Freeze together. When they arrive at the observatory where Freeze and Bane are, Gotham is completely frozen from Freeze's ice ray. Robin and Batgirl confront Bane and defeat him, while Batman and Freeze fight, with Batman winning. Freeze destroys the observatory with a set of bombs Bane planted, but Batman escapes. Batgirl and Robin unfreeze Gotham by repositioning the observatory's satellites, which use their mirrors to reflect sunlight, in order to thaw Gotham from outer space. Batman shows Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl, in which she brags about killing Nora. Batman tells Freeze that his wife is not dead; she was restored and moved to Arkham, where he could complete his research. Batman asks Victor for the cure he created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome for Alfred; the ex-scientist atones for his misdeeds by giving him the medicine he had developed. Ivy is detained at Arkham with a vengeful Freeze as her cellmate. Alfred is eventually healed, and everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at the mansion.double life dc comics dual identity crime fighter fictional place superhero credit card super power",False,tt0118688,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,238207122,0,0,0.905656976,-0.16960090051826512,236529144.0,336529144.0,97137159.33333333,119835826.0,81479190.125,116366690.125,71971200.0,13,78371200.0,1.0,,0.0,,,236529144.0,2.0,336529144.0,1.0,20670720.0,9.0,34670720.0,1.0,,0.0,,,270959356.0,8.0,342626022.6666667,3.0,306439034.0,8.0,373939034.0,2.0,,0.0,,,13300027.0,27100027.0,1.0,111734229.66666667,171067563.0,3.0,236529144.0,336529144.0,1.0,,,,,,,236529144.0,336529144.0,1.0,236529144.0,336529144.0,1.0,,,,236529144.0,336529144.0,1.0,270959356.0,342626022.6666667,3.0,,,,,,,236529144.0,336529144.0,1.0,,,,,,,218264572.0,308264572.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,236529144.0,336529144.0,1.0,236529144.0,336529144.0,1.0,,,,236529144.0,336529144.0,1.0,118951869.5,176951869.5,2.0,,,,,,,270959356.0,342626022.6666667,233227224.13333333,181313890.8,5.0,1.6,107279251.96773516

Hoping for a quick victory, Szpilman rejoices with family at home when learning that Britain and France have declared war on Germany, but the German army defeats Poland and captures Warsaw. Living conditions for the Jews deteriorate, as they are allowed a limited amount of money and later must wear armbands with the Star of David. By November 1940, they are forced into horrid and humiliating conditions in the Warsaw Ghetto, where Szpilman's family—including his father and mother —witness how the SS raid an opposite apartment and kill everyone there. Soon the family are rounded up for deportation to Treblinka extermination camp, but Szpilman is saved by a friend in the Jewish Ghetto Police. Szpilman becomes a slave labourer working on the ""Aryan"" side, where he survives a random mass execution. Szpilman learns of a coming Jewish revolt and helps by smuggling weapons into the ghetto, narrowly avoiding a suspicious guard. He then manages to escape and goes into hiding with help from non-Jewish friend Andrzej Bogucki and his wife Janina. In April 1943, Szpilman observes the rise and fall of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising from his window near the ghetto wall. A year goes by and Szpilman is forced to flee after a neighbor discovers him. In a second hiding place provided to him, he is shown into a room with a piano but forced to keep quiet, and suffers jaundice. In August 1944, Polish resistance mounts the Warsaw Uprising, attacking a German building across the street from Szpilman's hideout. A tank shells his apartment and he is forced to flee and hide elsewhere as fighting rages around. Over the course of the next months the city is destroyed and emptied of the population and Szpilman, entirely alone, searches desperately for shelter and supplies among the ruins. Eventually, he is discovered by the Wehrmacht officer Wilm Hosenfeld, who learns that Szpilman is a pianist and asks him to play on the grand piano nearby. The decrepit Szpilman plays Ballade in G minor, which moves Hosenfeld, who then allows Szpilman to hide in the attic of an empty house and regularly brings him food. As the Germans are forced to retreat due to the advance of the Red Army in January 1945, Hosenfeld meets Szpilman for the last time and promises to listen to him on Polish Radio. He gives Szpilman his greatcoat to keep warm and leaves, which is almost fatal for Szpilman when he is shot at by Polish troops liberating Warsaw, who apprehend him and realize he is Polish. Elsewhere, former inmates of a Nazi concentration camp pass a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp for captured German soldiers and hurl abuse at them. Hosenfeld, now a prisoner, asks one of them, the violinist Zygmunt Lednicki, if he knows Szpilman, which the violinist confirms. Lednicki visits Szpilman and takes him to the site, but the POW enclosure has vanished. Later, Szpilman performs Chopin's Grand Polonaise brillante to a large and prestigious audience. The epilogue states that Szpilman died at the age of 88 in 2000, while Hosenfeld died in Soviet captivity in 1952.resistance holocaust (shoah) hunger world war ii prisoner of war homeland ghetto deportation hiding place jew persecution liberation warsaw ghetto polish resistance nazi biography concert survival based on memoir or autobiography pianist poland",True,tt0253474,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,120072577,1,0,2.4306450571428573,0.06660377319308829,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,-13396455.0,17.0,11603545.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-12143288.0,2856712.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-3137195.0,1862805.0,1.0,,,,-1217213.4,15782786.6,5.0,,,,-3137195.0,1862805.0,1.0,,,,-7726637.0,8273363.0,2.0,,,,,,,-3137195.0,1862805.0,1.0,28976270.0,96976270.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11603545.0,-13396455.0,2.125,1.0,95886927.05495417

Juliette ""Jules"" Paxton  is the daughter of an English couple. Jess is infatuated with football, but because she is female , her parents do not allow her to play. However, she sometimes plays in the park with various boys and her good friend Tony, a closet homosexual. When Jules discovers Jess' skills, she invites Jess to try out for her local team, the Hounslow Harriers, coached by Joe , an Irishman. Although initially skeptical, Joe is convinced by watching Jess play, and puts her on the team. Jess lies to Joe about her parents being on board with the idea. She becomes fast friends with Jules and Marlena ""Mel"" Goines . Jess is attracted to Joe, a gora. When the team travels to Hamburg, Jess and Joe's relationship develops; at the end of the night the two are about to kiss when Jules  interrupts them, souring Jess and Jules' friendship. When Jess arrives at Jules' house to try to fix the friendship, Mrs. Paxton is misled and thinks that the pair are involved in a lesbian relationship. Jess' parents learn that she has been playing on the team and become more strict, ensuring she does not attend matches. Meanwhile, the elder Bhamras are distracted by the elaborate preparations for the upcoming wedding of their older daughter, Pinky . Thanks to Jess and Jules' skill, the Harriers reach the finals of the league tournament. An American recruiting scout will be attending. Unfortunately, the final is held on the day of Pinky's wedding. Joe pleads with Mr. Bhamra to allow Jess to play, but he refuses. He reveals that he does not want Jess to suffer as he did when he was kicked out of a cricket club because of his race. Joe accepts that Jess will not play and the final begins without her. Halfway through Pinky's wedding reception, Tony convinces Mr. Bhamra  to allow Jess to play. Tony drives Jess to the final, where the Harriers are 1–0 down, with half an hour remaining. Jess and Jules tie the score, and when Jess is awarded a free kick, she must bend the ball around the wall of players to win the game. She succeeds, and Hounslow wins the tournament. Jess and Jules are offered football scholarships to Santa Clara University in California. Jules tells her parents immediately, but Jess has trouble telling hers. Jules and Mrs. Paxton arrive at the wedding, for Jules to celebrate the scholarship offers with Jess. Again mistaking the girls' mutual affection for something more, Mrs. Paxton accuses Jess of being a hypocrite, and calls her a 'lesbian'. Mortified by the scene her mother is making, Jules grabs her and flees. Jess still has not told her parents of her scholarship, so Tony claims that he and Jess want to get engaged, on the condition that she go to any college she wants prior to their marriage. Jess exposes the lie, stating that she needs to base her future on honesty, and that accepting the scholarship is her heart's desire. Mr. Bhamra talks Mrs. Bhamra into allowing Jess to go, saying that he does not want Jess to give up her dreams as he did. Jess flees to the football field to tell Joe of her parents' decision. The two almost kiss, but Jess pulls away, saying her parents would object; although they had bent their rules to let her go to America to play, she doesn't think they would be able to handle her breaking another cultural taboo. On the day of Jess' and Jules' flight to America, the two families say their separate goodbyes to their daughters. As the two are about to board the plane, Joe arrives and confesses his love for Jess. The two kiss. Jess agrees to sort out their relationship  when she returns for Christmas.

Their mail and supplies are delivered by the rough-and-ready Canadian boat captain Charlie Allnut  of the African Queen, whose coarse behaviour they tolerate in a rather stiff manner.  When Charlie warns them that war has broken out between Germany and Britain, the Sayers choose to stay on, only to witness the Germans burning down the mission village and herding the villagers away. When Samuel protests, he is beaten by a German soldier. After the Germans leave, Samuel becomes delirious with fever and soon dies. Charlie returns shortly afterward. He helps Rose bury her brother, and they set off in the African Queen. In discussing their situation, Charlie mentions to Rose that the Germans have a gunboat, the Queen Louisa , which patrols a large lake downriver, effectively blocking any British counter-attacks. Rose comes up with a plan to convert the Queen into a torpedo boat, and sink the Louisa. Charlie points out that navigating the river would be suicidal: to reach the lake they would have to pass a German fort and negotiate several dangerous rapids. But Rose is insistent and eventually persuades him to go along with the plan. Charlie hoped after passing the first obstacle that Rose would be discouraged, but she is confident they can handle what is yet to come, and argues that Charlie promised to go all the way. During their journey down the river, Charlie, Rose and the African Queen encounter many obstacles, including the German fort and three sets of rapids. The first set of rapids is rather easy; they get through with minimal flooding in the boat. But Rose and Charlie have to duck down when they pass the fortress and the soldiers begin shooting at them, blowing two bullet holes in the top of the boiler and causing one of the steam pressure hoses to disconnect from the boiler, which in turn, causes the boat's engine to stop running. Luckily, Charlie manages to reattach the hose to the boiler just as they are about to enter the second set of rapids. The boat rolls and pitches crazily as it goes down the rapids, leading to more severe flooding in the boat and also collapsing the stern canopy. While celebrating their success, the two find themselves in an embrace. Embarrassed, they break off, but eventually succumb and strike up a relationship. The couple decide to take a pit stop to gather more fuel and drain the boat. Back on the river, Charlie and Rose watch crocodiles frolic on the nearby river bank when the third set of rapids comes up. This time, there is a loud metallic clattering noise as the boat goes over the falls. Once again, the couple dock on the river bank to check for damage. When Charlie dives under the boat, he finds the propeller shaft bent sideways and a blade missing from the propeller. Luckily, with some expert skills and using suggestions from Rose, Charlie manages to straighten the shaft and weld a new blade on to the propeller, and they are off again.  All appears lost when Charlie and Rose ""lose the channel"" and the boat becomes mired in the mud amid dense reeds near the mouth of the river. First, they try to tow the boat through the muck, only to have Charlie come out of the water covered with leeches. All their efforts to free the African Queen fail. With no supplies left and short of potable water, Rose and a feverish Charlie turn in, convinced they have no hope of survival. Before going to sleep Rose prays that she and Charlie be admitted into Heaven. As they sleep, exhausted and beaten, heavy rains raise the river's level and float the Queen off of the mud and into the lake which, it turns out, is just a short distance from their location. Once on the lake, they narrowly avoid being spotted by the Louisa. That night, they set about converting some oxygen cylinders into torpedoes using gelatin explosives and improvised detonators that use nails as the firing pins for rifle cartridges. They then attach the torpedoes through the bow of the Queen. At the height of a storm, they push the Queen out onto the lake, intending to set it on a collision course with the Louisa. Unfortunately, the holes in the bow in which the torpedoes were pushed through are not sealed, allowing water to pour into the boat, causing it to sink lower and eventually the Queen tips over. Charlie is captured and taken aboard the Louisa, where he is questioned by the captain. Believing Rose to have drowned, he makes no attempt to defend himself against accusations of spying and is sentenced to death by hanging. However, Rose is captured too and Charlie hollers her name, then pretends not to know her. The captain questions her, and Rose confesses the whole plot proudly, deciding they have nothing to lose anyway. The captain sentences her too to be executed as a spy. Charlie asks the German captain to marry them before executing them. After a brief marriage ceremony, the Germans prepare to hang them, when there is a sudden explosion and the Louisa starts to sink. The Louisa has struck the overturned hull of the African Queen and detonated the torpedoes. Rose's plan has worked, if a little belatedly, and the newly married couple swim to safety in Kenya.africa missionary river desperation boat patriotism world war i hippopotamus giraffe methodist church moqukito boat wedding leech gin canadian tanzania congo animal species hope faith",False,tt0043265,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,46921,0,0,-20.312418746403534,7.340572626273942,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,73852602.0806271

He leaves behind his wife Oksana and other inhabitants of his village including ""the town rapist"", ""the town mechanic and abortionist"", bringing along his producer Azamat Bagatov and a pet chicken. In New York, Borat sees an episode of Baywatch on television and immediately falls in love with Pamela Anderson. While interviewing and mocking a panel of feminists, he learns her name and her residence in California. Borat is then informed by telegram that his wife has been killed by a bear. Delighted, he secretly resolves to make Anderson his new wife in California; Azamat is told they are going to California because ""Pearl Harbor is there. So is Texas."" Azamat is afraid of flying because of the September 11, 2001 attacks, which he believes were the work of Jews. Borat, therefore, takes driving lessons and buys a dilapidated ice-cream truck for the journey. During the trip, Borat acquires a Baywatch booklet at a yard sale and continues gathering footage for his documentary. He meets gay pride parade participants, politicians Alan Keyes and Bob Barr, and African American youths. Borat is also interviewed on live television and disrupts the weather report. Visiting a rodeo, Borat excites the crowd with jingoistic American remarks, but then sings a fictional Kazakhstani national anthem to the tune of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"", receiving a strong negative reaction. Staying at a bed-and-breakfast, Borat and his producer are stunned to learn their hosts are Jewish. Fearful at the hands of their hosts, the two escape after throwing money toward cockroaches, believing they are their Jewish hosts transformed. While Azamat advises a return to New York, Borat attempts to buy a handgun to defend himself against Jews. When told he cannot buy a gun because he is not an American citizen, Borat purchases a bear for protection. Borat seeks advice from an etiquette coach who suggests that Borat attends a private dinner at an eating club in the South, at which he  insults or otherwise offends the other guests, and gets kicked out after he lets Luenell, an African-American prostitute, into the house and shows her to the table. Borat befriends Luenell, and she invites him into a relationship with her, but he kindly tells her that he is in love with someone else. Borat then visits an antique shop with a display of Confederate heritage items, breaking glass and crockery. The journey is interrupted when Borat, just out of the bathtub, exits the bathroom of his hotel room and sees Azamat masturbating over a picture of Pamela Anderson in the Baywatch book. Borat becomes enraged and reveals his real motive for traveling to California. Azamat becomes livid at Borat's deception, and the situation escalates into a fully nude brawl with homoerotic undertones,Rabin, Nathan.

As a result, Azamat abandons Borat, taking his passport, all of their money, and their bear, whose head is later seen inside Azamat's motel refrigerator. Borat begins to hitchhike to California, but is soon picked up by drunken fraternity brothers from the University of South Carolina. On learning the reason for his trip, they show him the Pam and Tommy sex video, revealing that she is not the virgin he thought she was. After leaving the three students, Borat becomes despondent, burning the Baywatch booklet and, by mistake, his return ticket to Kazakhstan. He regains his faith after attending a United Pentecostal camp meeting, at which Republican U.S. Representative Chip Pickering and Mississippi Supreme Court Chief Justice James W. Smith, Jr. are present. Borat learns to forgive Azamat and Pamela. He accompanies church members on a bus to Los Angeles and disembarks to find Azamat dressed as Oliver Hardy . The two reconcile and Azamat tells Borat where to find Pamela Anderson. Borat finally comes face-to-face with Anderson at a book signing at a Virgin Megastore. After showing Anderson his ""traditional marriage sack,"" Borat pursues her throughout the store in an attempt to abduct her until he is tackled and handcuffed by security guards. Afterwards, Borat marries Luenell, and returns to Kazakhstan with her. The final scene shows the changes that Borat's observations in America have brought to his village, including the apparent conversion of the people to Christianity  and the introduction of computer-based technology, such as iPods, laptop computers and a high-definition, LCD television. The film plays out with a recapitulation of a mock 'Kazakhstan' national anthem glorifying the country's potassium resources and its prostitutes as being the ""cleanest in the region"". The visual melange of Soviet-era photos are mixed with the real flag of Kazakhstan and, incongruously, the final frames show the portrait of Ilham Aliyev, real life president of Azerbaijan, a country that had not been otherwise referenced in the movie.usa california prostitute journalist rodeo kazakhstan demeanor course chicken driving school anti semitism bear mockumentary reporter aftercreditsstinger duringcreditsstinger",False,tt0443453,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,261572744,1,0,13.531819111111117,-3.847336948521819,,,104438243.76923077,127954782.23076923,,,18900000.0,4,25900000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-6944665.0,555335.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18900000.0,25900000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25900000.0,18900000.0,0.5,1.0,92887866.92008553

David's voiceover also relates that all the messages left by the people who died on the 9/11 planes were messages of love and not hate. The film then tells the 'love stories' of many people:  With the help of his longtime manager Joe , aging rock and roll legend Billy Mack  records a Christmas variation of The Troggs' classic hit ""Love Is All Around"". Although he thinks the record is terrible, Mack promotes the release in the hope it will become the Christmas number one single. The song does go to number one; after briefly celebrating his victory at a party hosted by Sir Elton John, Billy recognises that Joe is the ""love"" of his life  and suggests that he and Joe celebrate Christmas by getting drunk and watching porn.  Juliet  and Peter  are wed in a lovely ceremony orchestrated and videotaped by Mark , Peter's best friend and best man. One day Juliet arrives unexpectedly at Mark's apartment and watches his video, discovering that the footage is entirely of her. This confuses Juliet, who thought Mark didn't like her: He never talked to her, avoided her, and was generally distant and uncomfortable around her. He blurts out that he acts that way for 'self-preservation', and she finally realises that he's always been head over heels for her, but has kept it to himself out of respect for her and Peter's relationship. At Christmas Mark takes a moment to truly confess his unrequited love for Juliet , which Juliet acknowledges by giving him a kiss.  Writer Jamie  first appears preparing to attend Juliet and Peter's wedding. His girlfriend  misses the ceremony to sleep with his brother. Crushed by this, Jamie retires to his French cottage where he meets Portuguese housekeeper Aurélia , who speaks only her native tongue. There is an instant attraction between the two. When Jamie returns to England he realises he is in love with Aurélia. In the following times, Jamie learns Portuguese and goes back to propose to her. When he does propose to her she says yes, and it is revealed that she has been learning English to communicate with Jamie.  Harry  is the managing director of a design agency; Mia  is his new secretary. For Christmas he buys her an expensive necklace from jewelery salesman Rufus , who elaborately wraps while Harry becomes increasingly nervous with the fear of detection. Meanwhile, Harry's wife Karen  is busy dealing with their children, Daisy  and Bernard , who are appearing in the school Nativity play. She voices her fears about Harry to her brother David , who just became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and her friend Daniel , who has just lost his wife. Karen discovers the necklace in Harry's coat pocket and initially assumes it is a gift for her; she later confronts Harry over the necklace and he admits his foolishness.  Karen's brother, David , is the recently elected Prime Minister. Natalie  is a new junior member of the household staff at 10 Downing Street and serves his tea and biscuits. Something seems to click between them. David walks in to find the U.S. President  attempting to seduce Natalie, which inspires him to take a stand against the bullying President's policies. Finding that his relationship with Natalie has become strained, David has her moved to another job, but later comes across a Christmas card from Natalie ending with a declaration of her love for him. He eventually finds Natalie at her family's home, seeing that they are on the way to the local school for the nativity play . He drives her family to the play, and the two watch the show from backstage, their budding relationship exposed when a curtain is raised on them kissing at the end of the pageant's big finale.  Daniel , Karen's friend, and his stepson Sam  fend for themselves as they mourn the loss of their wife and mother, Joanna. Sam has fallen for American classmate, also named Joanna , and, after discussion with his stepfather, decides to learn the drums so that he can accompany her in the big finale for their school's Christmas pageant . After Sam feels that he missed his chance to make an impression on her, Daniel convinces Sam that he must go catch Joanna, who is returning to the US, at the airport that night and show her how he feels, lest he regret it for his whole life. Sam runs away from the airport security and says hi to Joanna, who then kisses him on the cheek. Meanwhile, Daniel, who admires supermodel Claudia Schiffer meets Carol  the parent of another of Sam's school mates.  Sarah  first appears at Juliet and Peter's wedding, sitting next to her friend Jamie. We learn she works at Harry's graphic design company, where she has been in love for years with the company's creative director, Karl . A tryst between Karl and her is interrupted by a phone call from Sarah's mentally ill brother, Michael ([[Michael Fitzgerald , and this effectively ends their relationship. On Christmas Eve, she visits her brother at the institution where he lives, wrapping a scarf around him as he hugs her.  After several blunders attempting to woo various English women, including Nancy , the caterer at Juliet and Peter's wedding, as well as Mia, Colin Frissell  informs his friend Tony  he plans to go to the US and find love there, convinced that his Britishness will be an asset to him in a foreign country. Landing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Colin meets Stacey , Jeannie , and Carol-Anne , three stunningly attractive women who fall for his Basildon accent and invite him to stay at their home, where they are joined by roommate Harriet .  John  and Judy , meet as body doubles for the sex scenes in a film where Tony is a production assistant. John tells Judy that ""it is nice to have someone [he] can just chat to."" While the two are perfectly comfortable being naked and simulating sex on-set, they are shy and tentative off-set; they carefully pursue a relationship, and see the play  at the local school together with John's brother.  Rufus is a minor, but significant, character played by Rowan Atkinson, the jewellery salesman whose obsessive attention to gift-wrapping nearly gets Harry caught by Karen buying Mia's necklace. Also, it is his distraction of staff at the airport which allows Sam to sneak through to see Joanna. In the director and cast commentary, it is revealed that Rufus was originally supposed to be a Christmas Angel, however it was dropped from the final script.  In the epilogue set one month later, the film's characters are seen to be in relationships. However, two of the relationships are not romantic - those of rock star Billy Mack and his manager Joe and of long-suffering Sarah and her institutionalised brother Michael. Billy arrives with a gorgeous groupie in tow to be greeted by Joe and indicating that his comeback has remained successful. Juliet, Peter, and Mark come to meet Jamie and his new bride Aurelia, showing both that they have married and that Mark is learning to cope better with the romantic triangle. Karen and the kids greet a returning Harry confirming that they have survived their relationship crisis and reconciled. Sam greets Joanna who has returned with her mother from the US as Daniel looks on, joined by his new girlfriend Carol and her son. John and Judy run into Tony, who is there to meet Colin on his return from the US; they are shown to be just married and off to their honeymoon. Colin returns with the gorgeous Harriet in tow, and Harriet's younger sister Carla  and Tony are immediately struck by each other. Natalie is seen welcoming David back in front of press cameras, indicating that their relationship is now public. These scenes dissolve into live-footage of actual arrivals at Heathrow Airport, which divide the screen and eventually form a heart as The Beach Boys' ""God Only Knows"" plays on.london, england love at first sight u.s. president marseille, france war on terror office christmas party bars and restaurants press conference language barrier prime minister rock star school performance heathrow airport multiple storylines christmas",False,tt0314331,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,244931766,1,0,5.12329415,-14.415123713336484,95757895.92857143,114982753.07142857,77719885.0,82719885.0,67305840.75,102243340.75,106610899.9,15,124510899.9,10.0,143254585.8,14.0,162454585.8,5.0,26855724.42857143,14.0,45927153.0,7.0,346499670.6,8.0,401099670.6,5.0,-15864355.857142856,20.0,18207072.714285713,7.0,,0.0,,,-7939999.0,3.0,22060001.0,2.0,176897844.0,6.0,205897844.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-12143288.0,2856712.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,53161848.0,85136848.0,8.0,,,,91443610.625,115801110.625,8.0,,,,226079933.33333334,250246600.0,3.0,57782013.5,71782013.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,265183243.75,287933243.75,4.0,,,,27826540.0,51167647.6,5.0,,,,,,,,,,229724428.66666666,251057762.0,3.0,,,,464597717.5,529597717.5,2.0,,,140022461.00204083,110902052.83877552,10.0,5.428571428571429,79569518.43496008

He has been coping with divorce after his wife left him for a man who looked exactly like Harrison Ford. He shares his house with an uninhibited Welsh eccentric named Spike . Thacker encounters Hollywood star actress Anna Scott  when she enters his shop to buy a book. Minutes later, the pair collide in the street, causing Will to spill his orange juice on both of them. He offers his house across the road for Anna to change. She accepts and, having changed, surprises Will with a kiss which starts their mutual attraction. Days later, Will asks Spike if he has any messages. Spike has trouble writing or remembering messages but does recall ""some American girl called Anna"" who mentioned a ""completely different name"". Anna is at the Ritz, under the name ""Flintstone"", and has asked Will to visit. Will is allowed in, but her press interviews are still running and he is mistaken for a journalist.  He has to interview some of the cast of Anna's new film Helix, even though he has not seen it. Will is called back to see Anna and she tells him that she has cancelled her evening appointment to go out with him. Will is delighted but then remembers that his sister Honey  is about to have a birthday party, and Anna say that she will be his date. There, at Max's  and Bella's  house, Anna feels at home with Will's friends, but does not win the brownie for being the biggest under-achiever. Afterwards they climb into a private London square. The next day they visit a cinema and eat at a restaurant. Anna invites Will to her room at the Ritz, but her American boyfriend, a famous film star named Jeff King , has arrived unexpectedly. Anna is very embarrassed and disappointed but Will pretends to be a room-service waiter. When King steps out of the room, Anna apologizes; she thought King had broken up with her. Will realizes he must leave. He then tries to forget her but finds it very difficult. Six months later, Anna turns up at Will's house, unannounced. Pictures taken of her as a cheesecake model have been sold to the press and she needs a place to hide out. After spending the day together, Anna goes downstairs to where Will is sleeping and they embrace. They go up to the bedroom where they make passionate love and in the morning Anna asks if she can stay longer. ""Stay for ever"" says Will. The doorbell rings and Will is stunned to see reporters at the doorstep, alerted by careless talk by Spike at the pub. Angry at what she views as Will's betrayal, Anna leaves and he again attempts to forget her.  Six months after that, Anna returns to London to make a Henry James film, which Will had suggested. Will approaches the set of the film and sees Anna, who invites him to watch the day's filming and to talk afterwards. A sound engineer offers Will a pair of headphones to listen in on the dialogue, but he overhears Anna tell her co-star that Will is ""no one, just some guy from the past"". Crushed, Will leaves the set without having talked to Anna. The next day, Anna comes to the bookshop and asks why he had left. Will tells her that he had overheard her remarks. She explains that she didn't want her co-star to know because he is a notorious gossip. Will listens to her but then says that he could not survive a third rejection of his love and turns her down. Having brought him a present, she leaves it behind, still wrapped; it turns out to be an original Marc Chagall painting, La Mariée, that she had seen a print of in Will's home. Will meets his friends, who are supportive of his decision about Anna, until Spike arrives and promptly calls him a ""daft prick"". Will realizes he has made the biggest mistake of his life by letting her go. The group searches for Anna, racing around London in Max's car. They finally reach Anna's press conference and Will persuades her to stay in England with him. Anna and Will later marry, the film concluding with a shot of Will and a pregnant Anna on a park bench in a park.london, england bookshop movie business birthday new love paparazzi press conference wheelchair bath tub cohabitant friendship fame celebration movie star spectacle",False,tt0125439,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,363889678,1,0,7.664039952380952,15.965307217698705,,,56762823.2,69277623.2,,,-11100000.0,3,16900000.0,1.0,61904197.333333336,11.0,69404197.33333333,6.0,-3600207.0,0.0,399793.0,1.0,130844314.0,4.0,162444314.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,22517804.25,38517804.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23792300.25,33042300.25,4.0,,,,248700832.0,254700832.0,1.0,,,,254350122.0,257850122.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,240956751.0,252956751.0,2.0,,,,43889421.8,65389421.8,5.0,,,,,,,,,,183641804.0,194641804.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,62287076.08333333,44512076.083333336,2.25,2.5,73407251.10798967

The woman tells Strombel she thinks Lyman, a handsome British aristocrat with political ambitions, may be the Tarot Card Killer, a notorious serial killer of prostitutes, and that he killed her when she stumbled onto his secret. The Tarot Card Killer left a card on each murder victim's body. Sondra Pransky  is a beautiful but somewhat awkward American college journalism student on vacation in London. Pransky attends a performance given by magician Sid Waterman , aka ""The Great Splendini"", and agrees to participate on the stage. While in a booth known as The Dematerializer, Pransky encounters Strombel's ghost. The ghost has escaped the Grim Reaper himself to impart his suspicions of Lyman to a journalist who can investigate the story.The scene was influenced by one from Federico Fellini’s Nights of Cabiria, in which a stage musician about to be exposed as a fraud performs actual magic. Sondra decides to infiltrate Lyman's privileged world and find out if he truly is the dreaded criminal, enlisting Sid in the process and taking advantage of his powers of deception. Sondra catches Lyman's attention by pretending to drown near him at an exclusive club's swimming pool. When he rescues her, she introduces herself as Jade Spence, daughter of a wealthy oil family from Palm Beach. While Sid poses as her father, ""Jade"" begins dating Lyman. Sondra is convinced Lyman is the murderer, but Sid finds it hard to believe. As the film progresses, however, Sondra falls in love with Lyman and begins to trust him. Meanwhile, Sid becomes less sanguine about Lyman as he notices more and more inconsistencies, especially after he and Sondra find a Tarot deck hidden under a French horn in Peter's vault, a climate-controlled music room containing expensive antique musical instruments. Sid finally prevails upon Sondra to write a news story implicating Lyman, but the newspaper editor refuses the story because of Sondra's lack of proof. Throughout their investigations, Sid and Sondra have a relationship that is in turns friendly, paternal, and also antagonistic—fueled largely by Sondra's annoyance that her smooth ""Jade Spence"" charade is being compromised by Sid's obnoxious attempts to act the part of a nouveau riche oil baron. Soon the police arrest the real Tarot Card Killer. Sondra, relieved that her suspicions were for naught, reveals her real name and the deception she and Sid had practiced. Lyman is surprisingly gracious, and tells Sondra he desires to keep seeing her. They plan to spend the weekend at Lyman's isolated country estate. Later, Sid  suggests that Lyman used the Tarot Card murders to cover up a murder he committed. While Sondra and Lyman vacation in the country, Sid continues to investigate this theory. He finds that Lyman did frequent a prostitute, Betty Gibson, who was later killed, apparently by the Tarot Card Killer. Gibson is described as a ""baby-faced blonde""  before Lyman convinced her to dye her hair, presumably to match the profile of the other Tarot victims. When Sid calls Sondra with his findings, she waves them off. Unbeknownst to her, Lyman is ominously listening in on another extension. Sid breaks into Lyman's vault again, this time finding a mysterious key, which turns out to be for Betty Gibson's flat. Meanwhile, out on a rowboat in Lyman's lake, Lyman confesses to Sondra that he killed Gibson to stop her blackmailing him, and he used the Tarot Card pattern to allay suspicion, just as Strombel had told Sid. Lyman comments on the irony that he first met Sondra by saving her from drowning, and now she really would drown. He would kill Sid later; no one would connect an obscure stage magician's death to that of a clumsy journalism student. This scene is intercut with shots of Sid driving madly to the Lyman estate to rescue Sondra, a shot interrupted by an off-camera crash. After his confession, Lyman throws Sondra into the lake and watches her go under. He then calls the police to report her drowning death. When they question him, he tells them of how Sondra was a terrible swimmer and how she almost drowned that first day at the pool. Suddenly, Sondra enters, soaking wet but smiling cheerfully. She informs Lyman and the police that the drowning had been an act to get his attention, and actually she was a very good swimmer. Back in the newspaper offices, the editor who previously rejected Sondra's article now congratulates Sondra on a brilliant piece of investigative journalism, the start of a promising career. Sondra seems flattered, and says she must also credit Joe Strombel and the late Sid Waterman, Splendini, who is now a passenger on the Reaper's ship, performing for his fellow spirits the same magical gags and comedy routines he did in life.upper class prostitute journalist drowning newspaper magic tarot cards magic show lordship suspicion of murder headline funeral investigation daughter music instrument afterlife swimming pool murder wealth american united kingdom",False,tt0457513,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,31584901,1,0,6.89622525,-3.847336948521819,10110581.555555556,19188359.333333332,,,-4796956.0,13203044.0,34947593.0,5,45780926.333333336,3.0,249359555.0,0.0,459359555.0,1.0,-4796956.0,3.0,13203044.0,1.0,5858355.0,5.0,10158355.0,1.0,34263870.25,19.0,64263870.25,4.0,-11522400.5,2.0,8977599.5,2.0,29982283.5,14.0,52432283.5,4.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32754709.0,49254709.0,2.0,,,,18195382.285714287,50466810.85714286,7.0,-4796956.0,13203044.0,1.0,32754709.0,49254709.0,2.0,,,,22041735.0,33375068.333333332,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,53093421.0,59093421.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,61997575.666666664,79314242.33333333,6.0,,,,,,,,,93453661.9404762,48298900.03571428,6.0,2.2857142857142856,92887866.92008553

The winner of the competition will win the coveted Golden Carrot Award. All are eager to protect their vegetables from damage and thievery by rabbits until the contest, and Wallace and Gromit are cashing in by running a vegetable security and humane pest control business, ""Anti-Pesto"". However, they are soon faced with two problems: first is Wallace's growing weight, while the second is inadequate space for the captured rabbits. Wallace comes up with an idea – use his Mind Manipulation-O-Matic machine to brainwash the rabbits. While performing the operation, a rabbit inexplicably gets fused to Wallace's head, causing the machine to malfunction, and Gromit is forced to destroy the Mind-O-Matic in order to save Wallace. The resulting failure somehow leaves them with a semi-intelligent rabbit who no longer has an appetite for vegetables, whom Wallace dubs ""Hutch"". That night, town is threatened by the ""Were-Rabbit"", a giant rabbit-like monster which eats vegetables of any size. During a chaotic town meeting, Anti-Pesto enters into a rivalry with Lord Victor Quartermaine, who seeks to court Lady Tottington and who believes that it is better to be rid of the rabbits via the use of guns. With Lady Tottington's persuasion, the townspeople agree the Anti-Pesto front the capture attempt. After a hectic night-time chase, Wallace and Gromit come to the theory that Hutch is the Were-Rabbit. Wallace is overjoyed, because this technically means he has already captured the beast, and cheerfully goes to inform Lady Tottington. Securing Hutch to make sure that he does not escape, Gromit instead discovers that the Were-Rabbit is in fact Wallace, suffering from the effects of the accident with the Mind Manipulation-O-Matic having caused him and Hutch to each take on aspects of the other. Alarmed, Gromit seeks out Wallace, retrieves him before the sun sets, and drives him home. Victor corners Wallace during the night, jealous of Lady Tottington's growing fondness for him because of his humane practice of pest control. But when the moon appears, Wallace transforms into the Were-Rabbit before a petrified Victor and his dog Philip. Gromit immediately departs after Wallace. Victor, having identified the Were-Rabbit, decides to dispose his rival to win Lady Tottington's heart. Reverend Clement Hedges allows him access to three ""24-carrot"" gold bullets – supposedly, the only things capable of killing a Were-Rabbit. The following morning, the day has finally arrived for the Vegetable Competition, but Lady Tottington reluctantly bows to public pressure to sanction Victor's offer to shoot the Were-Rabbit. Meanwhile, an oblivious Wallace rebuffs Gromit's accusations of him being the Were-Rabbit, but when Wallace witnesses Hutch expressing his own personality traits, he accepts the truth. Lady Tottington informs Wallace of Victor's plan, but he begins to transform and is left with no other choice but to send her away. Victor and Philip arrive on the duo's doorstep moments later, but Gromit is one step ahead, luring the Were-Rabbit away with a female Were-Rabbit marionette. However, his getaway plan is foiled when Victor mistakenly fires upon what he believes to be the Were-Rabbit, instead discovering it to be Gromit in disguise. Victor and Philip imprison Gromit, who subsequently escapes with help from Hutch and decides to use the marrow he had been growing for the competition as bait for Wallace who has burst in upon the vegetable contest. Victor tries to take the Golden Carrot award from a distressed Lady Tottington, as it is the only golden bullet-like object left to him after he exhausted his supply of golden bullets. Wallace ascends to the rooftops, holding a screaming Lady Tottington in his hand. Discovering his identity after recognising his palm-shaking gesture, she promises to protect him, only to be interrupted by Victor. Meanwhile, in a mid-air dogfight in toy biplanes, Philip pursues Gromit, to prevent him from stopping Victor. Gromit dispatches his foe out of the air, but Philip manages to hold on. In the end, Gromit releases Philip through the bomb doors, dispatching him into a bouncy castle. On the roof of Tottington Hall, Gromit's toy biplane circles Wallace, who clings onto the flagpole at the top of the building. Victor, this time wielding the Golden Carrot trophy inside a blunderbuss he finds at an antiques table at the fair, tries one last time to shoot Wallace, but Wallace is saved by Gromit, who grabs onto a rope from a flagpole and swings his plane into the path of the improvised bullet. Unfortunately, since it is a toy plane not intended for flying, when Gromit accidentally lets go of the rope, the plane begins to descend rapidly. Wallace jumps from the flagpole and catches the plane, thereby breaking Gromit's fall into the cheese tent below. Victor gloats, but is knocked unconscious by Lady Tottington. He falls into the tent, where Wallace lies unconscious and seemingly dying of his injuries. Using the marionette to protect Wallace from the angry mob outside, Gromit dresses Victor up as the monster, as the angry mob chases Victor away. Gromit and Tottington tend to Wallace who seemingly passes away and morphs back into his human form, but Gromit is able to revive Wallace with a slice of Stinking Bishop cheese. Gromit, for his bravery, is awarded the slightly dented Golden Carrot trophy, and Lady Tottington turns Tottington Hall's front garden into a wildlife sanctuary, where Hutch and the rest of the rabbits can live in peace.competition garden northern england village vegetable yorkshire stop motion contest dog rabbit pest control giant vegetable claymation plasticine",False,tt0312004,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,192610372,1,0,5.420345733333333,-2.6760407675788414,179834564.0,224834564.0,179834564.0,224834564.0,,,,0,,,107017135.0,20.0,158517135.0,4.0,45117999.2,9.0,65417999.2,5.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-3329226.0,16.0,670774.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,57315902.333333336,97982569.0,3.0,179834564.0,224834564.0,1.0,179834564.0,224834564.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,179834564.0,224834564.0,1.0,179834564.0,224834564.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,67954044.0,87754044.0,1.0,179834564.0,224834564.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,179834564.0,224834564.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,74868636.06666666,49601969.4,5.625,3.3333333333333335,109858494.28372188

One year later the Skynet system is activated, perceives humans as a threat to its own existence, and eradicates much of humanity in the event known as ""Judgment Day"" . In 2018, John Connor  leads a Resistance attack on a Skynet base. John discovers human prisoners and schematics for a new type of Terminator incorporating living tissue, but he is the only apparent survivor of the attack after the base is destroyed in a nuclear explosion. However, Marcus later emerges from the wreckage of the base and proceeds on foot to Los Angeles. John returns to Resistance headquarters located aboard a nuclear submarine and tells General Ashdown , the current leader, of his discovery. Meanwhile, the Resistance has discovered a radio frequency believed to be capable of sending an order to shut down Skynet machines. They plan to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco in four days, in response to an intercepted ""kill list"" indicating that Skynet plans to kill the Resistance's command staff in a week's time. John learns that his own name is second on the list, following a civilian named Kyle Reese. The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle's importance, but John knows that it is because Kyle will later become his father . John meets with his wife Kate  and his subordinate Barnes ([[Common , and transmits a radio broadcast to Resistance members and surviving civilians around the world. Arriving in the ruins of Los Angeles, Marcus is saved from a T-600 Terminator by Kyle Reese  and his mute child companion Star . Kyle informs Marcus about the war between humans and Skynet. Hearing John's radio broadcast, the three leave Los Angeles in search of the Resistance. They survive an attack, but Kyle, Star, and several other humans are taken prisoner. Two Resistance A-10 airplanes are shot down when they try to intercept the machine transport and its escorts. Marcus locates downed pilot Blair Williams  and they make their way to John's base, but Marcus is wounded by a magnetic land mine. Attempting to save his life, the Resistance fighters discover that he is a cyborg, with a mechanical endoskeleton, circuitry, and a partially artificial cerebral cortex. Marcus believes himself to be human, but John thinks that Marcus has been sent to kill him, and orders his destruction. However, Blair helps Marcus escape from the base. During the pursuit, Marcus saves John's life from Skynet hydrobots, and the two make a bargain: Marcus will enter Skynet's headquarters and attempt to help John rescue Kyle and the other prisoners. John pleads with Ashdown to delay the attack, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However, the Resistance forces disobey Ashdown's orders and await John's signal. Marcus enters the base, interfaces with the computer, and disables the perimeter defenses so that John can infiltrate the cell block and release the human prisoners. Marcus discovers that he was created by Skynet in order to lure John to the base; when the Resistance launches its attack, John will be killed, achieving the goal that Skynet had failed to accomplish so many times. The radio signal that the Resistance's plan depends on is a ruse, and Skynet uses the signal to track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance leaders aboard. Marcus tears out the hardware linking him to Skynet and assists John in battling a new T-800 model 101 Terminator. John is mortally wounded during the fight, but succeeds in destroying the Skynet base by rigging several Terminator fuel cells to explode, detonating them as he, Marcus, Kyle, and Star are airlifted out. Kate attempts to save John's life, but his heart is too damaged. Marcus offers his own heart for transplant, sacrificing himself to save John. Recovering, John radios to the other Resistance fighters that though this battle has been won, the war is far from over.saving the world artificial intelligence prophecy san francisco, california cyborg killer robot gas station post-apocalyptic dystopia army firearm wartime los angeles, california",False,tt0438488,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,371353001,1,0,0.856765005,39.7198236153607,52538140.192307696,83618909.42307693,,,,,178259512.33333334,11,255926179.0,6.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-13525082.0,4.0,674918.0,1.0,99028919.57142857,24.0,139950348.14285713,7.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,279984381.5,454984381.5,2.0,225650550.25,296900550.25,4.0,273531464.0,383531464.0,1.0,39558115.0,74558115.0,1.0,224218673.0,374218673.0,1.0,273531464.0,383531464.0,1.0,,,,,,,44601681.0,84601681.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,83567857.0,203567857.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-38086412.5,26913587.5,2.0,153485600.0,256685600.0,132183815.04761904,87921116.63492064,4.875,4.666666666666667,151278235.71911615

Most of the film takes place in Covent Garden, which at the time was still the wholesale fruit and vegetable market district. Fairly early in the film, the audience sees that fruit merchant Robert Rusk ([[Barry Foster  is in fact the murderer. However, circumstantial guilt has already built up around his friend, Richard Blaney . Blaney's ex-wife Brenda  runs a matchmaking service that Rusk used until he was blacklisted for beating up his dates. One day, Rusk shows up at her office and tries to seduce her; when she spurns his advances, he rapes and strangles her in a fit of rage. Suspicion falls on Blaney, who had earlier threatened her in public. The subsequent murder of Blaney's girlfriend, Barbara ""Babs"" Milligan , occurs off-screen: the audience sees her entering Rusk's apartment with him, but the camera then pulls back down the stairs all the way out to the other side of the street. The audience next sees Rusk at night carrying a large sack and lifting it into the back of a lorry among sacks of unsold potatoes bound for Lincolnshire. Rusk soon finds that his distinctive jeweled tie pin  is missing, and realises that Babs must have torn it off as he was murdering her. He climbs into the back of the lorry, but it starts off on its journey north. The killer desperately scrabbles through the sack of potatoes to find the dead woman's hand. Rigor mortis has set in, and he has to break her fingers in order to prise the pin from her grasp. Blaney is jailed, while protesting his innocence. Chief Inspector Oxford , the detective investigating the murders, reconsiders the previous events and begins to believe that he has arrested the wrong man. He discusses the case with his wife  in several scenes of black humour concerning her ineptitude as a cook. Blaney escapes from prison. Oxford knows he will head to Rusk's flat for revenge, and immediately goes there. Before this, Blaney arrives to find that the door to the flat is unlocked. He creeps in and sees what appears to be Rusk asleep in bed; he strikes the body twice with a metal bar. However, we see that the body is in fact the corpse of another of Rusk's female victims. Oxford bursts through the door. Blaney is still standing by the corpse holding the metal bar. They hear Rusk carrying something large and heavy up the staircase, so the two men wait in the flat. When Rusk enters, he is dragging a large trunk to cart away the body. The film ends with Oxford's urbane but pointed comment, ""Mr. Rusk, you're not wearing your tie.""london, england rape girlfriend police truck murder serial killer pin ex-wife necktie sack potatoes produce seller",False,tt0068611,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,12600000,0,0,2.6,56.838920815200005,-1500000.0,2000000.0,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-66043.0,12.0,83957.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,18825000.0,25475000.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,7750000.0,10250000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9846556.0,13766556.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,75474493.0,81974493.0,1.0,75474493.0,81974493.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,9689970.0,10869970.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,83957.0,-66043.0,1.5,1.0,75944781.91396043

To that end, she marries Larry Maretto , because she believes his family business will keep her financially comfortable, and starts attempting to climb the network news ladder, beginning as a weather girl at a local cable station, WWEN. When Larry, who truly loves Suzanne, starts asking her to take time off from her career to start a family, she immediately plots to get rid of him. To this end, she begins a high school project called ""Teens Speak Out,"" and during a dancing project at her house while Larry is away, she seduces Jimmy Emmett , a disturbed young man, and strong-arms him and his friends, delinquent Russell Heines  and low self-esteemed Lydia Mertz , into killing Larry, whom she describes as abusive and self-centered. Jimmy is reluctant at first, but complies when Suzanne grants him sexual favors and threatens to leave him if he does not. With the aid and abetment of Russell and Lydia, Jimmy ultimately commits the murder, but is wracked with guilt after seeing Larry's rather calm demeanor during the struggle. The police begin investigating when they stumble across a ""Teens Speak Out"" video of Suzanne at Jimmy's school in which Jimmy discreetly hints a relationship  with Suzanne. Jimmy, Russell and Lydia are arrested, but Lydia makes a deal with the police to converse with Suzanne with a tape recorder taped to her stomach, and Suzanne unwittingly reveals her hand in the murder. Despite this undeniable proof of Suzanne's guilt, however, she is acquitted in court, on the basis that the police had resorted to entrapment, and walks free . Jimmy and Russell are sentenced to life in prison and sixteen years, respectively, while Lydia gets out scot-free for her cooperation. In the end, however, Suzanne gets her comeuppance when she fabricates a story about Larry becoming addicted to drugs, desiring to turn over a new leaf and subsequently getting killed by the drug suppliers, Jimmy and Russell, who wanted to keep him silent. Larry's father, Joe , hears this on television, and realizes that Suzanne was behind his son's murder, and consequently uses his mafia connections to have her murdered. The hitman  lures Suzanne away from her home by pretending to be interested in publishing her life story, murders her quietly, then buries her under a frozen lake, her favorite spot, where she once skated. In a final irony, Lydia gains national attention by telling her side of the story in a television interview, becoming a celebrity. The final scene shows Larry's sister, Janice , practicing her figure skating on the frozen lake where Suzanne's corpse is hidden, thus literally dancing on her grave.adultery based on novel or book winter obsession television new hampshire mockumentary narcissistic personality disorder",False,tt0114681,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,21284514,0,0,0.0642257,2.52164293872272,1554476.0,2554476.0,16938627.733333334,23878627.733333334,,,236529144.0,0,336529144.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,288174462.0,345674462.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2400000.0,10400000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,336529144.0,236529144.0,0.0,1.0,104897737.26798174

Dunbar  is injured in the American Civil War. Rather than having his leg amputated, he takes a horse and rides up to the Confederate front lines, distracting them in the process. The roused Union army then attacks and the battle ends a Confederate rout. Dunbar survives, is allowed to properly recover, receives a citation for bravery and is awarded Cisco, the horse who carried him, as well as his choice of posting. Dunbar requests a transfer to the western frontier so he can see its vast terrain before it goes. Dunbar arrives at his new post, Fort Sedgwick, but finds it abandoned and in disrepair. Despite the threat of nearby Native American tribes, he elects to stay and man the post himself. He begins rebuilding and restocking the fort and prefers the solitude afforded him, recording many of his observations in his journal. Dunbar initially encounters his Sioux neighbors when several attempts are made to steal his horse and intimidate him. In response, Dunbar decides to seek out the Sioux camp in an attempt to establish a dialogue. On his way he comes across Stands With A Fist , who has injured herself in mourning of her deceased husband. She is the white adopted daughter of the tribe's medicine man Kicking Bird ([[Graham Greene , as her white family was killed by the aggressive Pawnee tribe when she was young. Dunbar returns her to the Sioux to be treated, which changes their attitude toward him. Eventually, Dunbar establishes a rapport with Kicking Bird and warrior Wind In His Hair  who equally wish to communicate. Initially the language barrier frustrates them, so Stands With A Fist, though with difficulty remembering her English, acts as translator. Dunbar finds himself drawn to the lifestyle and customs of the tribe and begins spending most of his time with them. Learning their language, he becomes a hero among the Sioux and is accepted as an honored guest after he locates a migrating herd of buffalo and participates in the hunt. When at Fort Sedgwick, Dunbar also befriends a wolf he dubs ""Two Socks"" for its white forepaws. When the Sioux observe Dunbar and Two Socks chasing each other, they give him his Sioux name ""Dances with Wolves"". During this time, Dunbar also forges a romantic relationship with Stands with a Fist and helps defend the village from an attack by the rival Pawnee. Dunbar eventually wins Kicking Bird's approval to marry Stands with a Fist, and abandons Fort Sedgwick. Because of the growing Pawnee and white threat, Chief Ten Bears  decides to move the tribe to its winter camp. Dunbar decides to accompany them but must first retrieve his journal from Fort Sedgewick. However, when he arrives he finds it occupied by the U.S. Army. Because of his Sioux clothing, the soldiers mistake him for a Native and open fire, killing Cisco and capturing Dunbar. Sgt Baur  interrogates him, but Dunbar cannot prove his situation as Corporal Spivey  had secretly stolen his journal. As a result, along with Dunbar's refusal to serve as an interpreter to the tribes, he is accused of treason and transported back east as a prisoner. While traveling in the armed caravan, the soldiers kill Two Socks when the wolf attempts to follow Dunbar. Eventually the Sioux track the convoy, killing the soldiers and freeing Dunbar. At the winter camp, Dunbar decides to leave with Stands With A Fist since his status will put the tribe in danger. As they leave, Wind In His Hair shouts across to Dunbar, reminding him of their friendship. U.S. troops are seen searching the mountains but are unable to locate them, while a lone wolf howls in the distance. An epilogue states that thirteen years later the last remnants of Sioux were subjugated to the American government, ending the conquest of the Western frontier states and the livelihoods of the tribes in the plains.countryside based on novel or book culture clash deserter mutiny wolf language barrier self-discovery dakota buffalo unsociability freedom tennessee kansas sioux native american snow pawnee tribe 19th century lakota bison early america",False,tt0099348,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,424208848,0,0,18.28222036363636,16.025788582653266,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-6083697.0,2.0,3916303.0,1.0,,,,92882019.14285715,108324876.28571428,14.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,53472904.0,58972904.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3916303.0,-6083697.0,0.25,1.0,97515116.94264027

Brian grows up an idealistic young man who resents the continuing Roman occupation of Judea. While attending Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, Brian becomes infatuated with an attractive young rebel, Judith. His desire for her and hatred for the Romans lead him to join the People's Front of Judea , one of many fractious and bickering independence movements, who spend more time fighting each other than the Romans. After several misadventures, and escaping from Pontius Pilate, the fugitive winds up in a lineup of would-be mystics and prophets who harangue the passing crowd in a plaza. Forced to come up with something plausible in order to blend in and keep the guards off his back, Brian babbles pseudo-religious truisms, and quickly attracts a small but intrigued audience. Once the guards have left, Brian tries to put the episode behind him, but he has unintentionally inspired a movement. He grows frantic when he finds that some people have started to follow him around, with even the slightest unusual occurrence being hailed as a ""miracle"". After slipping away from the mob, Brian runs into Judith, and they spend the night together. In the morning, Brian opens the curtains to discover an enormous crowd of people outside his mother's house, all proclaiming him to be the Messiah. Brian's mother protests: ""He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy"". Brian finds himself unable to change their minds, because his every word and action are immediately seized as points of doctrine. Neither can the hapless Brian find solace back at the PFJ's headquarters, where people fling their afflicted bodies at him demanding miracle cures. After sneaking out the back, Brian finally is captured and scheduled to be crucified. Meanwhile, a huge crowd has assembled outside the palace. Pilate  tries to quell the feeling of revolution by granting them the decision of who should be pardoned. The crowd, however, simply shouts out names containing the letter ""r"", in order to mock Pilate's speech impediment. Eventually, Judith appears in the crowd and calls for the release of Brian, which the crowd echoes, since the name contains the letter ""r"". Pilate then agrees to ""welease Bwian"". The order from Pilate is eventually relayed to the guards, but in a moment parodying the climax of the film Spartacus, various crucified people all claim to be ""Brian of Nazareth""  and the wrong man is released. Various other opportunities for a reprieve for Brian are denied as, one by one, his ""allies""  step forward to explain why they are leaving the ""noble freedom fighter"" hanging in the hot sun. Hope is renewed when the Judean People's Front come charging towards the Romans, but fail to rescue Brian, as they are a suicide squadron, and kill themselves rather than dying in battle. Condemned to a long and painful death, Brian finds his spirits lifted by his fellow sufferers, who break into song with ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"".Alan Parker, Mick O'Shea  And Now For Something Completely Digital: The Complete Illustrated Guide to Monty Python CDs and DVDs The Disinformation Company, 2006jewry roman empire three kings crucifixion bethlehem independence movement satire religion sermon on the mount cult film anarchic comedy",False,tt0079470,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,20045115,0,0,4.01127875,13.40232829350162,,,4628948.0,5028948.0,,,2267974.0,8,2517974.0,2.0,2267974.0,8.0,2517974.0,2.0,2267974.0,8.0,2517974.0,2.0,2267974.0,8.0,2517974.0,2.0,2267974.0,8.0,2517974.0,2.0,2267974.0,8.0,2517974.0,2.0,,0.0,,,2267974.0,8.0,2517974.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,93931801.0,104931801.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32700000.0,35000000.0,1.0,,,2517974.0,2267974.0,7.0,2.0,97294213.31047031

After having their heads shaved, they meet their Senior Drill Instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman . Hartman employs draconian tactics to turn the recruits into hardened Marines prepared for combat. Among the recruits are Privates ""Joker"" , ""Cowboy"" , and the overweight, bumbling Leonard Lawrence , who earns the nickname ""Gomer Pyle"" after attracting Hartman's wrath. Unresponsive to Hartman's discipline, Pyle is eventually paired with Joker. Pyle improves with Joker's help, but his progress halts when Hartman discovers a contraband jelly doughnut in Pyle's foot locker. Believing that the recruits have failed to improve Pyle, Hartman adopts a collective punishment policy: every mistake Pyle makes will earn punishment for the rest of the platoon, with Pyle being spared. In retaliation, the platoon hazes Pyle with a blanket party, restraining him to his bunk and beating him with bars of soap wrapped in towels. After this incident, Pyle becomes a model Marine. This impresses Hartman, but worries Joker, who recognizes signs of mental breakdown in Pyle, such as talking to his M14 rifle. Following their graduation the recruits receive their Military Occupational Specialty assignments; Joker is assigned to Basic Military Journalism. During the platoon's final night on Parris Island, Joker discovers Pyle in the bathroom loading his rifle with ammunition. Joker attempts to calm Pyle, who executes drill commands and recites the Rifleman's Creed. The noise awakens the platoon and Hartman. Hartman confronts Pyle and orders him to surrender the rifle. Pyle kills Hartman, and then commits suicide. In January 1968, Joker, now a Sergeant, is a Marine War correspondent in Vietnam for Stars and Stripes with Private First Class Rafterman , a combat photographer. Rafterman wants to go into combat, as Joker claims he has done. At the Marine base, Joker is mocked for his lack of the thousand-yard stare, indicating his lack of war experience. They are interrupted by the start of the Tet Offensive as the North Vietnamese Army attempts to overrun the base. The following day, the journalism staff is briefed about enemy attacks throughout South Vietnam. Joker is sent to Phu Bai, accompanied by Rafterman. They meet the Lusthog Squad, where Cowboy is now a Sergeant. Joker accompanies the squad during the Battle of Huế, where platoon commander ""Touchdown""  is killed by the enemy. After the area is declared secure by the Marines, a team of American news journalists and reporters enter Huế and interview various Marines about their experiences in Vietnam and their opinions about the war. During patrol, Crazy Earl , the squad leader, is killed by a booby trap, leaving Cowboy in command. The squad becomes lost and Cowboy orders Eightball  to scout the area. A Viet Cong sniper wounds Eightball and the squad medic, Doc Jay , attempts to save him against orders, being wounded himself. Cowboy learns that tank support is not available and orders the team to prepare for withdrawal. The squad's machine gunner, Animal Mother  disobeys Cowboy and attempts to save his teammates. He discovers there is only one sniper, but Doc Jay and Eightball are killed when Doc attempts to indicate the sniper's location. While maneuvering towards the sniper, Cowboy is shot and killed. Animal Mother assumes command of the squad and leads an attack on the sniper. Joker discovers the sniper, a teenage girl, and attempts to shoot her, but his rifle jams and alerts her to his presence. Rafterman shoots the sniper, mortally wounding her. As the squad converge, the sniper begs for death, prompting an argument about whether or not to kill her. Animal Mother decides to allow a mercy killing only if Joker performs it. After some hesitation, Joker shoots her. The Marines congratulate him on his kill as Joker stares into the distance, displaying the thousand-yard stare. The Marines march toward their camp, singing the Mickey Mouse March. Joker states that despite being ""in a world of shit,"" he is glad to be alive and no longer afraid.suicide prostitute helicopter based on novel or book journalism sniper propaganda vietnam recruit war photographer war correspondent war boot camp rescue jungle infantry sergeant racism violence genocide fighting platoon combat discipline u.s. marine obstacle course mass grave blanket party",False,tt0093058,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,46357676,0,0,1.7269221176470588,2.4643612765605467,,,56700000.0,68700000.0,63316802.875,90716802.875,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21793494.5,29793494.5,6.0,,,,53373402.666666664,78790069.33333333,6.0,17390847.5,32390847.5,2.0,24702193.4,33902193.4,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21793494.5,29793494.5,6.0,22484674.0,35984674.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,65482750.456980206

They bring in two Americans to help: an alluring con artist, Wanda Gershwitz  and their ""weapons man"" Otto West , an Anglophobe who fancies himself as an intellectual. Wanda and Otto are lovers, but hide this fact from George and Ken, pretending to be brother and sister, so Wanda can work her charms on them. The robbery goes well, with the thieves getting away with a large sum in diamonds. The only problem is that they are briefly spotted during their getaway by an old lady walking her dogs. The group then hide the loot in a safe in an old warehouse. Soon after, Wanda and Otto betray George to the police and he is arrested. They return to collect the loot, only to find that George and Ken have moved it to an unknown location. Wanda, who was planning to double-cross Otto as well, decides to seduce George's unhappily married lawyer, Archie Leach , to find out where the diamonds are located. Otto becomes insanely jealous, and his interference, combined with incidences of bad luck, lead Wanda and Archie's liaisons to go disastrously wrong. Archie eventually calls off their attempted affair. Meanwhile, George gives Ken the task of killing the old lady, the Crown's only eye witness. During his various attempts to kill her, the animal-loving Ken accidentally kills off her three Yorkshire Terriers one by one. This causes him grief, as well as grave bodily harm as each attempt goes wrong. However, the witness suffers a fatal heart attack when her last Terrier is killed, and Ken is ultimately successful in his mission. Wanda and Otto want George to remain in jail, but with no witness he may get off. During the course of George's trial, Wanda gives evidence that will lead to a conviction rather than an acquittal. Archie, stunned by the unexpected turn in her evidence, flubs his cross-examination and inadvertently calls her ""darling"". Enraged, George starts a brawl that leads to everyone fleeing the courtroom. Archie's wife Wendy  is sitting in the observer's area, and Archie's antics confirm her suspicions of his affair . After George is taken into custody, she confronts Archie and states that she plans to divorce him. With his career ruined and his marriage about to end, Archie resolves to cut his losses, find the loot, and flee with Wanda to South America. Promised less jail time, George tells Archie that Ken knows the location of the diamonds. As he is leaving to question Ken, Archie picks up Wanda while she attempts to flee the courthouse. Archie tells her he knows that Ken is aware of the hiding spot, and Wanda counters by noting she has the key to the safe deposit box. While the courtroom drama is unfolding, Otto has been trying to get Ken to reveal the location of the diamonds. He tortures Ken by eating the fish in his aquarium one-by-one, leaving the fish called Wanda until the end. In the process, Ken accidentally mentions the location of the diamonds at a hotel near Heathrow Airport. Otto is leaving just as Archie runs into the building; Otto steals Archie's car, taking Wanda with him. Ken tells Archie, as quickly as he can given his stutter, where they are going. The two give chase. The protagonists all end up in Heathrow. Otto and Wanda recover the diamonds, but Wanda quickly double-crosses Otto and locks him in a cupboard. Otto escapes and is briefly captured by Archie, only to turn the tables. He is about to kill Archie, but Archie manages to distract Otto by pointing out that Americans are not always winners - as shown by their loss to North Vietnam in the Vietnam war. While they are arguing, Otto is run over by a steamroller driven by Ken, seeking vengeance for the live fish Otto ate. Archie joins Wanda on board the plane, which taxis for takeoff. Through the plane window, Otto  curses them until, as the plane takes off, he finally drops off.robbery infidelity cheating heart attack heist farce lawyer silencer courtroom american abroad cult film animal abuse barrister stuttering weir yelling killing a dog cutical scissors run over by a steamroller gag excuse barrel zoophilia screwball heathrow airport stolen jewelry",False,tt0095159,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,62493712,0,0,7.332494933333333,1.4934829882721732,,,61298691.25,73928941.25,,,6860354.333333333,17,8360354.333333333,3.0,,0.0,,,7467898.5,6.0,27967898.5,2.0,3878302.25,17.0,8753302.25,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,45629159.0,60629159.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9659917.0,13474917.0,4.0,4628948.0,5028948.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70750955.0,95417621.66666667,6.0,,,,-10100000.0,5900000.0,1.0,,,15027185.027777778,6068851.694444444,5.0,3.0,47137400.206980206

Dith Pran, a Cambodian journalist and interpreter for The New York Times, awaits the arrival of reporter Sydney Schanberg at the city's airport but leaves suddenly. Schanberg, whose flight arrives three hours late, takes a cab to his hotel where he meets up with Al Rockoff . Pran meets Schanberg later and tells him that an incident has occurred in a town, Neak Leung; allegedly, an American B-52 has bombed the town by mistake. Schanberg and Pran try to find transport. Pran is able to sneak them both onto a police boat. It that takes them to Neak Leung where they find that the town has been bombed and hundreds killed and wounded, including women and children. Schanberg and Pran are arrested when they try to photograph the execution of two Khmer Rouge operatives by Cambodian army officers. They are eventually released and Schanberg is furious when the international press corps arrives with the U.S. Army to report a sanitised version of the story. Two years later, in 1975, the embassies are being evacuated in anticipation of the arrival of the Khmer Rouge. Schanberg secures evacuation for Pran, his wife and their four children. However, Pran insists that he would stay behind to help Schanberg, but Pran's family leaves. The Khmer Rouge move into the capital, ostensibly in peace. During a parade through the city, Schanberg, suspicious of the positive way the Khmer Rouge are being welcomed, meets Rockoff, who tells him that he had just come from an area where heavy fighting was taking place. They are later met by a detachment of the Khmer Rouge, who immediately arrest them. Pran is not allowed into the armoured personnel carrier at first, but is able to bribe the Khmer Rouge leader. The group is taken through the city to a back alley where prisoners are being held and executed. Pran, unharmed because he is a Cambodian civilian, negotiates with the Khmer Rouge officer in command for several hours to spare the lives of his friends. They are set free, joining the thousands of refugees fleeing the capital. They do not leave Phnom Penh, but instead retreat to the French embassy and stay there for several days, awaiting their chance to evacuate. Informed that the Khmer Rouge have ordered all Cambodian citizens in the embassy to be handed over and fearing the embassy will be overrun, the embassies comply. Knowing that Pran will be imprisoned or killed, Rockoff and fellow photographer Jon Swain  of The Sunday Times try to forge a British passport for Pran. They use supplies they find in the embassy buildings; however, the picture fades. With no other options available, Pran is turned over to the Khmer Rouge and is forced to live under their totalitarian regime. Several months after returning to New York City, Schanberg is in the midst of a personal campaign to locate Pran. He has appealed to many humanitarian organisations and has kept in close contact with Pran's family in San Francisco. In Cambodia, Pran has become a forced labourer under the Khmer Rouge's ""Year Zero"" policy, a return to the agrarian ways of the past. Pran labours in rice fields under the watchful eyes of young children of both sexes, whom the Khmer Rouge hold in high regard as the future leaders of their regime. Pran is also forced to attend propagandist classes where many undergo re-education. As intellectuals are made to disappear, Pran feigns simple-mindedness. Eventually, he tries to escape, but is recaptured. Before he is found by members of the Khmer Rouge, he slips into a muddy cesspool filled with rotting human corpses; in doing so, he stumbles upon the infamous killing fields of the Pol Pot regime, where it murdered millions of Cambodian citizens. Sydney Schanberg receives a journalism award for his coverage of the Cambodian conflict. At the acceptance dinner he tells the audience that half the recognition for the award belongs to Pran. At the restroom, he is confronted by Rockoff who harshly accuses him of not doing enough to locate Pran and for using his friend to win the award. Schanberg defends his efforts, saying that he has contacted every humanitarian relief agency possible in the four years since Pran's disappearance. Rockoff suggests that Schanberg subtly pressured Pran to remain in Cambodia because Pran was so vital to Sydney's work. This accusation hits close to home, and Schanberg begins to wonder whether he put his own self-interest ahead of Pran's safety. He finally confesses that Pran ""stayed because I wanted him to stay"". Pran is assigned to the leader of a different prison compound, a man named Phat, and charged mostly with tending to his little boy. Pran continues his self-imposed discipline of behaving as an uneducated peasant, despite several of Phat’s attempts to trick him into revealing his knowledge of both French and English. Phat begins to trust Pran and asks him to take ward of his son in the event that he is killed. The Khmer Rouge are now engaged in a border war with Vietnam. The conflict reaches Pran's region and a battle ensues between the Khmer Rouge of the compound and two jets sent to destroy the camp. After the skirmish has ended, Pran discovers that Phat's son has American money and a map leading to safety. When Phat tries to stop the younger Khmer Rouge officers from killing several of his comrades, he is ignominiously shot. In the confusion, Pran escapes with four other prisoners and they begin a long trek through the jungle with Phat’s young son. The group later splits and three of them head in a different direction; Pran continues following the map with one of them. However, Pran’s companion steps on a hidden land mine while holding the child. Though Pran pleads with the man to give him the child, the mine goes off, killing them both. Pran mourns for a time and continues on. One day he crests the escarpment of the Dangrek Mountains and sees a Red Cross camp near the border of Thailand. The scene shifts to Schanberg calling Pran's family with the news that Pran is alive and safe. Soon after, Schanberg travels to the Red Cross camp and is reunited with Pran. Asking Pran to forgive him, Pran answers, with a smile, ""Nothing to forgive, Sydney"", as the two embrace and John Lennon's song Imagine is heard in the background.civil war journalist based on novel or book photographer 1970s vietnam cambodia killing fields red khmer pol pot pulitzer prize embassy based on a true story genocide",False,tt0087553,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,34700291,0,0,1.4097424305555557,3.9275459302257203,36742265.333333336,50075598.666666664,53472904.0,58972904.0,49991294.5,63991294.5,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-23060577.0,939423.0,1.0,,,,53472904.0,58972904.0,1.0,,,,-23060577.0,939423.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25781695.0,44781695.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13120327.0,20445327.0,4.0,,,,,0.0,,48770840.0372125

Renton's close circle of football enthusiast friends are introduced: James Bond-obsessed amoral con artist Sick Boy , clean-cut athlete Tommy , simpleminded, good-natured Spud, and violent sociopath Begbie . Sick Boy, Spud and Renton are all heroin addicts and spend their time shooting up at the flat of their drug dealer ""Mother Superior"" Swanney . After awaking from a heroin induced state, Renton decides to quit heroin. Realizing he needs one last high he buys opium rectal suppositories from Mikey Forrester . After this final hit  he locks himself into a cheap hotel room to endure withdrawal. He realises that being around his friends sober, he feels that he is missing something. He later goes with his friends to a club, finding that his sex drive has returned and eventually leaves with a young woman named Diane . After sex Diane refuses to let him sleep in her room and he spends the night on a sofa in the hallway of the flat. In the morning he realizes that Diane is a fifteen-year-old schoolgirl and that her ""flatmates"" are actually her parents. Horrified, Renton tries to shake the incident but is forced to remain in touch after Diane blackmails him. Tommy had been dumped by his girlfriend Lizzy after a chain of events initiated by Renton. Renton had stolen one of Tommy and Lizzy's personal sex tapes, hiding it in the case of a football video. Lizzy angrily believed that Tommy had returned their tape to the video store. Sick Boy, Spud and Renton decide to start using heroin again and a brokenhearted Tommy begins using as well, despite Renton's reluctance to get him started. One day the group's heroin-induced stupor at Swanney's flat is violently interrupted when Allison, their friend and fellow addict, discovers that her infant daughter Dawn has died from neglect. All are horrified and grief-stricken especially Sick Boy who is implied to be Dawn's father. Renton and Spud are later caught stealing from a book shop and are pursued by security guards and arrested. Due to prior convictions Spud goes to prison but Renton avoids punishment by entering a Drug Interventions Programme, where he is given methadone. Despite support from his family Renton is constantly depressed and bored with life and escapes to Swanney's flat where he nearly dies of an overdose. Renton's parents take him home and lock him in his old bedroom so he can beat the addiction. As Renton lies in his bed and goes through severe withdrawal symptoms, he hallucinates Diane singing on the bed, his friends giving him advice and Allison's dead baby crawling on the ceiling. The heroin withdrawal is inter-cut with an imagined TV game show in which host Dale Winton asks Renton's parents questions about HIV. Renton is finally roused from his nightmares and hallucination by his parents who tell him he needs to get tested. Despite years of sharing syringes with other addicts Renton tests negative. Though clean of heroin, Renton is nevertheless bored and depressed, feeling that his life has no purpose. He visits Tommy in his now dark filthy flat. Tommy is now a full-on heroin addict and is HIV positive. On Diane's advice, Renton moves to London and starts a job as a property letting agent. He begins to enjoy his new life of sobriety and saves up money on the side while corresponding with Diane. Begbie commits an armed robbery and arrives at Renton's London flat seeking a hiding place. Sick Boy, who now sees himself as a well-connected pimp and drug pusher also shows up at Renton's doorstep. They soon learn of Tommy's death from toxoplasmosis and travel back to Edinburgh for his funeral. Back home, they meet Spud, who has been released from prison. Sick Boy suggests a profitable but dangerous heroin transaction, but needs Renton to supply half of the initial £4,000. After the purchase, Renton injects a dose of heroin to test the purity. The four then sell the heroin to a dealer for £16,000. They go to a pub and celebrate, discussing possible plans for the money. As Begbie and Sick Boy leave to order another round of drinks, Renton suggests to Spud that they steal the money, but Spud is too frightened of Begbie to consider it. Renton believes that neither Sick Boy nor Begbie deserve the cash. Early in the morning as the others sleep, Renton quietly takes the money. Spud sees him leave but does not tell the others. When Begbie awakens he destroys the hotel room in a violent rage which attracts the police. Renton travels to London and vows to live a stable, traditional life. Later, Spud finds £2,000 Renton has left for him, so he can have a clean start.london, england scotland based on novel or book drug addiction drug dealer nightclub junkie heroin cold turkey edinburgh, scotland modern society hallucination friendship monolog surrealism dark comedy stealing drug rehabilitation drug dealing drugs cult film recovering addict illegal drugs drug culture antihero",False,tt0117951,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,16491080,1,0,3.12277,-1.2635471289974909,51629753.0,54431836.666666664,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,56576255.24926193

She works in publicity at a book publishing company in London where her main focus is fantasizing about her boss, Daniel Cleaver . At a New Year party hosted by her parents, she re-meets Mark Darcy , the barrister son of her parents' friends. They had known each other as children. After their initial encounter, Mark thinks that Bridget is a fool and Bridget thinks that he is arrogant and rude, and is disgusted by his jumper with a huge reindeer. After a day beset by a series of mishaps, she misplaces her purse, breaks her coffee mug and gets stuck in a lift. When she returns home that evening, her shopping bags split. She reaches to pull the curtains, only for them to fall off the wall. That is the final straw of a stressful day. When she catches sight of her reflection in the window, she decides to turn her life around. She starts her own diary, which covers all her attempts to stop smoking, lose weight and find her Mr. Right. Bridget and Daniel begin to flirt heavily at work, first over email. After a book launch, they start a relationship, despite the fact that he is a notorious womanizer with a questionable personality, of which Bridget is aware, from when stating earlier in the film that she will not form relationships with alcoholics, workaholics, peeping-toms, megalomaniacs, or perverts. Bridget learns from Daniel that he and Mark have a history and, as a result, hate each other. Daniel informs Bridget of their falling-out, telling her that Mark broke their friendship by sleeping with his fiancée. Daniel's dubious character becomes clearer and clearer to Bridget and she eventually breaks off their relationship when she catches him with another woman, a colleague of his, Lara . After a spectacular departure from the office, in which Daniel's desperate attempts to make Bridget stay spark the comment ""I'd rather have a job wiping Saddam Hussein's arse"", she finds a new job in television. She and Mark have run-ins at a bed and breakfast and at a mutual friend's dinner party. During the party, Mark, who has come to the dinner with his colleague, Natasha , privately confesses to Bridget that, despite her faults, he likes her ""just the way she is"". He later helps Bridget to achieve an important interview for work, in which her quirky approach prompts the classic comment ""Bridget Jones - already a legend"". She begins to develop feelings for Mark. Just as Bridget and Mark's mutual attraction comes together at a birthday dinner party hosted by Bridget, Daniel comes back, temporarily claiming Bridget's attention. Mark originally leaves the party, but returns to face Daniel. Mark punches Daniel and the two fight. They end up in a nearby restaurant and finally smash through the window, landing on the street. Mark wins the battle and knocks Daniel out. Bridget chides Mark but afterwards, after an insensitive appeal by Daniel, she says emphatically that she doesn't want to be with him. Bridget learns the truth about Mark and Daniel's falling-out after her mother lets it out in conversation - that it was actually Daniel who had seduced Mark's wife . At a dinner party the same day, Bridget confesses her feelings for Mark, only to find out that he and Natasha are both leaving to accept jobs in New York. Bridget interrupts the toast to their pending engagement with a halting but moving speech about England losing one of its finest men. Her words clearly have an effect on Mark, as he realises what she really means, but he still flies to New York, though with obvious misgivings. Just as Bridget starts to embark on a trip to Paris with her friends to mend her broken heart, Mark returns to stay with her. When they are about to kiss for the first time, Bridget goes to her bedroom to change her undergarments, remarking that this is ""an occasion for genuinely tiny knickers."" While Bridget is changing, Mark peeks at her diary, in which she has written many insults about him. Bridget returns to find that he has left. Realizing that he had read her diary and that she might potentially lose him again, Bridget runs outside after him in a thin sweater and zebra skin-print underwear. Unable to find him and disheartened, she is about to return home when Mark appears holding a new diary, ""to make a fresh start"". They kiss in the snow-covered streets and the film closes.holiday london, england england alcohol sex lovesickness telecaster parent child relationship birthday christmas party news broadcast sexual frustration diary cigarette daughter lawyer reporter extramarital affair duringcreditsstinger woman director",True,tt0243155,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,281929795,0,0,10.2771918,-0.8553948535632829,68987534.44444445,88065927.55555555,63544790.3125,94826040.3125,80865264.54545455,96060537.27272727,,0,,,155321664.33333334,12.0,173988331.0,3.0,88397400.5,13.0,104272400.5,8.0,,0.0,,,23209992.0,9.0,29511838.0,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-11624365.0,1.0,1375635.0,1.0,,,,19104222.333333332,43104222.333333336,3.0,,,,,,,168074943.25,239824943.25,4.0,-23385734.0,1614266.0,1.0,,,,-4835596.0,5164404.0,1.0,192498762.75,208498762.75,4.0,,,,83976836.66666667,100263503.33333333,3.0,,,,,,,58273976.5,80273976.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,267934393.33333334,289934393.3333333,3.0,,,,,,,41947336.0,66780669.333333336,3.0,,,,,,,,,,67006296.0,112006296.0,1.0,40488135.0,77488135.0,2.0,,,77287051.125,63826172.958333336,4.375,3.75,121757219.71668534

In response, British agent James Bond—also known as 007—is summoned to the office of his superior, M. Bond is briefed to investigate Strangways' disappearance and to determine whether it is related to his cooperation with the American Central Intelligence Agency  on a case involving the disruption of Cape Canaveral rocket launches by radio jamming. Upon his arrival at Kingston Airport, a female photographer tries to take Bond's picture and he is shadowed from the airport by two men. He is picked up by a chauffeur, whom Bond determines to be an enemy agent. Bond instructs him to leave the main road and, after a brief fight, Bond starts to interrogate the driver, who then kills himself with a cyanide-embedded cigarette. During his investigation in Strangways' house Bond sees a photograph of a boatman with Strangways. Bond locates the boatman, named Quarrel, but finds him to be un-cooperative. Bond also recognises Quarrel to have been the driver of the car that followed him from the airport. Bond follows Quarrel and is about to be beaten by him and a friend when the fight is interrupted by the second man who followed Bond from the airport: he reveals himself to be CIA agent Felix Leiter and explains that not only are the two agents on the same mission but also that Quarrel is helping Leiter. The CIA has traced the mysterious radio jamming of American rockets to the vicinity of Jamaica, but aerial photography cannot determine the exact location of its origin. Quarrel reveals that he has been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also talks about the reclusive Dr. No, who owns the island of Crab Key, on which there is a bauxite mine: the island and mine are rigorously protected against trespassers by an armed security force and radar. During a search of Strangways' house, Bond found a receipt, signed by Professor R. J. Dent, concerning rock samples. Bond meets with Dent who says he assayed the samples for Strangways and determined them to be ordinary rocks. This visit makes Dent wary and he takes a boat to Crab Key where Dr. No expresses displeasure at Dent's failure to kill Bond and orders him to try again, this time with a tarantula. Bond survives and after a final attempt on his life, sets a trap for Dent, whom he captures, interrogates and then kills. Having detected radioactive traces in Quarrel's boat, where Strangways' mineral samples had been, Bond convinces a reluctant Quarrel to take him to Crab Key. There Bond meets the beautiful Honey Ryder, dressed only in a white bikini, who is collecting shells. At first she is suspicious of Bond but soon decides to help him, leading them all inland to an open swamp. After nightfall they are attacked by the legendary ""dragon"" of Crab Key which turns out to be a flame-throwing armoured tractor. In the resulting gun battle, Quarrel is incinerated by the flame-thrower whilst Bond and Ryder are taken prisoner. Bond and Ryder are decontaminated and taken to quarters before being drugged. Upon waking they are escorted to dine with Dr. No. He reveals that he is a member of SPECTRE  and plans to disrupt the Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered radio beam. After dinner Ryder is taken away and Bond is beaten by the guards. Bond is imprisoned in a holding cell but manages to escape through a vent. Disguised as a worker, Bond finds his way to the control centre, a multi-level room full of high-tech instrumentation with an atomic reactor set into the floor, overseen by Dr. No from a command console. Bond overloads the nuclear reactor just as the American rocket is about to take off. Hand-to-hand combat ensues between Bond and Dr. No; the scientist is pushed into the reactor's cooling vat, in which he boils to death. Bond finds Ryder and the two escape in a boat just as the entire lair explodes.london, england england assassination spy casino based on novel or book exotic island card game space marine intelligence jamaica secret base secret mission baccarat secret organization secret intelligence service nuclear radiation villain secret agent atomic reactor caribbean sea",False,tt0055928,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,59600000,1,0,61.73684210526316,4.1232103568370615,-953079.0,46921.0,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,7250000.0,0.0,9250000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9250000.0,7250000.0,0.0,1.0,64721690.498195834

Paris has fallen in love with Helen , the wife of king Menelaus , and smuggles her back to Troy with him. Infuriated, Menelaus vows revenge. Menelaus approaches his brother Agamemnon ([[Brian Cox , a king who has conquered every army of Greece, and now commands them. Agamemnon, who has wanted to conquer Troy for years , uses this as a justification to invade Troy. General Nestor  asks him to take the legendary warrior Achilles , to rally the troops to the cause. Odysseus , a king of Mycenae commanded by Agamemnon, visits Phtia to persuade Achilles to fight, and finds him training with Patroclus , his cousin. Achilles, pondering his decision, visits his mother Thetis  for advice. She tells him that, before he was even born, she knew this day would come. She also tells him that if he does not go to Troy, he will live a long, happy life and have children, but after he dies, his name will be forgotten and nobody will remember him. If he does go to Troy, he will find great glory in battle, his name will be written into history forever, but he will die there. Achilles, wanting his name to be remembered, chooses to go. The Greeks sail for Troy. Achilles and the Myrmidons are the fastest rowers and land before anyone else. They kill many Trojans and desecrate the temple of Apollo. Briseis , a member of the Trojan royal family, is captured and taken as a prize to the Greeks, despite Achilles claiming her as a war prize himself. Achilles and his Myrmidons do not fight the next day because of Agamemnon's unfair claim to Briseis. With Greeks surrounding Troy, Paris challenges Menelaus to a duel to settle things, using the Sword of Troy, his father claiming that the city's people have a future so long as the sword is in the hands of a Trojan. Menelaus agrees; however, Agamemnon plans on attacking the city regardless of the outcome. Paris is easily defeated, and wounded. Hector intervenes and kills Menelaus. The Greeks charge the Trojan lines but are forced to fall back when they are nearly wiped out by archers on Troy's walls. Ajax is slain in the battle at the hands of Hector. Agamemnon gives Briseis to his men to amuse them after their terrible loss, but Achilles rescues her after they try to rape her. He carries her back to his tent and tends to her wounds. Briseis then tries to kill Achilles but realizes that she has feelings for him and the two make love. The next day, Achilles readies his men to leave, much to Patroclus' indignation. That night, the Trojans launch a surprise offensive against the Greek encampment, aiming to destroy their boats and prevent their escape. As the Greeks seem to be on the verge of defeat, Achilles appears with the Myrmidons and joins the battle, eventually fighting against Hector. The battle goes much better for the Greeks than before, but all are shocked when Hector cuts Achilles' throat. Hector removes his foe's helmet, revealing the face of Patroclus. After Hector finishes the mortally wounded youth mercifully, both armies agree to end fighting for the day. Before he leaves, Odysseus informs Hector it was his cousin whom he had killed. Achilles, who had slept through the battle, is told by Eudorus of his cousin's death. The Greeks had also mistaken Patroclus for Achilles, since he had put on Achilles' armour and moved like Achilles. Furious, Achilles attacks Eudorus and when Briseis tries to stop him, he throws her to the ground. Later that night, Achilles lights Patroclus' funeral pyre. Meanwhile, in Troy, Hector realizes that Achilles will seek revenge for the death of his cousin, and begins making preparations to save his loved ones. He leads Andromache to a secret path out of the city, asking her to use it if the city falls. The next day Achilles approaches the gates of Troy alone and shouts for Hector to come out and face him. Hector knows he must face him alone, so he says his goodbyes to his family and friends and then confronts Achilles. The two fight an evenly matched duel at the start, but Hector begins to tire against the relentless assault of Achilles. Eventually, Achilles slays Hector by stabbing him in the chest with Hector's broken spear. He then ties Hector's body to the back of his chariot, dragging it to the ships, leaving all the Trojans shocked. That night, King Priam  visits the Greek army's camp to convince Achilles to let him retrieve Hector's body. Moved by the king's plea, Achilles acquiesces to his request and allows him to take his son to be buried. Achilles breaks down and cries while preparing Hector's body for transport back to Troy. He tells Priam that Hector was the best he had ever fought. He also gives Priam his word that no Greek will attack Troy for 12 days. Achilles lets Priam take Briseis back as well. He later apologises to Eudorus for harming him and gives him one last order: to take the Myrmidons home.  During the 12 day-truce, Troy mourns Hector's death while Agamemmnon fumes at the loss of an opportunity to end the war once and for all and the Trojans are in disarray at the loss of their top general even though his generals, including Odysseus, inform him that the death Hector makes no difference as the Greeks still can't breach the walls of Troy. Seeing that the mad king will sooner see every one of his own men slaughtered before he gives up his ambition, Odysseus plans to infiltrate the city by building a hollowed-out wooden horse. The Greeks leave the horse at their camp and then depart, hiding their ships in a nearby cove. Priam trusts his priests that the horse is an offering to Poseidon and a gift, despite the misgivings of Paris. Assuming victory, the Trojans take the horse into the city and celebrate. A Trojan scout finds the Greek ships hiding in the cove, but is killed by their archers before he can spread the news. A band of Greeks led by Achilles and Odysseus come out of the horse at night, opening the gates to the city allowing the main army to enter. The Greeks commence the Sack of Troy, massacring the inhabitants and looting buildings. The Trojan army attempts to defend the royal palace but fails and the Greeks storm in. While Troy is burned, Andromache helps Helen and many others escape from Troy through the secret passage Hector showed her. Paris hands Aeneas the Sword of Troy by repeating his father's words that the Trojans will have a future as long as the sword is in Trojan hands. After helping the survivors off, He heads back into the city, bow and arrows at the ready as he had been practicing archery to join the rest of the Trojan army, but abandons them after hearing Briseis' voice calling him. Odysseus kills Glaucus and Agamemnon kills Priam. Achilles searches for Briseis, who is being threatened by Agamemnon. She kills Agamemnon with a concealed knife and is saved from his guards by Achilles. While Achilles is helping Briseis to her feet, Paris, seeking revenge for his brother's death, shoots Achilles several times before Briseis manages to stay his hand. Achilles urges Briseis to join Paris and escape from the city and then dies of the wound to the one spot on his body that was vulnerable, his heel. The soldiers arrive to see the fallen Achilles with only the single arrow through his heel, as he had removed all the others, in keeping with the myth that Achilles was killed by a single arrow to the heel. Funeral rituals are performed for him in the ruins of Troy the next day. The film ends with a speech from Odysseus, ""If they ever tell my story, let them say I walked with giants. Men rise and fall like the winter wheat, but these names will never die. Let them say I lived in the time of Hector, tamer of horses. Let them say, I lived, in the time of Achilles.""sibling relationship adultery mythology beauty trojan war bravery wall fraud hostility epic sword fight battlefield ancient world pyre ancient greece trojan horse trojan bronze age sparta greece helen of troy homer's iliad troy",False,tt0332452,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,497409852,0,0,1.8423420114285716,1.9257596443831189,,,,,,,50803716.0,4,113303716.0,2.0,,0.0,,,80989651.0,3.0,172989651.0,1.0,3596911.0,9.0,31596911.0,1.0,154943067.5,9.0,211443067.5,2.0,38717716.0,8.0,70467716.0,4.0,,0.0,,,18425351.0,42.0,42758684.333333336,3.0,,,,35655061.8,66455061.8,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28049560.0,143049560.0,1.0,55443159.0,107943159.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,256728464.33333334,304728464.3333333,3.0,240883871.0,302550537.6666667,3.0,851475550.0,976475550.0,1.0,376348924.0,411348924.0,1.0,151003148.0,273503148.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,26097823.666666668,65097823.666666664,3.0,141779036.25,174729036.25,4.0,,,,166778310.75,200590810.75,8.0,,,,112635355.0,145635355.0,3.0,,,107093290.97222222,57912735.416666664,9.375,2.1666666666666665,84824632.31357588

Looking for water, he enters a saloon and collapses. He is treated by a doctor, but does not speak or respond to questions. The doctor finds a phone number on Travis, calls the Los Angeles number, and reaches his brother, Walt Henderson , who agrees to pick him up. When Walt arrives in Texas, he discovers that Travis is gone. When he finds him wandering alone, Walt tells his silent brother that he will take him back to Los Angeles. When Travis refuses to fly, Walt rents a car, and the brothers begin a two-day road trip back to Los Angeles. They stop at a motel, but Travis wanders off again. Walt finds him, and the two drive to a diner, where Walt begins to question the still silent Travis more forcefully about his disappearance. Walt and his wife, Anne , have not heard from Travis in four years. After Travis abandoned his son Hunter , Walt and Anne took care of him for four years. Travis is visibly moved by the mention of his son, and tears flow from his eyes. The next day, as the two brothers continue their journey, Travis finally speaks in the car, showing Walt a weathered photograph of a vacant lot. He explains that he purchased the property in Paris, Texas—a town he believes is the place where he was conceived, based on the stories told by their mother. When they arrive in Los Angeles, Travis meets Anne and the son whom he abandoned four years earlier. Hunter is uncomfortable around this stranger who is his father. Walt shows some old home movies, hoping to evoke good memories and help break the ice between the father and son. The movies show Travis with his wife, Jane , and their young son, sharing a day at the beach. In the coming days, the relationship between Travis and his son slowly grows, and a bond of trust between the two starts to develop. Anne tells Travis that although she has not heard from Hunter's mother in a year, Jane still deposits money into a bank account for her son on the same day each month. She reveals the name of the bank in Houston, Texas, where the deposits are made. Travis becomes determined to find his lost wife, and when he tells his son that he plans to travel to Houston to find his mother, the boy says he will accompany him. Travis and Hunter leave for Texas without telling Walt and Anne. During their journey, Travis and Hunter grow closer, with Hunter sharing things he learned in school, and Travis sharing his memories. When they arrive in Houston on the expected day of deposit, Hunter spots his mother leaving the bank. They follow her to a parking lot of a striptease club. Telling Hunter to wait in the car, Travis enters the club, containing rooms where customers sit behind one-way mirrors and tell the strippers what they want to see via telephone. The women cannot see the customers. Travis is shocked, but ends up in a room opposite Jane. After several minutes of awkward silence, Travis walks out, returns to the car, and drives to a bar, where he begins to drink. The next day, Travis drops Hunter off at a downtown Houston hotel , and heads back to the striptease club. Travis enters a room with Jane on the other side of the one-way mirror. He picks up the phone, turns his chair away from her, and tells her a story of a man and a young girl who fell in love, married, and had a child—probably before they were ready. At first, Jane is confused by the story, but she soon understands who is on the other side of the glass telling the true story of their relationship. Travis describes how this couple's love turned from being joyful to stifling, explains how the drunken man suffocated the young girl with his jealousy and control, and tells how he came to loathe himself and why he disappeared to a place with ""no language"" and ""no roads""—never wanting to see anyone again. When Travis prepares to leave, Jane urges him to stay. She tells how hard it was to leave him—that for years she thought of him often. Travis finally faces the glass, turns a lamp on his face so Jane can see him, and tells her where she can find Hunter, asking her to go there and reunite with her son. Jane agrees and Travis leaves the room. Later that day, Jane enters the hotel room where Hunter is waiting, and the mother and child embrace each other. Travis leaves Houston behind him, driving alone.sibling relationship regret texas peep show van mute redemption los angeles, california desert family new german cinema",False,tt0087884,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,2181987,0,0,0.24901657962041576,3.9275459302257203,,,,,,,69088250.5,5,77588250.5,2.0,-2357142.0,0.0,5142858.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41365554.25,33365554.25,0.625,1.5,48770840.0372125

At night, Kerim Bey and Bond go to a rural gypsy settlement, which suffers an attack by Krilencu's men, who wound Kerim Bey and nearly kill Bond, who is saved by a hidden Red Grant. On the following night, Kerim Bey kills Krilencu with Bond's sniper rifle. When Bond returns to his hotel suite, he finds Romanova in bed waiting for him, unaware that they are being filmed by SPECTRE. The next day, Romanova heads off for a pre-arranged rendezvous at Hagia Sophia. The bespectacled man who followed Bond to the airport tries to intercept Romanova's floor plan of the Soviet consulate, but is killed by Grant. Upon finding the body, Bond takes the floor plan, and brings it to Kerim Bey to devise their invasion. After stealing the Lektor, Bond, Romanova, and Kerim Bey escape with the device on the Orient Express. On the train, Kerim Bey and a Soviet security officer named Benz are killed by Grant, who makes it appear as if they killed each other. At Zagreb, Grant boards the train and meets Bond pretending to be agent Nash from ""Station 'Y'"". He drugs Romanova at dinner, then overcomes Bond. Grant taunts him, boasting SPECTRE has been pitting the Soviets and the British against each other, and claims that Romanova thinks that ""she's doing it all for mother Russia"" when she is really working for SPECTRE. Grant also mentions the film of Bond and Romanova at the hotel suite, saying that after both are killed, Grant will plant it in her handbag along with a forged blackmail letter so it looks like it was a murder-suicide. Bond tricks Grant into opening Bond's attaché case in the manner that detonates its tear gas booby trap in his face, allowing Bond to attack him. In the ensuing struggle, Bond eventually manages to stab Grant with the knife hidden in the attaché case, and strangles Grant to death with his own garrotte. At dawn, Bond and Romanova leave the train, hijack Grant's getaway truck, destroy an enemy helicopter, and drive to a dock, eventually boarding a powerboat. Number 1 is very unhappy, and summons Kronsteen and Klebb. He reminds them that SPECTRE does not tolerate failure, and brings in agent Morzeny to then execute Kronsteen with a poisoned spike in the toe of his shoe. Number 1 tells a frightened Klebb that she now has total control of the mission and has one last chance. Klebb sends Morzeny after Bond with a squadron of SPECTRE's boats. Morzeny nearly catches Bond, but the agent sets his pursuers' boats on fire with a signal flare. Bond and Romanova reach Venice and check into a hotel. Rosa Klebb, disguised as a maid, attempts to steal the Lektor. She gets the drop on Bond, and attempts to kill Bond with both a gun and her poisoned toe-spike, but ends up being shot by Romanova. Riding in a gondola, Bond throws the film of him and Romanova into the water as they are rowed away.venice, italy london, england terror england gypsy assassination spy assassin based on novel or book russia secret mission secret organization secret intelligence service kgb orient express zagreb gondola phantom villain duringcreditsstinger",False,tt0057076,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,78898765,1,0,38.4493825,14.350482420740235,28848460.5,29823460.5,58650000.0,59600000.0,58650000.0,59600000.0,58650000.0,1,59600000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,58650000.0,1.0,59600000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,32950000.0,1.0,34425000.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,58650000.0,59600000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,58650000.0,59600000.0,1.0,,,,58650000.0,59600000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,58650000.0,59600000.0,1.0,58650000.0,59600000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,58650000.0,59600000.0,1.0,,,,,,,58650000.0,59600000.0,51208333.333333336,50083333.333333336,0.375,1.3333333333333333,78820932.06047031

There he receives instructions from his superior, M, via CIA agent Felix Leiter to observe bullion dealer Auric Goldfinger, who is staying at the same hotel as Bond. The agent sees Goldfinger cheating at gin rummy and stops him by distracting his employee, Jill Masterson, and blackmailing Goldfinger into losing. Bond and Jill consummate their new relationship; however, Bond is subsequently knocked out by Goldfinger's Korean manservant Oddjob, who then covers Jill in gold paint, killing her by epidermal suffocation. In London, Bond learns that his true mission is determining how Goldfinger smuggles gold internationally. Bond arranges to meet Goldfinger socially and wins a high-stakes golf game against him with a recovered Nazi gold bar at stake. Bond follows him to Switzerland, where there is an attempt on Goldfinger's life by Tilly Masterson to avenge the death of her sister, Jill. Bond sneaks into Goldfinger's plant and discovers that he smuggles the gold by melting it down and incorporating it into the bodywork of his car, which he takes with him whenever he travels. Bond also overhears him talking to a Red Chinese agent named Mr. Ling about ""Operation Grand Slam"". Leaving, Bond encounters Tilly as she is about to make another attempt on Goldfinger's life, tripping an alarm as they leave; they attempt to escape, but Oddjob kills Tilly with his hat. Bond is captured and Goldfinger ties Bond to a table underneath a laser, which begins to slice the table in half. Bond lies to Goldfinger that MI6 knows about Grand Slam, causing Goldfinger to spare Bond's life to mislead MI6 into believing that Bond has things in hand. Bond is transported by Goldfinger's private jet, which flown by his personal pilot, Pussy Galore, to his stud farm near Fort Knox, Kentucky. Bond escapes and witnesses Goldfinger's meeting with U.S. mafiosi, who have brought the materials he needs for Operation Grand Slam. Whilst they are each promised 1 million, Goldfinger tempts them that they ""could have the million today, or ten million tomorrow"". They listen to Goldfinger's plan to rob Fort Knox before Goldfinger kills them all using some of the ""Delta 9"" nerve gas he plans to release over Fort Knox. Bond is recaptured after hearing the details of the operation and tells Goldfinger the reasons why such a plan won't work. However, Bond soon learns from Goldfinger that he has no intention of removing any of the gold from Fort Knox, but to place an atomic device containing cobalt and iodine, which would render the gold useless for 58 years, increasing the value of Goldfinger's own gold and giving the Chinese an advantage resulting from the ensuing economic chaos. Operation Grand Slam begins with Pussy Galore's Flying Circus spraying the gas over Fort Knox. However, Bond had seduced Pussy, convincing her to replace the nerve gas with a harmless substance and alert the U.S. government about Goldfinger's plan. The military personnel of Fort Knox convincingly play dead until they are certain that they can prevent the criminals escaping the base with the bomb. Believing the military forces to be neutralised, Goldfinger's private army break into Fort Knox and access the vault itself. Goldfinger then arrives in a helicopter with the atomic device. In the vault, Oddjob handcuffs Bond to the device. The U.S. troops attack; Goldfinger takes off his coat, revealing a colonel's uniform, and kills Mr. Ling and the troops seeking to open the vault, before escaping himself. Bond extricates himself from the handcuffs, but before he can disarm the bomb, Oddjob attacks him. They fight and Bond manages to electrocute Oddjob. Bond forces the lock of the bomb, but is unable to disarm it. An atomic specialist, who accompanied Leiter, turns off the device with the clock stopped on ""007"". With Fort Knox safe, Bond is invited to the White House for a meeting with the President. However, Goldfinger has hijacked the plane carrying Bond. In a struggle for Goldfinger's revolver, Bond shoots out a window, creating an explosive decompression. Goldfinger is blown out of the cabin through the window. With the plane out of control Bond rescues Galore and they parachute safely from the aircraft.england based on novel or book golf secret organization secret intelligence service nuclear radiation fort knox aston martin secret lab laser kentucky gas attack airplane british secret service duringcreditsstinger",False,tt0058150,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,124881062,1,0,48.952424799999996,10.432329814635038,44865228.666666664,46181895.333333336,67774382.5,69249382.5,67774382.5,69249382.5,67774382.5,2,69249382.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,67774382.5,2.0,69249382.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,,,40699382.5,43449382.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,67774382.5,69249382.5,2.0,,,,67774382.5,69249382.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,67774382.5,69249382.5,2.0,7640272.0,9440272.0,1.0,33145136.0,34520136.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,67774382.5,69249382.5,2.0,,,,,,,67774382.5,69249382.5,69249382.5,67774382.5,0.5,2.0,66409965.942640275

See Disc One, English subtitles for the film, and Disc Two under ""007 Mission Control / Villains / Jacques Bouvar"" Bouvar is alive and disguised as his own widow, but Bond identifies him. Following him to a château, Bond fights and kills him, escaping using a jetpack and his Aston Martin DB5. Bond is sent by M to a clinic to improve his health. While massaged by physiotherapist Patricia Fearing, he notices Count Lippe, a suspicious man with a criminal tattoo (from a [[Tong . He searches Lippe's room, but is seen leaving by Lippe's clinic neighbour who is bandaged after plastic surgery. Lippe tries to murder Bond with a spinal traction machine, but is foiled by Fearing, whom Bond then seduces. Bond finds a dead bandaged man, François Derval. Derval was a French NATO pilot deployed to fly aboard an Avro Vulcan loaded with two atomic bombs for a training mission. He had been murdered by Angelo, a SPECTRE henchman surgically altered to match his appearance.  Angelo takes Derval's place on the flight, sabotaging the plane and sinking it near the Bahamas. He is then killed by Emilio Largo  for trying to extort more money than offered to him. Largo and his henchmen retrieve the stolen atomic bombs from the seabed. All double-0 agents are called to Whitehall and en route, Lippe chases Bond. Lippe is killed by SPECTRE agent Fiona Volpe for failing to foresee Angelo's greed. SPECTRE demands £100 million in white flawless uncut diamonds from NATO in exchange for returning the bombs. If their demands are not met, SPECTRE will destroy a major city in the United States or the United Kingdom. At the meeting, Bond recognises Derval from a photograph. Since Derval's sister, Domino, is in Nassau, Bond asks M to send him there, where he discovers Domino is Largo's mistress. Bond takes a boat to where Domino is snorkelling. After Bond saves her life, the two have lunch together. Later, Bond goes to a party, where he sees Largo and Domino gambling. Bond enters the game against Largo, and wins. Bond and Domino leave the game and dance together. Bond returns to the hotel, uses a connecting door to enter his room and notices someone is also inside. Felix Leiter enters and is silenced by Bond, who finds and disarms a SPECTRE henchman in the bathroom. He releases the henchman, who returns to Largo and is thrown into a pool of sharks. Bond meets Q, and is issued with a collection of gadgets, including an underwater infrared camera, a distress beacon, underwater breathing apparatus, a flare gun and a Geiger counter. Bond attempts to swim underwater beneath Largo's boat, but is nearly killed. Bond's assistant Paula is abducted by Largo for questioning and kills herself. Bond is kidnapped by Fiona, but escapes. He is chased through a Junkanoo celebration and enters the Kiss Kiss club. Fiona finds and attempts to kill him, but is shot by her own bodyguard. Bond and Felix search for the Vulcan, finding it underwater. Bond meets Domino scuba-diving and they have underwater sex. Bond tells her that Largo killed her brother, asking for help finding the bombs. She tells him where to go to replace a henchman on Largo's mission to retrieve them from a submarine. Bond gives her his Geiger counter, asking her to look for them on Largo's ship. She is discovered and captured. Disguised as Largo's henchman, Bond uncovers Largo's plan to destroy Miami Beach.  Bond is discovered, and rescued by Leiter, who orders United States Coast Guard sailors to parachute to the area. After an underwater battle, the henchmen surrender. Largo escapes to his ship, the Disco Volante, which has one of the bombs on board. Largo attempts to escape by jettisoning the rear of the ship. The front section, a hydrofoil, escapes.

The US suspect it to be the Soviets, but the British suspect Japanese involvement since the spacecraft landed in the Sea of Japan. To investigate, MI6 operative, James Bond, agent 007, is sent to Tokyo, after faking his own death. Upon his arrival, Bond is contacted by Aki, assistant to the Japanese secret service leader Tiger Tanaka. Aki introduces Bond to local MI6 operative, Dikko Henderson. Henderson claims to have critical evidence about the rogue craft but is killed before he can elaborate. Bond chases and kills the assailant, disguises himself and gets in the getaway car, which takes him to Osato Chemicals. Once there, Bond subdues the driver and breaks into the office safe of president Mr. Osato. After stealing documents, Bond is chased out by armed security, eventually being picked up by Aki, who flees to a secluded subway station. Bond chases her, but falls down a trap door leading to Tanaka's office. The stolen documents are examined and found to include a photograph of the cargo ship Ning-Po with a microdot message saying the tourist who took the photo was killed as a security precaution. Bond goes to Osato Chemicals to meet Mr. Osato himself, masquerading as a potential new buyer. Osato humours Bond but, after their meeting, orders his secretary, Helga Brandt, to have him killed. Outside the building, assassins open fire on Bond before Aki rescues him. The assassins are disposed of via a helicopter with a magnetic grab. Bond and Aki continue driving to Kobe, where the Ning-Po is docked. After being discovered by more SPECTRE henchmen, they give chase but Bond eludes them until Aki gets away; Bond, though, is captured. He wakes, tied up in Helga Brandt's cabin on the Ning-Po. She interrogates Bond, who bribes his way out of imprisonment. Brandt then flies Bond to Tokyo, but, en route, she sets off a flare in the plane and bails out. Bond manages to land the crashing plane and escapes. Bond then investigates the company's dock facilities and discovers that the ship was delivering elements for rocket fuel. Bond and Tanaka learn that the true mastermind behind this is Ernst Stavro Blofeld and SPECTRE. Blofeld seems to let Brandt's failure slide, but activates a collapsing section of walkway under her, dropping her into a pool of piranha; he then demands that Mr. Osato kills Bond. After finding out where the Ning-Po unloaded, Bond investigates the area by a heavily armed autogyro, Little Nellie. Near a volcano, Bond is attacked by helicopters, which he defeats, confirming his suspicions that SPECTRE's base is nearby. A Soviet spacecraft is then captured by SPECTRE, heightening tensions between Russia and the US. Bond prepares to conduct a closer investigation of the island by training with Tanaka's ninjas, during which an attempted assassination on Bond kills Aki. Bond is disguised and stages a marriage to Tanaka's student, Kissy Suzuki. Acting on a lead from Suzuki, the pair sets out on reconnaissance to the cave—investigating the cave and the volcano above it. Establishing that the mouth of the volcano is a disguised hatch to a secret rocket base, Bond slips in through the crater door, while Kissy returns to alert Tanaka. Bond locates and frees the captured astronauts and, with their help, steals a spacesuit in attempt to infiltrate the SPECTRE spacecraft ""Bird One"". Before he can enter the craft, Blofeld notices Bond and he is detained while Bird One is launched. Bird One closes in on the American space capsule and US forces prepare to launch a nuclear attack on the USSR. Meanwhile, the Japanese Secret Service ninjas climb the mountain to attempt to enter through the upper hatch, but are spotted by the base's security and fired upon. Bond tricks Blofeld and manages to create a diversion that allows him to open the hatch, letting in the ninjas. During the battle, the control room is evacuated and Osato is killed by Blofeld. Bond escapes and fights his way to the control room via Blofeld's office, where he defeats Blofeld's bodyguard, Hans, dropping him into the pool of piranha. Bond activates the spacecraft's self-destruct before it reaches the American craft and the Americans stand down their weapons. Blofeld activates the base's self-destruct system and escapes. Bond, Kissy, Tanaka, and the surviving ninjas escape through the cave tunnel before it explodes, and are rescued by submarine.london, england japan england assassination helicopter vulkan assassin based on novel or book asia secret identity nasa island russia missile war ship ninja fighter secret base secret mission secret organization secret intelligence service phantom villain sumo ringer volcano funeral space soldier killer secret service blast",False,tt0062512,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,111584787,1,0,10.745767052631583,11.942441850165755,98406371.25,101143871.25,78534481.2,80924481.2,98406371.25,101143871.25,98406371.25,5,101143871.25,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,85976609.0,5.0,87793275.66666667,3.0,,,,84868871.25,88243871.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,98406371.25,101143871.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,81091748.0,83779248.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,51583582.666666664,60839582.666666664,3.0,,,,,,,98406371.25,101143871.25,94468573.45833334,92191490.125,1.25,3.5,71522021.83152917

The woman, Contessa Teresa ""Tracy"" di Vicenzo invites Bond to her hotel room to thank him. The next morning, Bond is kidnapped by several men while leaving the hotel, who take him to meet Marc-Ange Draco, the head of the European crime syndicate Unione Corse. Draco reveals that Tracy is his only daughter and tells Bond of her troubled past, offering Bond a personal dowry of one million pounds if he will marry her. Bond refuses, but agrees to continue romancing Tracy under the agreement that Draco reveals the whereabouts of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE. After a brief argument with M at the MI6 headquarters, Bond heads for Draco's birthday party in Portugal. There, Bond and Tracy begin a whirlwind romance, and Draco directs the agent to a law firm in Bern, Switzerland. At Bern, Bond investigates the office of Swiss lawyer Gumbold, and finds out Blofeld is corresponding with the London College of Arms' genealogist Sir Hilary Bray, attempting to claim the title 'Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp'. Posing as Bray, Bond goes to meet Blofeld, who has established a clinical allergy-research institute atop Piz Gloria in the Swiss Alps. There Bond meets ten young women, the ""Angels of Death"", who are patients at the institute's clinic, apparently cured of their allergies. At night Bond goes to the room of one patient, Ruby, for a romantic encounter. At midnight Bond sees that Ruby, apparently along with each of the other ladies, goes into a sleep-induced trance while Blofeld gives them audio instructions for when they are discharged and return home. In fact, the women are being brainwashed to distribute bacteriological warfare agents throughout various parts of the world. Bond tries to trick Blofeld into leaving Switzerland, so the British Secret Service can arrest him without violating Swiss sovereignty; Blofeld refuses, and Bond is eventually caught by the henchwoman Irma Bunt. Blofeld reveals he identified Bond after his attempt to lure Blofeld out of Switzerland, and tells his henchmen to take the agent away. Bond eventually makes his escape by skiing down Piz Gloria while Blofeld and many of his men give chase. Arriving at the village of Lauterbrunnen, Bond finds Tracy and they escape Bunt and her men after a car chase. A blizzard forces them to a remote barn, where Bond professes his love to Tracy and proposes marriage to her, which she accepts. The next morning, Blofeld attempts to kill Bond by causing an avalanche and captures Tracy. Back in London at M's office, Bond is informed that Blofeld intends to hold the world to ransom with the threat of destroying its agriculture using his brainwashed women, demanding amnesty for all past crimes and that he be recognised as the current Count de Bleuchamp. M tells 007 that the ransom will be paid and forbids him to mount a rescue mission. Bond then enlists Draco and his forces to attack Blofeld's headquarters, while also rescuing Tracy from Blofeld's captivity. The facility is destroyed, and Blofeld escapes the destruction alone in a bobsled, with Bond pursuing him. The chase ends when Blofeld becomes snared in a tree branch and injures his neck. Bond and Tracy marry in Portugal, then drive away in Bond's Aston Martin. When Bond pulls over to the roadside to remove flowers from the car, Blofeld  and Bunt commit a drive-by shooting of the couple's car that kills Tracy. A police officer pulls over to inspect the bullet-riddled car, prompting a tear-filled Bond to mutter that there is no need to hurry to call for help by saying, ""We have all the time in the world"", as he cradles Tracy's lifeless body.london, england suicide england based on novel or book switzerland secret identity new identity honeymoon secret mission secret organization secret lab villain kilt family history snow storm daughter espionage killer british secret service snow skiing alps mountains aftercreditsstinger",False,tt0064757,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,81974493,1,0,11.611460461538462,3.420752390415132,82459532.16666667,86034532.16666667,99142054.4,103232054.4,99142054.4,103232054.4,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-1500000.0,2.0,2000000.0,1.0,47599588.333333336,7.0,49249588.333333336,3.0,,0.0,,,,,,88312054.4,92912054.4,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,99142054.4,103232054.4,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,98406371.25,101143871.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,84558.0,364937.0,1.0,,,,,,,99142054.4,103232054.4,25624794.166666668,23049794.166666668,1.125,2.0,87507197.41396043

On his 11th birthday, Harry learns from a mysterious stranger, Rubeus Hagrid, that he is actually a wizard, famous in the Wizarding World for surviving an attack by the evil Lord Voldemort when Harry was only a baby. Voldemort killed Harry's parents, but his attack on Harry rebounded, leaving only a lightning-bolt scar on Harry's forehead and rendering Voldemort powerless. Hagrid reveals to Harry that he has been invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After buying his school supplies from the hidden wizarding street, Diagon Alley, Harry boards the train to Hogwarts via the concealed Platform {{frac}} in King's Cross Station. On the train, Harry meets Ron Weasley, a boy from a large, but poor, pure-blood wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a witch born to Muggle  parents. Once they arrive at the school, Harry and all of the other first-year students are sorted into four different houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. As Slytherin is noted for being the house of darker wizards and witches, Harry successfully begs the magical Sorting Hat not to put him in Slytherin. He winds up in Gryffindor, along with Ron and Hermione. At Hogwarts, Harry begins learning wizardry and also discovers more about his past and his parents. Harry inadvertently makes Gryffindor's Quidditch team  as a Seeker, learning that his father was also a member of the team. One night, he, Ron, and Hermione find a giant three-headed dog on the Forbidden Corridor on the Third Floor at the school. The trio successfully take down an escaped mountain troll and after Harry is nearly knocked off his broom by a powerful curse during one of the Quidditch matches, the trio assume that someone is trying to get past the dog. Harry discovers the Mirror of Erised which shows a person's heart's desire. The headmaster Albus Dumbledore moves the mirror and advises Harry against looking for it. Using information accidentally let slip by Hagrid, Hermione discovers that the dog is guarding the Philosopher's Stone, an item that can be used to grant its owner immortality. Harry concludes that his potions teacher, Severus Snape, is trying to obtain the stone. Harry is caught out of bed at night and is given detention. While helping Hagrid in the dark forest Harry sees a hooded figure drinking a unicorn's blood for its healing properties. Harry concludes that the hooded figure was Voldemort and that Snape is trying to get the stone to restore Voldemort to full strength. After hearing from Hagrid that the dog will fall asleep if played music and that he let slip this to a man in the local pub one night, Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide that Snape was the man in the pub and attempt to warn Dumbledore. Upon learning he is away on business the trio conclude that Snape will attempt to steal the stone that night and resolve to find the stone before Snape does. They face a series of obstacles: surviving a deadly plant, flying past hundreds of flying keys and winning a violent, life-sized chess match. The trio use their skills to overcome the obstacles. Hermione uses her knowledge of spells to get past the plant, Harry uses his skills as a seeker to get past the keys and Ron uses his skill at chess to win the chess match. However, Ron is nearly killed in the match and Hermione stays with Ron as Harry goes on ahead, alone. In the final room, Harry finds out that it was not Snape who wanted the stone, but Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Quirrell. Quirrell reveals that he let the troll in and tried to kill Harry in the Quidditch match. He also reveals that Snape has been protecting Harry and trying to stop Quirrell all year. Quirrell forces Harry to look in the mirror. Due to an enchantment placed by Dumbledore, Harry finds the stone in his pocket after looking in the nearby Mirror of Erised. While trying to get Harry to answer what he has seen in the mirror, Quirrell removes his turban and reveals Voldemort to be living on the back of his head. Harry tries to escape but Quirrell starts a fire by clicking his fingers to trap him. Voldemort tries to convince Harry to give him the stone by promising to bring his parents back from the dead, but Harry refuses. Quirrell tries to kill him but Harry's touch prevents Quirrell from hurting Harry and causes his hand to turn to dust. Quirrell then tries to take the stone but Harry grabs his face, causing Quirrell to turn into dust and die. When Harry gets up, Voldemort's spirit forms and passes through Harry, knocking him unconscious, before fleeing. Harry wakes up in the school's hospital wing, with Professor Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed, and that both Hermione and Ron are fine. Quirrell burned at Harry's touch because, when Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a magical, love-based protection against Voldemort. At the end of year feast, Dumbledore gives last minute house points to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville for their bravery and smarts so Gryffindor win the house cup. Before Harry and the rest of the students leave for the summer, Harry realises that while every other student is going home, Hogwarts is truly his home.witch based on novel or book christmas party magic halloween child hero broom chosen one frog fantasy world wizard based on young adult novel wizarding world hogwarts",False,tt0241527,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,976475550,1,0,6.8118044000000015,-0.8553948535632829,79485472.55555555,119663250.33333333,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,178820213.5,25.0,232820213.5,2.0,,0.0,,,186861516.33333334,6.0,262861516.33333334,3.0,34778107.0,6.0,50778107.0,3.0,22480396.25,16.0,33480396.25,4.0,,,,245218018.0,300218018.0,1.0,,,,28976270.0,96976270.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,210823361.5,284823361.5,2.0,41155701.14285714,54512844.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-39808601.0,7191399.0,1.0,-1577515.0,33422485.0,1.0,64874678.0,97999678.0,4.0,90222797.83333333,115139464.5,6.0,-6439124.0,7060876.0,1.0,91247027.5,107497027.5,2.0,,,,204976425.0,231976425.0,1.0,55025879.333333336,99025879.33333333,3.0,,,,,,144985058.27083334,105735058.27083334,6.625,3.0,121757219.71668534

Harry finds Dobby the house elf, who warns against returning to Hogwarts. When Harry refuses, Dobby causes havoc in the house and frames Harry for ruining Vernon's meeting. Vernon locks Harry in his room to prevent his return to Hogwarts. That night, Ron, Fred, and George Weasley arrive in their flying car to rescue Harry from the clutches of Uncle Vernon, who discovers the rescue and tries to pull Harry back into his room. The Weasleys succeed and take Harry to The Burrow, their home. Harry meets Ron's younger sister, Ginny, who is about to begin at Hogwarts and has a crush on Harry. Harry also meets Ron's father, Arthur Weasley; he had met Mrs. Weasley the previous year. Harry and the Weasleys travel to Diagon Alley by Floo Powder. While shopping, Harry meets Gilderoy Lockhart, a famous wizard and author, and later Draco Malfoy and his father, Lucius, who praise Voldemort and deride Harry, Hermione and the Weasleys. At King's Cross Station, though the rest of the Weasleys reach Platform 9 3/4 without trouble, Harry and Ron find the magical barrier blocked; as a result, they miss the Hogwarts Express. Harry and Ron take the flying car and reach Hogwarts, but accidentally land in the school's violent tree, the Whomping Willow. Ron's wand is broken and the car behaves erratically, ejecting the boys and driving itself into the Forbidden Forest. When Harry and Ron enter Hogwarts they are seen by Snape, who scolds them for flying the car to Hogwarts and nearly expels them. Professor McGonagall and Professor Dumbledore arrive and McGonagall defends the boys and tells them they will receive detention only. Shortly after the start of term, Harry begins hearing an ominous, icy, cold voice coming from inside the walls, starting in his detention with Lockhart. Harry, Ron and Hermione find the message ""The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware"" written in blood across a wall and discover that caretaker Argus Filch's cat has been petrified, who blames it on Harry and attempts to attack him but is stopped by Dumbledore and McGonagall. Legend has it that the Chamber of Secrets can only be opened by the Heir of Slytherin; it is said to be the home of a creature that will only obey the Heir. Harry suspects the Heir is Malfoy. Gilderoy Lockhart, hired to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts, offers a dueling club. At the meeting Draco conjures a snake that Harry discovers he can talk to. Hermione explains that he is a Parselmouth like Salazar Slytherin, a connection that causes the school to believe Harry is his Heir. The three brew Polyjuice Potion to disguise themselves as Malfoy's friends Crabbe and Goyle, and interrogate Malfoy, but learn that he is not the Heir. In a bathroom Harry finds a book with nothing written in it that belonged to someone named Tom Marvolo Riddle. Through the enchanted book Harry sees events that happened fifty years ago when Tom was a student. Tom's memories incriminate Hagrid as the Heir. Over the course of the school year, Colin Creevey, Justin Finch-Fletchley, the Gryffindor ghost Sir Nicholas and even Hermione are all found petrified, and Tom Riddle's diary goes missing. Harry and Ron decide to ask Hagrid, but before Hagrid can answer the real identity of who opened the Chamber, Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge and Lucius Malfoy arrive. While Ron and Harry hide, the visitors tell Hagrid they are suspending Dumbledore as headmaster and arresting Hagrid under suspicion of having opened the Chamber. Before Hagrid is taken away to Azkaban prison, he tells Ron and Harry to follow the spiders into the Forbidden Forest for the truth. They do so and meet Aragog, a giant spider thought to have killed a student fifty years ago. Aragog reveals that he is not the monster who killed the student and that Hagrid is innocent. Aragog's sons and daughters attack Harry and Ron, but the flying car rescues them. Harry and Ron learn from a piece of paper in Hermione's hand that the monster is a basilisk and overhear the teachers saying that Ginny has been taken into the Chamber. Lockhart is sent to find the Chamber and save Ginny, but tries to escape until Harry and Ron catch him. It turns out Lockhart's past is false; he used memory-erasing charms on witches and wizards to take credit for their accomplishments. The three find the chamber entrance in Moaning Myrtle's  bathroom and enter to find a giant snake skin. After he faints, Lockhart tries to stop Harry and Ron by using a memory charm, but it backfires. Lockhart loses his memory and part of the Chamber caves in, separating Harry from the others. Harry finds Ginny and Tom Riddle appears, explaining that he is a memory preserved in the diary. Riddle tells Harry that Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber that sent the basilisk to attack, and wrote threatening messages on the wall because he ordered her to. Harry learns that Riddle is Slytherin's Heir and is Lord Voldemort in his teenage form. Riddle sends the basilisk to kill Harry but Dumbledore's phoenix, Fawkes, attacks the basilisk's eyes. Fawkes gives Harry the Sorting Hat, from which he draws the sword of Godric Gryffindor. Although Harry kills the basilisk by driving the blade up through its head, a fang embeds itself in his arm and poisons him. Harry destroys Voldemort/Riddle by piercing the diary with the fang. Ginny regains consciousness and finds Harry dying, but Fawkes heals Harry's wound with his tears. Dumbledore resumes his post as Headmaster and sends in the paperwork to have Hagrid released from Azkaban. Dumbledore assuages Harry's concerns of his worthiness to belong to Gryffindor House by pointing out that only a true member could have summoned Godric's sword. Learning that Lucius gave the diary to Ginny and that Dobby serves the Malfoys, Harry tricks Lucius into freeing him from servitude. At the year-end feast, all of the basilisk's victims are back to full health, and Hagrid receives a standing ovation as he returns to Hogwarts. In a post-credits scene, a new Gilderoy Lockhart book is on display at Flourish & Blotts, entitled ""WHO AM I?"" and depicting an amnesiac, confused Lockhart in a straitjacket.flying car witch magic child hero broom school of witchcraft giant spider giant snake black magic child driving car aftercreditsstinger based on young adult novel wizarding world",False,tt0295297,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,876688482,1,0,7.76688482,0.06660377319308829,851475550.0,976475550.0,851475550.0,976475550.0,113366389.45,157026389.45,851475550.0,1,976475550.0,1.0,851475550.0,1.0,976475550.0,1.0,851475550.0,1.0,976475550.0,1.0,403038659.0,26.0,480705325.6666667,3.0,238952467.75,7.0,282202467.75,4.0,851475550.0,1.0,976475550.0,1.0,11232691.8,13.0,30432691.8,5.0,353015024.75,7.0,441265024.75,4.0,,,,548346784.0,638346784.0,2.0,,,,440225910.0,536725910.0,2.0,851475550.0,976475550.0,1.0,,,,851475550.0,976475550.0,1.0,424374091.0,515374091.0,3.0,4228953.0,5728953.0,1.0,,,,851475550.0,976475550.0,1.0,,,,-3251544.5,18748455.5,2.0,152283256.0,214255256.0,5.0,28976270.0,96976270.0,1.0,851475550.0,976475550.0,1.0,405833474.5,491833474.5,2.0,424949017.5,504949017.5,2.0,294194034.0,352194034.0,1.0,198973191.0,238187476.7142857,7.0,422518213.0,491768213.0,2.0,344656535.0,397156535.0,3.0,309666347.5,404666347.5,2.0,79648286.28571428,104005429.14285715,7.0,254138297.0,318388297.0,4.0,354640427.0,457640427.0,1.0,851475550.0,976475550.0,642563463.7458333,551517630.4125,7.125,2.5,95886927.05495417

When Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge, comes for a visit and infuriates Harry by insulting his parents, he accidentally causes her to inflate and fly away. Harry loses his temper and threatens to curse Vernon but flees, fed up with his life at Privet Drive. The Knight Bus appears and delivers Harry to the Leaky Cauldron, where Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge tells him he will not be arrested for the use of magic on his aunt. After reuniting with Ron, and Hermione, Harry learns that Sirius Black, a convicted supporter of Lord Voldemort, has escaped Azkaban prison and is likely intending to kill Harry. Harry, Ron and Hermione head back to school on the Hogwarts Express. They unknowingly share a compartment with the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, who is sleeping. When the train abruptly stops, Dementors board, searching for Black because Harry mentioned his name. One of the Dementors enters their compartment, prompting Harry to pass out whilst under the impression of a woman screaming. At this time, Lupin awakes and repels the Dementor with a Patronus Charm. At Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore informs students that the Dementors will be guarding the school while Black is at large. Professor Lupin is introduced, and Hagrid is announced as the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher. Lupin's lessons prove enjoyable; he focuses on practice, not just theory, and encourages less confident students such as Neville when he faces a boggart in the form of his worst fear, Professor Snape. However, Hagrid's first class goes awry when Draco Malfoy deliberately provokes the Hippogriff, Buckbeak, who then attacks him. Draco's father Lucius Malfoy has Buckbeak sentenced to death on court. That evening the trio find a crowd at the door to their dormitory, and The Fat Lady missing from her portrait. She is located in a different picture, and she tells Dumbledore that Black has entered the castle. Filch, Lupin and Snape secure and search the castle, but they find no one. As the Gryffindor Dormitory has been compromised, the students sleep in the main hall which allows Harry to overhear an argument between Snape and Dumbledore about Lupin's suspected role. During a stormy Quidditch match, several Dementors approach and overpower Harry, causing him to fall off his broomstick, which is then destroyed by the Whomping Willow. Lupin secretly teaches Harry to defend himself against Dementors using the Patronus charm. As Harry lacks parental permission to visit Hogsmeade, Fred and George  give him their Marauder's Map, a magical document showing every person's location within Hogwarts, as well as secret passageways in and out of the school castle. At Hogsmeade, Harry notices Fudge and Madam Rosmerta, discussing Black. He follows them after he hears mentioning his name, and overhears that Black is his godfather and was his parents' best friend. Black was accused of divulging the Potters' secret whereabouts to Voldemort and murdering their mutual friend Peter Pettigrew by blowing him up. Out of anger, Harry vows to avenge his parents, and kill Black. Late at night, Harry is reading the Marauder's map, when he notices Peter Pettigrew's name on it. He exits the dormitory and follows him. He follows Pettigrew, on the map, but is unable to see him anywhere. He instead sees Snape on the map, but fails to avoid him. Snape initially confiscates the map, but hands it over to Lupin who arrives to take Harry to his classroom, keeping the map and admonishing Harry for wandering the castle while Black is at large. Before leaving, Harry mentions to Lupin seeing Pettigrew on the map, leaving Lupin astonished. After a class of Divination, Professor Trelawney enters a trance and predicts that the Dark Lord's servant will return that night. Later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione visit Hagrid to console him over Buckbeak's impending execution. While there, they discover Scabbers, Ron's missing rat. Fudge, Dumbledore, and an executioner arrive at Hagrid's to carry out Buckbeak's execution, and the three students hurry away to avoid being discovered. Scabbers suddenly bites Ron, escaping, and as the trio chase him a large dog appears and drags both Ron and Scabbers into a hole at the Whomping Willow's base. Harry and Hermione are attacked by the tree but also manage to enter the underground passage to the Shrieking Shack. There they discover that the dog is actually Sirius Black, who is an Animagus. Harry attacks Black, but Lupin arrives and disarms Harry. After exchanging a few cryptic words with Black, Lupin then embraces him as an old friend. When confronted by Hermione, Lupin admits to being a werewolf, and he and Black begin to explain that Black is innocent. Professor Snape bursts in, intending to hand over Black to the Dementors, but Harry, having doubts, knocks him out with a spell. Lupin and Black explain that Scabbers is actually Peter Pettigrew, an Animagus who committed the crime for which Black was convicted. Lupin and Black force Pettigrew back into his human form preparing to killing him, but Harry intervenes saying that his father would not have wanted his two best friends to become killers. Pettigrew is instead to be turned over to the Dementors. As the group heads to the castle, the full moon rises; Lupin transforms into a werewolf, and Pettigrew manages to escape in the confusion. Lupin and Black fight in their animal forms, until Lupin is distracted by another animal's howls. Dementors attack Black and Harry. As Dementors are preparing to suck out their souls and perform the Dementor's Kiss, Harry sees a distant figure cast a powerful stag-shaped Patronus that scatters the Dementors, and sends them away. Harry believes the mysterious figure is his dead father. Harry passes out from the trauma, and awakens to find he is in Hogwarts and Sirius has been captured. Acting on advice from Dumbledore, Hermione reveals that she possesses a time-turner that she has used all year to take multiple classes simultaneously. She and Harry travel back in time three hours, watching themselves repeat that night's events. They free Buckbeak, and return to the Whomping Willow. As the Dementors overpower Black and his earlier self, Harry realises that he himself was the one to cast the Patronus, and rushes to do so. Harry and Hermione then rescue Black, who escapes on Buckbeak, commenting that they are both now fugitives. Lupin resigns the next day, knowing that parents will object to a werewolf teaching their children. Shortly after, Black anonymously sends Harry a Firebolt, the fastest racing broom ever made.flying traitor magic child hero broom school of witchcraft black magic time travel best friend werewolf muggle aftercreditsstinger based on young adult novel wizarding world",False,tt0304141,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,789804554,1,0,5.075419646153846,1.9257596443831189,814082016.0,926582016.0,814082016.0,926582016.0,144953155.76190478,191296012.9047619,814082016.0,3,926582016.0,2.0,814082016.0,3.0,926582016.0,2.0,814082016.0,3.0,926582016.0,2.0,66024662.25,18.0,93899662.25,4.0,,0.0,,,322905019.8333333,9.0,375071686.5,6.0,4042264.0,3.0,12042264.0,3.0,437749716.2,9.0,528349716.2,5.0,,,,624460683.3333334,717794016.6666666,3.0,,,,,,,,,,45629159.0,60629159.0,1.0,,,,512452688.75,605702688.75,4.0,31717184.75,36217184.75,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-9773208.0,226792.0,1.0,402832376.0,486832376.0,2.0,,,,529451810.3333333,620118477.0,3.0,542195505.6666666,628862172.3333334,3.0,535441258.0,614441258.0,2.0,271187602.375,318000102.375,8.0,540574969.3333334,620074969.3333334,3.0,452664521.75,517039521.75,4.0,,,,10827799.0,36977799.0,2.0,204931766.0,244931766.0,1.0,376348924.0,411348924.0,1.0,814082016.0,926582016.0,541301339.5642858,467566815.7547619,6.0,3.4285714285714284,84824632.31357588

At Hogwarts, headmaster Albus Dumbledore introduces ex-Auror Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. In their first Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson, the students learn of the three Unforgivable Curses. The Imperius Curse causes absence of free will, the Cruciatus Curse causes unbearable pain, and the final curse, Avada Kedavra, causes death. Dumbledore announces that the school will host the Triwizard Tournament, in which one wizard from each of the three magical schools competes in three challenges. The champions are selected by the Goblet of Fire, a magical cup into which the candidates' names are placed. Fred and George attempt to enter using an aging potion as no one under 17 can enter. This fails miserably. Cedric Diggory, a student from the House of Hufflepuff, is chosen to represent Hogwarts, Viktor Krum is chosen to represent Durmstrang Institute, and Fleur Delacour is selected to represent Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. The Goblet unexpectedly chooses a fourth champion: Harry. As Harry is underage and should have been ineligible to compete, Hogwarts teachers and students grow suspicious, and the feat drives Ron and Harry apart. The teachers want Dumbledore to pull Harry out of the tournament, but the four champions are bound by a magical contract and therefore Dumbledore has no choice and Harry must compete. For the first task of the Triwizard Tournament, each of the champions must retrieve a golden egg guarded by a dragon. Mad-Eye advises Harry to use his talent for flying to overcome the dragon. Harry enters the first task and summons his broomstick to retrieve the egg, which contains information about the second challenge. The students are soon informed of the Yule Ball, a Christmas Eve ball held during the Triwizard Tournament. Ron and Harry have trouble finding dates to the ball and when they find out that Hermione is attending with Viktor Krum, Ron becomes jealous. In exchange for previous aid, Cedric provides Harry with a clue that prompts him to open the egg underwater. With help from Moaning Myrtle, he learns that the second task entails the retrieval of ""something precious"" to each of the competitors from the nearby Black Lake, where there are mermaids. While preparing for the task, Neville Longbottom provides Harry with Gillyweed, enabling him to breathe underwater for one hour. Harry is the first to arrive at the location, and finds Ron, Hermione, Cho Chang and Fleur's sister, Gabrielle, in suspended animation. Finishing last after attempting to free Ron and Gabrielle, Harry is awarded second place for ""outstanding moral fiber"", behind Cedric. Following an exchange with Mad-Eye, Ministry official Barty Crouch, Sr. is found dead by Harry shortly after the second task. While waiting in Dumbledore's office, Harry's curiosity leads him to look into Dumbledore's pensieve, causing him to revisit one of Dumbledore's memories. He witnesses a trial before the Wizengamot in which captured Death Eater Igor Karkaroff, the current headmaster of Durmstrang, denounces a number of Death Eaters, including both Severus Snape and Barty Crouch Jr. While Dumbledore vouches for Snape's integrity, Crouch Sr. is horrified at this revelation and disowns his maniacal son, sending him to Azkaban. Upon returning to the present time, Dumbledore tells Harry that he is searching his memories for a clue as to why extraordinary events have taken place at Hogwarts since the start of the tournament. In the Triwizard Tournament's third and final task, the competitors are placed inside a hedge maze; their challenge is to reach the Triwizard Cup. Krum, acting under the Imperius curse, incapacitates Fleur and attempts to do the same to Cedric. Harry stops Cedric from attacking Krum, and the two run for the cup. When Cedric is trapped by vines, Harry frees him and the two claim a draw and grab hold of the cup together. The cup, which is a Portkey, transports the two champions to a graveyard where Wormtail and Voldemort are waiting for Harry. Wormtail murders Cedric, traps Harry, then performs a ritual that rejuvenates Voldemort, who then summons the Death Eaters  and bids them to witness a duel between their Dark Lord and his nemesis. As Harry, who is tortured by Voldemort, fights him, a connection called Priori Incantatem occurs between their wands. Harry's wand forces Voldemort's to disgorge the spirits of the people Voldemort has most recently murdered, including Harry's parents, Frank Bryce and Cedric. Harry is briefly protected by the spirits and escapes with Cedric's body  using the cup. Upon his return, Harry tells Dumbledore and Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge that Voldemort has returned and is responsible for Cedric's death. Mad-Eye leads a devastated Harry back to the castle, where his questions make Harry suspicious. Mad-Eye reveals it was he who put Harry's name in the Goblet, assisted Cedric and Neville in helping Harry, cursed Krum and so on. Dumbledore, Snape and McGonagall arrive and force Veritaserum, a truth-telling potion down Mad-Eye's throat. He reveals he is not Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody and the real one is imprisoned in a magical trunk minus his magical eye and fake leg. The false Mad-Eye's Polyjuice Potion  wears off and he is revealed as Barty Crouch Jr., who shows a pulsing Dark Mark tattoo on his forearm meaning Voldemort's returned. Soon after, students and staff of Hogwarts, Durmstrang and Beauxbatons gather in the Great Hall to say farewell to Cedric. Dumbledore exhorts them to stand together against Voldemort, as the representatives from Durmstrang and Beauxbatons leave Hogwarts.based on novel or book magic dying and death broom school of witchcraft chosen one black magic boarding school vision tournament teenager wizard teenage hero based on young adult novel wizarding world",False,tt0330373,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,895921036,1,0,4.9728069066666665,-2.6760407675788414,,,168355492.04545453,218500946.5909091,762656195.3333334,880989528.6666666,762656195.3333334,4,880989528.6666666,3.0,762656195.3333334,4.0,880989528.6666666,3.0,762656195.3333334,4.0,880989528.6666666,3.0,53573562.0,9.0,74644990.57142857,7.0,131978008.4,4.0,176778008.4,5.0,371033524.71428573,10.0,434319239.0,7.0,474758855.8333333,10.0,571925522.5,6.0,78155344.28571428,9.0,141583915.7142857,7.0,-4133687.6666666665,44199645.666666664,3.0,79947721.33333333,103581054.66666667,6.0,776688482.0,876688482.0,1.0,659804554.0,789804554.0,1.0,,,,776688482.0,876688482.0,1.0,122776188.5,127776188.5,2.0,22800595.8,44200595.8,5.0,60151018.7,95431018.7,10.0,,,,814082016.0,926582016.0,2.0,,,,7943578.333333333,37230245.0,3.0,290843782.0,350843782.0,3.0,488489768.6666667,587823102.0,3.0,,,,562039996.25,662539996.25,4.0,571597767.75,669097767.75,4.0,576895690.0,672895690.0,3.0,314367263.6666667,370422819.2222222,9.0,570382365.5,662507365.5,4.0,494092528.2,571592528.2,5.0,44611950.0,118611950.0,2.0,184070704.2222222,233570704.2222222,9.0,335956945.0,402123611.6666667,6.0,320714372.6666667,402381039.3333333,3.0,762656195.3333334,880989528.6666666,505277532.7732143,424683485.1541667,6.75,5.125,109858494.28372188

This encounter has had a huge psychological effect on Harry – he has nightmares not only about what happened in the graveyard but also about the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic. While at the Order's headquarters, 12 Grimmauld Place, Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, mentions that Voldemort is after an object which he didn't have last time. Upon arrival at Hogwarts, Harry learns that Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge has appointed a new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor: Dolores Umbridge, a senior Ministry official who refuses to teach practical magic due to her belief that Dumbledore is forming a rebellion against the Ministry. Umbridge and Harry immediately clash, as she refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned and forces Harry to carve 'I must not tell lies' into the skin on the back of his hand through a cursed quill. When Ron and Hermione notice these scars, they are outraged but Harry refuses to go to Dumbledore as he has distanced himself from him since the summer. As Umbridge's control over the school increases, Ron and Hermione aid Harry in forming a secret group to train students in defensive spells, calling themselves ""Dumbledore's Army"". The Slytherin students are recruited by Umbridge to uncover the group. Meanwhile, Harry and Cho Chang develop romantic feelings for each other and begin a relationship during Christmas, Cho being Harry's first kiss at the last DA meeting before the holidays. However, Harry discovers that his behaviour is becoming erratic and possibly more similar to Voldemort's. Harry has a vision involving an attack upon Arthur Weasley in the Department of Mysteries, from the point of view of Arthur's attacker. Fearing Voldemort will exploit his connection to Harry, Dumbledore instructs Professor Snape to give Harry Occlumency lessons to block his mind from Voldemort's influence. These lessons increase Harry's psychological problems, as he is forced to relive everything bad that has ever happened to him. During one lesson, Harry got annoyed at what he saw and requested a break but Snape refused and forced Harry to continue the lesson. This only got the spell reversed on him by Harry where Harry sees the Vision on why Snape hates his father, James, who often had bullied him. The connection between Harry and Voldemort leads Harry to distance himself from everyone, and he pushes not only Ron and Hermione but Ginny, Neville, the Weasley twins and Luna away, as he feels ""so angry all the time"". Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius' deranged cousin, escapes from Azkaban along with nine other Death Eaters. At Hogwarts, Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad uncover Dumbledore's Army after illegally interrogating Cho with Veritaserum. Dumbledore covers up for Harry, but escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. With Dumbledore gone, Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress. Harry's relationship with Cho falls apart, mostly due to Cho having betrayed Dumbledore's Army to Umbridge . During an O.W.L. exam, the Weasley twins revolt and set off fireworks in the Great Hall, causing chaos for Umbridge. During this event, Harry has a vision of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort within the Department of Mysteries. Harry, Ron and Hermione rush to Umbridge's fireplace to alert the Order via the Floo Network, since it is the only one not being monitored, but Umbridge stops them before they can do so. When she threatens to use the Cruciatus Curse to get information out of Harry about the trio's intentions, Hermione deceives Umbridge into entering the Forbidden Forest in search for Dumbledore's ""secret weapon"". She and Harry lead her to the hiding place of Hagrid's half-giant brother, Grawp, only to be confronted by centaurs who kidnap Umbridge after she attacks them. When Umbridge tells Harry to make the centaurs let her go and that she means no harm Harry says, ""Sorry, Professor. I must not tell lies"". Harry, Hermione, Ron, Luna, Neville and Ginny fly to the Ministry of Magic on Thestrals in an attempt to save Sirius. The six enter the Department of Mysteries where they uncover a prophecy involving Harry and Voldemort, the object Voldemort was after. However, they are ambushed by Death Eaters including Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange. Lucius reveals that Harry only saw a dream of Sirius being tortured; it was not an actual situation, rather a method to lure Harry into the Death Eater's grasp. Lucius attempts to persuade Harry to give him the prophecy, telling him it will reveal why Voldemort could not kill Harry when he was an infant. Harry refuses and a fight between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters ensues. The Death Eaters take everyone except Harry as hostages, threatening to kill them if he does not surrender the prophecy. Harry obliges just as Sirius and Remus Lupin arrive with Order members Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Mad-Eye Moody. They attack the Death Eaters and Lucius drops the prophecy, destroying it. Harry and Sirius duel him. Just as Sirius defeats Lucius, Bellatrix kills Sirius. Despite Remus trying to hold him back, Harry goes after Bellatrix, who runs away continuously saying ""I killed Sirius Black"" in a song-like manner. Harry chases and corners Bellatrix in the Atrium and attempts to torture her with the Cruciatus Curse, but to little avail . Voldemort appears, but Dumbledore arrives through the Floo Network moments before Voldemort can kill Harry. A duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore ensues while Bellatrix escapes. After the two prove evenly matched, Voldemort possesses Harry in order to try to get Dumbledore to sacrifice Harry in the hope of killing him, but the love Harry feels for his friends and Sirius makes it impossible for Voldemort to remain in his body. Ministry officials arrive before Voldemort disapparates; Fudge is forced to admit that Voldemort has returned and resigns as Minister. Dumbledore returns as headmaster of Hogwarts after he and Harry are vindicated. Dumbledore explains that he distanced himself from Harry all year hoping it would lessen the risk of Voldemort using their connection. Harry comes to terms with the prophecy; ""Neither can live while the other survives."" As Harry and his friends head towards the Hogwarts Express, Harry tells his friends that even though a war is beginning, unlike Voldemort, they have something worth fighting for.prophecy witch loss of loved one magic child hero dying and death broom school of witchcraft black magic sorcery supernatural occult mystical land based on young adult novel wizarding world",False,tt0373889,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,938212738,1,0,5.254751586666667,-6.117028646878049,193467037.4347826,247953993.95652175,758472405.5,884722405.5,,,758472405.5,6,884722405.5,4.0,758472405.5,6.0,884722405.5,4.0,758472405.5,6.0,884722405.5,4.0,198759880.2857143,6.0,254331308.85714287,7.0,140116996.25,11.0,177304496.25,8.0,814082016.0,6.0,926582016.0,2.0,447301505.125,12.0,543926505.125,8.0,370281930.4444444,12.0,437504152.6666667,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1818479.0,7818479.0,1.0,,,,791361689.3333334,916361689.3333334,3.0,,,,,,,404613095.5,487113095.5,4.0,,,,349379388.0,454379388.0,2.0,598816204.2,709216204.2,5.0,21975011.0,121975011.0,1.0,619152026.5,728652026.5,4.0,357522640.9,422972640.9,10.0,,,,,,,465340392.3333333,562007059.0,3.0,82278754.0,188278754.0,2.0,,,,,,,758472405.5,884722405.5,624226961.9248512,530744943.07564485,8.125,5.75,105980128.20199434

Traumatized by her previous encounter with the Alien, Ripley initially refuses, but accepts after Burke promises that the team will destroy any Aliens found and not attempt to study them. Aboard the warship Sulaco she is introduced to the Colonial Marines, including Sergeant Apone , Corporal Hicks , Privates Vasquez  and Hudson , and the android Bishop , toward whom Ripley is initially hostile due to her previous experience with the android Ash aboard the Nostromo. The expedition descends to the surface of LV-426 via dropship, where they find the colony seemingly abandoned. Two living facehuggers are found in containment tanks in the medical lab. The only colonist found is a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt . The marines determine that the colonists are clustered in the nuclear-powered atmosphere processing station, where they find a large Alien nest filled with the cocooned colonists. The Aliens attack, killing most of the unit and capturing Apone and Dietrich. Ripley is able to rescue Hicks, Vasquez, and Hudson. With Gorman knocked unconscious during the rescue, Hicks assumes command and orders the dropship to recover the survivors, intending to return to the Sulaco and destroy the colony from orbit. A stowaway Alien kills the dropship pilots in flight, causing the vessel to crash into the processing station. The surviving humans barricade themselves inside the colony complex. Ripley discovers that it was Burke who ordered the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship where the Nostromo crew first encountered the Alien eggs, and that he hopes to return Alien specimens to the company laboratories where he can profit from their use as biological weapons. She threatens to expose him, but Bishop soon informs the group of a greater threat: the damaged processing station has become unstable and will soon detonate with the force of a thermonuclear weapon. He volunteers to use the colony's transmitter to pilot the Sulaco's remaining dropship to the surface by remote control so that the group can escape. Ripley and Newt fall asleep in the medical laboratory, awakening to find themselves locked in the room with the two facehuggers, which have been released from their tanks. Ripley is able to alert the marines, who rescue them and kill the creatures. Ripley accuses Burke of attempting to smuggle implanted Alien embryos past Earth's quarantine inside her and Newt, and of planning to kill the rest of the marines in hypersleep during the return trip so that no one could contradict his version of events. The electricity is suddenly cut off and numerous Aliens attack through the ceiling. Hudson, Burke, Gorman, and Vasquez are killed while Newt is captured by the Aliens. Ripley and an injured Hicks reach Bishop and the second dropship, but Ripley refuses to leave Newt behind. She rescues Newt from the hive in the processing station, where the two encounter the Alien queen and her egg chamber. Ripley destroys most of the eggs, enraging the queen, who escapes by tearing free from her ovipositor. Closely pursued by the queen, Ripley and Newt rendezvous with Bishop and Hicks on the dropship and escape moments before the colony is consumed by the nuclear blast. Back on the Sulaco, Ripley and Bishop's relief at their escape is interrupted when the Alien queen, stowed away on the dropship's landing gear, impales Bishop and tears him in half. Ripley battles the queen using an exosuit cargo-loader, before expelling it into space through an airlock. Ripley, Newt, Hicks and the still-functioning Bishop then enter hypersleep for the return to Earth.android extraterrestrial technology space marine spaceman cryogenics vacuum space colony warrior woman settler space travel colony alien xenomorph",False,tt0090605,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,183316455,0,0,8.908997567567567,2.3644495162840293,93931801.0,104931801.0,,,65596420.0,75939420.0,93931801.0,7,104931801.0,1.0,71971200.0,2.0,78371200.0,1.0,,0.0,,,71971200.0,2.0,78371200.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,5888480.5,13888480.5,2.0,-10480540.0,16519460.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,71971200.0,78371200.0,1.0,,,,31084792.2,57884792.2,5.0,,,,71971200.0,78371200.0,1.0,,,,24000385.0,43333718.333333336,3.0,87241466.0,118074799.33333333,3.0,26836146.333333332,34769479.666666664,3.0,56533457.0,65133457.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,149913587.33333334,178413587.33333334,3.0,,,,122427960.0,152427960.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,49895013.25,61573763.25,4.0,93931801.0,104931801.0,87224733.66666667,79291400.33333333,1.375,1.0,55214818.96773516

Bond kills a test subject, and later the 'real' Blofeld, by drowning him in a pool of superheated mud. While assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd systematically kill several diamond smugglers, M suspects that South African diamonds may be being stockpiled to depress prices by dumping, and orders Bond to uncover the smuggling ring. Disguised as professional smuggler and murderer Peter Franks, Bond travels to Amsterdam to meet contact Tiffany Case. The real Franks shows up on the way, but Bond intercepts and kills him and switches IDs to make it seem like Franks is Bond. Case and Bond then go to Los Angeles, smuggling the diamonds inside Franks' corpse. At the airport Bond meets his CIA ally Felix Leiter and goes to a funeral home, where Franks' body is cremated and the diamonds passed onto the next smuggler, Shady Tree. Bond is nearly killed by Wint and Kidd when they put him in a cremation oven, but Tree stops the process when he discovers that the diamonds in Franks' body were fakes, planted by Bond and the CIA. Bond tells Leiter to ship the real diamonds as he goes to Las Vegas. There Bond goes to the Whyte House, a casino-hotel owned by the reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte, where Tree works as a stand-up comedian. Then Bond discovers Tree has been killed by Wint and Kidd, who did not know that the diamonds were fake. At the craps table, Bond meets the opportunistic Plenty O' Toole, and after gambling, brings her to his room. Gang members are waiting there and throw O'Toole out the window and into the pool. After they leave, Bond spends the rest of the night with Tiffany Case. Bond then tells Tiffany, who wants to steal the diamonds for herself, to retrieve the diamonds at the Circus Circus casino. Tiffany picks up the diamonds, but reneges on her deal and flees, passing off the diamonds to the next smuggler. However, seeing that O'Toole was killed after being mistaken for her, Tiffany changes her mind and drives Bond to the airport, where the diamonds are given to Bert Saxby. Following Saxby's van, Bond eventually enters the car which drives to a remote facility. Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds – a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where he finds that a satellite is being built by a laser refraction specialist, Professor Dr. Metz. When Bond's cover is blown, he escapes by stealing a moon buggy and reunites with Tiffany. Bond and Tiffany return to the Whyte House. Bond scales the walls to the top floor to confront Whyte. Inside, 007 is instead confronted by two identical Blofelds who use an electronic device to sound like Whyte. Bond kills one of the Blofelds, but it turns out to be a look-alike. He is then knocked out by gas, where he is picked up by Wint and Kidd and taken out to Las Vegas Valley where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. After Bond escapes, he calls Blofeld posing as Saxby. He finds out Whyte's location and rescues him, but in the meantime Blofeld abducts Case. With the help of Whyte, Bond raids the lab and uncovers Blofeld's plot to create a laser satellite using the diamonds, which by now is already in orbit. With the satellite, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the Soviet Union and the United States, then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy. Whyte identifies an oil rig off the coast of Baja California as Blofeld's base of operations. After Bond's attempt to change the cassette containing the satellite control codes fails due to a mistake by Tiffany, Leiter and the CIA begin a helicopter attack on the rig. Blofeld tries to escape on a mini-sub, but Bond gains control of it, crashing it into the control room, causing the satellite control and base to be destroyed. Bond and Tiffany then head for Britain on a cruise ship, where Bond also foils Wint and Kidd's attempt to kill them with a hidden bomb.spy amsterdam, netherlands fight secret organization satellite secret agent plastic surgery smuggling murder extortion las vegas violence millionaire fingerprint dirt bike casino owner old woman murdered high dive gender disguise aftercreditsstinger master villain",False,tt0066995,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,116019547,1,0,15.113825972222225,9.732470303796497,70216460.75,74960210.75,95197460.83333333,99689127.5,95197460.83333333,99689127.5,82812545.33333333,9,86463378.66666667,6.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,86172460.83333333,91089127.5,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,122381062.0,124881062.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,95197460.83333333,99689127.5,6.0,75474493.0,81974493.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85290355.8,89340355.8,5.0,,,,75474493.0,81974493.0,1.0,,,,69873414.16666667,72590914.16666667,6.0,,,,,,,95197460.83333333,99689127.5,86463378.66666667,82812545.33333333,1.125,6.0,65437336.942640275

It is believed that it was sent by famed assassin Francisco Scaramanga, who uses a golden gun, to intimidate the agent. Because of the perceived threat to the agent's life, M relieves Bond of a mission revolving around the work of a scientist named Gibson, thought to be in possession of information crucial to solving the energy crisis with solar power. Bond sets out unofficially to find Scaramanga. After retrieving a spent golden bullet from a belly dancer in Beirut and tracking its manufacturer to Macau, Bond sees Andrea Anders, Scaramanga's mistress, collecting golden bullets at a casino. Bond follows her to Hong Kong and in her Peninsula Hotel room pressures her to tell him about Scaramanga, his appearance and his plans; she directs him to the Bottoms Up Club. The club proves to be the location of Scaramanga's next 'hit', Gibson, from which Scaramanga's dwarf henchman Nick Nack steals the ""Solex agitator"", a key component of a solar power station. Before Bond can assert his innocence, however, Lieutenant Hip escorts him away from the scene, taking him to meet M and Q in a hidden headquarters in the wreck of the {{RMS}} in the harbour. M assigns 007 to retrieve the Solex agitator and assassinate Scaramanga. Bond then travels to Bangkok to meet Hai Fat, a wealthy Thai entrepreneur suspected of arranging Gibson's murder. Bond poses as Scaramanga, but his plan backfires because Scaramanga himself is being hosted at Hai Fat's estate. Bond is captured and placed in Fat's dojo, where the fighters are instructed to kill him. After escaping with the aid of Lt. Hip and his nieces, Bond speeds away on a khlong along the river and reunites with his British assistant Mary Goodnight. Hai Fat is subsequently killed by Scaramanga, who replaces Fat as the ""new Chairman of the board"" and takes the Solex. Anders visits Bond, revealing that she had sent the bullet to London and wants Bond to kill Scaramanga. In payment, she promises to hand the Solex over to him at a boxing venue the next day. At the match, Bond discovers Anders dead and meets Scaramanga. Bond spots the Solex on the floor and is able to smuggle it away to Hip, who passes it to Goodnight. Attempting to place a homing device on Scaramanga's car, she is locked into the vehicle's boot. Bond sees Scaramanga driving away and steals a showroom car to give chase, coincidentally with Sheriff J.W. Pepper seated within it. Bond and Pepper follow Scaramanga in a car chase across Bangkok, which concludes when Scaramanga's car transforms into a plane, which flies him, Nick Nack and Goodnight to his private island. Picking up Goodnight's tracking device, Bond flies a seaplane into Red Chinese waters, under the Chinese radar, and lands at Scaramanga's island. On arriving, Bond is welcomed by Scaramanga, who shows him the high-tech solar power plant he has taken over, the technology for which he intends to sell to the highest bidder. Whilst demonstrating the equipment, Scaramanga uses a powerful solar beam to destroy Bond's plane. Scaramanga then proposes a pistol duel with Bond on the beach; the two men later stand back to back and are ordered by Nick Nack to take twenty paces, but when Bond turns and fires, Scaramanga has vanished. Nick Nack leads Bond into Scaramanga's Funhouse where Bond poses as a mannequin of himself while Scaramanga walks by, taking him by surprise and killing him. Goodnight, in waylaying a Scaramanga henchman into a pool of liquid helium, upsets the balance of the solar plant, which begins to go out of control. Bond retrieves the Solex unit just before the island explodes, and they escape unharmed in Scaramanga's Chinese junk, later subduing Nick Nack who challenges them having smuggled himself aboard.london, england england martial arts assassin based on novel or book exotic island gold hitman secret mission villain bangkok thailand floatplane karate hong kong duel secret service aftercreditsstinger",True,tt0071807,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,97572000,1,0,12.938857142857144,29.282784630558766,82532906.9,87747906.9,104347768.5,109491518.5,104347768.5,109491518.5,154777836.0,1,161777836.0,1.0,-4207721.0,8.0,932468.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,154777836.0,1.0,161777836.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,89407758.85714285,94650616.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,128659481.66666667,134226148.33333334,3.0,39885000.0,71000000.0,1.0,115838300.5,120338300.5,2.0,,,,104347768.5,109491518.5,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,131798691.5,138898691.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85354733.5,89167858.5,8.0,,,,,,,104347768.5,109491518.5,108162713.5,101782650.33333333,1.25,1.3333333333333333,90106781.91396041

As the day of his execution comes closer and closer, Poncelet asks Sister Helen to help him with a final appeal. She decides to visit him, and he comes across as arrogant, sexist, and racist, not even pretending to feel any kind of remorse. Instead he affirms his innocence, insisting it was Vitello who killed the two teenagers. Convincing an experienced attorney to take on Poncelet's case pro bono, Sister Helen tries to obtain life imprisonment for Poncelet. Over time, after many visits, she establishes a special relationship with him. At the same time, she gets to know Poncelet’s mother, Lucille, and the victims’ families. The families do not understand Sister Helen's efforts to help Poncelet, claiming she is ""taking his side"". Instead they desire ""absolute justice"", namely his life for the lives of their children. Sister Helen’s application for a pardon is declined. Poncelet asks Sister Helen to be his spiritual advisor through the day of execution, and she agrees. Sister Helen tells Poncelet that his redemption is possible only if he takes responsibility for what he did. Just before he is taken from his cell, Poncelet admits to Sister Helen that he killed the boy and raped the girl. During his execution, he appeals to the boy's parents for forgiveness and tells the girl's parents he hopes his death brings them peace. Poncelet is then executed and later given a proper burial. The murdered boy's father attends the ceremony and begins to pray with Sister Helen, ending the film.prison rape nun socially deprived family penalty death penalty despair death row therapist self-discovery prison cell court case death sentence doomed man sentence lethal injection forgiveness charity mercy petition rage and hate unsociability right and justice court cowardliness",False,tt0112818,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,39363635,0,0,2.5785122727272727,2.52164293872272,,,133142304.0,163023637.33333334,36875064.0,49233064.0,111692319.0,20,112892319.0,1.0,-14685000.0,9.0,2315000.0,1.0,-2338243.0,12.0,3661757.0,1.0,,0.0,,,29357676.0,8.0,46357676.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,55626225.0,71698225.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-9693796.333333334,7972870.333333333,3.0,,,,,,,,,41306688.0,31006688.0,6.125,1.0,104897737.26798174

James Bond  is summoned to investigate. On the way, he escapes an ambush by Soviet agents in Austria, killing one during a downhill ski chase, and escaping via a Union Flag parachute. Bond learns that the plans for a highly advanced submarine tracking system are on the market in Egypt. There, he encounters Major Anya Amasova  of the KGB, his rival for the plans. Bond and Amasova team up, due to a truce supported by their respective superiors. They travel across Egypt together, tracking the microfilm plans, meeting Jaws – an unnaturally tall assassin with steel teeth – along the way. They later identify the person responsible for the thefts as shipping tycoon, scientist and anarchist Karl Stromberg. While travelling by train to Stromberg's base in Sardinia, Bond saves Amasova from being attacked by Jaws, and their rivalry changes into affection. They visit Stromberg's base and learn of his mysterious new supertanker, the Liparus. Jaws, and other henchmen, chase the couple's car, but they escape, due to Bond's superior driving skills and his Q Branch Lotus Esprit sports car/submarine. This unique car enables the two spies to perform a further underwater reconnaissance of Stromberg's facilities. Bond later finds out that the Liparus has never visited any known port or harbour, and Amasova learns that Bond killed her lover in Austria; she promises Bond that she will kill him when their mission ends. Later, while aboard an American submarine, Bond and Amasova examine Stromberg's underwater Atlantis base and confirm that he is operating the tracking system. The Liparus then captures the submarine, just as it captured the others. Stromberg sets his plan in motion: the launching of nuclear missiles from the submarines, to destroy Moscow and New York City. This would trigger a global nuclear war, which Stromberg would survive in Atlantis, and subsequently a new civilisation would be established. He leaves for Atlantis with Amasova. Bond frees the captured British, Russian and American submariners and they battle the Liparus{{'}}s crew. Bond reprograms the British and Soviet submarines to destroy each other, saving Moscow and New York. The victorious submariners escape the sinking Liparus on the American submarine. Bond insists on rescuing Amasova before the submarine has to follow its orders and destroy Atlantis. Bond confronts and kills Stromberg but again encounters Jaws, whom he drops into a shark tank. Bond and Amasova flee in an escape pod as Atlantis is sunk. In the pod Amasova reminds Bond that she has vowed to kill him and picks up Bond's gun, but admits to having forgiven him and the two make love. The Royal Navy recovers the pod, and the two spies are seen in intimate embrace through its large window, much to the consternation of Bond and Amasova's superiors.

The hotel itself is built on the site of a Native American burial ground and becomes completely snowed in during the long winters. Manager Stuart Ullman  warns him that a previous caretaker developed cabin fever and killed his family and himself. Jack's son, Danny , has ESP and has had a terrifying premonition about the hotel. Jack's wife, Wendy , tells a visiting doctor that Danny has an imaginary friend called Tony and that Jack has given up drinking because he had hurt Danny's arm after a binge. The family arrives at the hotel on closing day and is given a tour. The African-AmericanHallorann's race is of much greater significance in King's novel IT than in this story, although in the film the ghost butler and Jack Torrance refer to Hallorann using racial slurs . African-Americans with supernatural powers are a recurring motif in King's novels. chef Dick Hallorann  surprises Danny by telepathically offering him ice cream. He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared this telepathic ability, which he calls ""shining"". Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237. Hallorann tells Danny that the hotel itself has a ""shine"" to it along with many memories, not all of which are good. He also tells Danny to stay out of Room 237. A month passes; while Jack's writing project goes nowhere, Danny and Wendy explore the hotel's hedge maze. Wendy becomes concerned about the phone lines being out due to the heavy snowfall and Danny has more frightening visions. Jack, increasingly frustrated, starts acting strangely and becomes prone to violent outbursts. Danny's curiosity about Room 237 gets the better of him when he sees the room's door open. Later, he shows up injured and visibly traumatized, causing Wendy to accuse Jack of abusing Danny. Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd . Lloyd serves him bourbon on the rocks while Jack complains to him about his marriage. Wendy later tells Jack that Danny told her that a ""crazy woman in one of the rooms"" was responsible for his injuries. Jack investigates Room 237 where he encounters the ghost of a dead woman, but tells Wendy he saw nothing. Wendy and Jack argue about whether Danny should be removed from the hotel and a furious Jack returns to the Gold Room, now filled with ghosts having a costume party. Here, he meets the ghost of the previous caretaker, Grady , who tells Jack that he must ""correct"" his wife and child. Meanwhile, in Florida, Hallorann has a premonition that something is wrong at the hotel and takes a flight back to Colorado to investigate. Danny starts calling out ""redrum"" frantically and goes into a trance, now referring to himself as ""Tony"".{{anchor}} While searching for Jack, Wendy discovers his typewriter; he has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating ""all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" formatted in various styles. She is confronted by Jack, who threatens her before she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat. She manages to drag him into the kitchen and lock him in the pantry, but this does not solve her larger problem; she and Danny are trapped at the hotel since Jack has sabotaged the hotel's two-way radio and snowcat. Later, Jack converses through the pantry door with Grady, who then unlocks the door, releasing him. Danny writes ""REⱭЯUM"" in lipstick on the bathroom door. When Wendy sees this in the bedroom mirror, the letters spell out ""MURDƎЯ"".In both forwards and backwards orientations, two of the six letters are displayed backwards, the middle DR for REDRUM and the final ER for MURDER. Jack begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters with a fire axe. Wendy frantically sends Danny out through the bathroom window, but can't get through it herself. Jack then starts chopping through the bathroom door as Wendy screams in horror; he leers through the hole he has made, shouting ""Here's Johnny!"", but backs off after Wendy slashes his hand with a butcher knife. Hearing the engine of the snowcat Hallorann has borrowed to get up the mountain, Jack leaves the room. He kills Hallorann in the lobby and pursues Danny into the hedge maze. Wendy runs through the hotel looking for Danny, encountering several ghosts and a huge cascade of blood from an elevator. Meanwhile, Danny walks backwards in his own tracks and leaps behind a corner, covering his tracks with snow to mislead Jack, who is following his footprints. Wendy and Danny escape in Hallorann's snowcat, while Jack freezes to death in the hedge maze.

En route in a small plane, on an unrelated case, Bond is attacked by the pilot and crew and is pushed out of the plane by the mercenary assassin Jaws. Bond survives by stealing a parachute from the pilot, whilst Jaws lands on a circus tent. Bond proceeds to the Drax Industries shuttle-manufacturing complex where he meets the owner of the company, Hugo Drax, and henchman Chang. Bond also meets an astronaut, Dr. Holly Goodhead and survives an assassination attempt via a centrifuge chamber. Bond is later aided by Drax's personal pilot, Corinne Dufour, as he finds blueprints for a glass vial made in Venice. Bond then foils another attempt on his life, using a hunting shotgun to shoot a sniper. Upon discovering that Dufour assisted Bond's investigations, Drax has her killed. Bond again encounters Goodhead in Venice where he is chased through the canals by Drax's henchmen. He discovers a secret biological laboratory, and by accidentally poisoning the scientists there, he learns that the glass vials are to hold a nerve gas deadly to humans, but harmless to animals. Chang attacks Bond and is killed, but during the fight, Bond finds evidence that Drax is moving his operation to Rio de Janeiro. Rejoining Goodhead, he deduces that she is a CIA agent spying on Drax. They promise to work together, but quickly dispense with the truce. Bond has saved one of the vials he found earlier, as the only evidence of the now-empty laboratory, giving it to M for analysis, who permits him to go to Rio de Janeiro. In Rio, Bond meets his Brazilian contact Manuela. Drax hires Jaws to finish Chang's job of eliminating Bond. Bond meets Goodhead at the top of Sugarloaf Mountain, where they are attacked by Jaws on a cable car. After Jaws' car crashes he is rescued by Dolly from the rubble, and the two fall in love. Bond and Goodhead are captured by henchmen, but Bond escapes and reports to an MI6 base in Brazil and learns that the toxin comes from a rare orchid indigenous to the Amazon jungle. Bond travels the Amazon River looking for Drax's research facility and again encounters Jaws and other henchmen. Bond escapes from his boat just before it hits the Iguazu Falls, and finds Drax's base. Captured by Jaws again, Bond is taken to Drax and witnesses four Moonrakers lifting off. Drax explains that he stole the Moonraker because another in the fleet had developed a fault during assembly. Bond is reunited with Goodhead; they escape and successfully pose as pilots on the sixth shuttle. The shuttles dock with Drax's hidden space station.  Drax plans to destroy human life by launching fifty globes containing the toxin into the Earth's atmosphere. Before launching them, Drax also transported several dozen genetically perfect young men and women of varying races, to the space station. They would live there until Earth was safe again for human life; their descendants would be the seed for a ""new master race"". Bond persuades Jaws and Dolly to switch their allegiance by getting Drax to admit that anyone not measuring up to his physical standards would be exterminated and Jaws attacks Drax's guards. Before the battle Drax launched three of the globes towards Earth, which Goodhead and Bond destroy from their shuttle then Bond and Goodhead disable the radar jammer hiding the station from Earth. The US sends a platoon of Marines in a military shuttle. A laser battle ensues in which Drax's guards as well as his new master race die. During the battle, Bond shoots Drax with a cyanide-tipped dart, then pushes him into an airlock and ejects him into space. The space station, heavily damaged in the battle, disintegrates. Jaws helps Bond and Goodhead escape in Drax's space shuttle.

The spy boat St Georges, which holds the Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator , the system used by the Ministry of Defence to communicate with and co-ordinate the Royal Navy's fleet of Polaris submarines, was sunk by a naval mine in the Ionian Sea. Bond is asked to retrieve the ATAC before the Soviets, as the transmitter could order attacks by the Polaris submarines' ballistic missiles. The head of the KGB, General Gogol had already sent a contact to Greece. A marine archaeologist, Sir Timothy Havelock, who had been asked by the British to secretly locate the St Georges, is murdered with his wife by a Cuban hitman, Hector Gonzales. Bond goes to Spain to find out who hired Gonzales. While spying on Gonzales' villa, Bond is captured by his men, but manages to escape as Gonzales is shot with an arrow. Outside, he finds the assassin was Melina Havelock, the daughter of Sir Timothy and the two escape. With the help of Q, Bond identifies a hitman in Gonzales' estate as Emile Leopold Locque, and then goes to Locque's possible base in Italy. There Bond meets his contact, Luigi Ferrara, and a well-connected Greek businessman and intelligence informant, Aris Kristatos, who tells Bond that Locque is employed by Milos Columbo, Kristatos' former organised crime partner. After Bond goes with Kristatos' protégée, figure skater Bibi Dahl, to a biathlon course, a group of three men which include East German biathlete Eric Kriegler chases Bond trying to kill him. Once he escapes, Bond goes with Ferrara to an indoor ice rink to bid Bibi farewell. After she leaves, three men in hockey gear attempt to kill Bond, but again he manages to fend them off. When Bond returns to his car, Ferrara is dead, with a dove  pin in his hand. Bond then travels to Corfu in pursuit of Columbo. At a nightclub, he meets with Kristatos and asks how to meet Columbo, not knowing that Columbo's men are secretly recording their conversation. After Columbo and his mistress, Countess Lisl von Schlaf, argue, Bond offers to escort her home. Eventually, Lisl reveals that Columbo knows Bond is a secret agent, and that she was sent by him to find out more info on Bond. Not knowing Apostis overheard the conversation, the two then spend the night together. In the morning Lisl and Bond are ambushed and Lisl is killed. Before they can attack Bond, he is captured by men working for Columbo. When Columbo and Bond meet, Columbo tells him that Locque was actually hired by Kristatos, who is working for the KGB to retrieve the ATAC. Bond accompanies Columbo and his crew on a raid at one of Kristatos' opium-processing warehouses in Albania, where Bond uncovers naval mines similar to the one that sank the St. Georges, suggesting it was not an accident. After the base is destroyed, Bond chases Locque and kills him. Afterwards, Bond meets with Melina, and they recover the ATAC from the wreckage of the St Georges, but Kristatos is waiting for them when they surface and he takes the ATAC. After the two escape an assassination attempt, they discover Kristatos' rendezvous point when Melina's parrot repeats the phrase ""ATAC to St. Cyril's"". With the help of Columbo and his men, Bond and Melina break into abandoned mountaintop monastery, St. Cyril's. While Bond is climbing, Apostis attacks him, but is killed. As Columbo confronts Kristatos, Bond disposes of the biathlete Kriegler. Bond retrieves the ATAC system and stops Melina from killing Kristatos after he surrenders. Kristatos tries to kill Bond with a hidden switchblade, but is killed by a knife thrown by Columbo. Gogol arrives by helicopter to collect the ATAC, but Bond destroys it first, saying ""Détente, comrade. You don't have it; I don't have it.""

MI6 immediately suspects Soviet involvement and sends James Bond—agent 007—to investigate, after seeing the real egg appear at an auction in London, ordering the agent to find out who the seller is. At the auction, Bond is able to swap the real egg with the fake, and engages in a bidding war with exiled Afghan prince, Kamal Khan, forcing Khan to pay £500,000 for the fake egg. Bond follows Khan back to his palace in Rajasthan, India, where Bond defeats Khan in a game of backgammon. Bond escapes with his Indian colleague Vijay, evading Khan's bodyguard Gobinda's attempts to kill them both. Bond is seduced by one of Khan's associates, Magda , and notices that she has a blue-ringed octopus tattoo. Magda steals a fake Fabergé egg fitted with a listening device by Q, while Gobinda captures Bond and takes him to Khan's palace. After Bond escapes from his cell he listens in on the bug in the Faberge egg and discovers that Khan is working with Orlov, a renegade Soviet general, who is seeking to expand Soviet borders into Europe. After escaping the palace, Bond infiltrates a floating palace in Udaipur, India, and there finds its owner, Octopussy, a wealthy woman who leads the Octopus cult, of which Magda is a part. In Octopussy's palace, Bond finds out that Orlov has been supplying Khan with priceless Soviet treasures, replacing them with replicas, while Khan has been smuggling the real versions into the West, via Octopussy's circus troupe. Orlov is planning to meet Khan at Karl-Marx-Stadt in East Germany, where the circus is scheduled to perform. After evading Khan's assassins, Bond goes to East Germany. Bond infiltrates the circus, and finds that Orlov replaced the Soviet treasures with a nuclear warhead, primed to explode during the circus show at a US Air Force base in West Germany. The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament, in the belief that the bomb was a US one that detonated by accident, leaving its borders open to Soviet invasion. Bond takes Orlov's car, drives it along the train tracks and boards the moving circus train. Orlov is shot dead by GDR guards, while trying to cross the border. Bond kills the twin knife-throwers, Mischka and Grischka, in revenge for 009's death, and, after falling from the train, commandeers a car, in order to get to the Air Force base. At the base, Bond disguises himself as a clown to evade the West German police. He attempts to convince Octopussy that Khan has betrayed her, by showing her one of the treasures, found in Orlov's car, that she was to smuggle for him. Octopussy realises that she has been tricked and assists Bond in deactivating the warhead. Bond and Octopussy return to India and launch an assault on Khan's palace. Khan and Gobinda flee the palace, capturing Octopussy in the process. Bond follows them as they attempt to escape in an aeroplane, clinging to the fuselage and disabling one of its engines. Gobinda dies after falling off the roof of the plane and Bond rescues Octopussy from Khan, the pair jumping onto a nearby cliff moments before the plane crashes into a mountain, killing Khan. While M and General Gogol discuss the return of the jewellery, Bond recuperates with Octopussy, aboard her private boat in India.circus atomic bomb eastern block octopus crocodile clown secret intelligence service kgb snake charmer hot air balloon tiger east berlin india knife throwing british secret service",False,tt0086034,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,187500000,1,0,5.8181818181818175,6.872979369498223,120034476.83333333,130380310.16666667,93533999.375,103668374.375,34660261.666666664,41917261.666666664,152081882.0,10,170081882.0,5.0,90572000.0,9.0,97572000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,78794037.36363636,89584946.45454545,11.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,167312802.0,195312802.0,1.0,,,,9041631.0,23041631.0,2.0,167312802.0,195312802.0,1.0,120034476.83333333,130380310.16666667,12.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,115407350.42857143,123900207.57142857,7.0,167312802.0,195312802.0,1.0,167312802.0,195312802.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,88088893.5,103338893.5,2.0,,,,,,,120034476.83333333,130380310.16666667,133826941.0,121326941.0,2.375,3.0,70929371.26798174

He succeeds, but is ambushed and flees in a submarine disguised as an iceberg. Q analyses the microchip, establishing it to be a copy of one designed to withstand an electromagnetic pulse and made by government contractor Zorin Industries. Bond visits Ascot Racecourse to observe the company's owner, Max Zorin. Zorin's horse wins a race but proves hard to control. Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a horse trainer and MI6 agent, believes Zorin's horse was drugged although tests proved negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets French private detective Achille Aubergine who informs Bond that Zorin is holding a horse sale later in the month. During their dinner at the Eiffel Tower, Aubergine is assassinated by Zorin's bodyguard May Day, who jumps off of the tower with a parachute. Bond chases, but fails to apprehend her. Bond and Tibbett travel to Chantilly, France to stay at Zorin's estate for the horse sale. Bond is puzzled by a woman who rebuffs him and finds out that Zorin has paid her a very large sum of money. At night, Bond and Tibbett break into Zorin's laboratory learning that he is implanting adrenaline-releasing devices in his horses. Zorin identifies Bond as an agent, has May Day assassinate Tibbett and then attempts to have Bond killed too. General Gogol of the KGB confronts Zorin for killing Bond without permission revealing that Zorin was initially trained and financed by the KGB, but has now gone rogue. Zorin unveils to a group of investors his plan to destroy Silicon Valley which will give him – and his potential investors – a monopoly over microchip manufacture. Bond goes to San Francisco where he learns from CIA agent Chuck Lee that Zorin could be the product of medical experimentation with steroids performed by a Nazi scientist, now Zorin's henchman Dr. Carl Mortner, who took refuge in the Soviet Union after World War II. He then investigates a nearby oil rig owned by Zorin and while there finds KGB agent Pola Ivanova recording conversations and her partner placing explosives on the rig. Ivanova's partner is caught and killed, but Ivanova and Bond escape. During an evening together Ivanova takes the recording but later finds out that Bond had switched tapes leaving her with a recording of traditional Japanese music. Bond tracks down the woman Zorin attempted to pay off, State Geologist Stacey Sutton, and posing as a journalist he establishes that Zorin is trying to buy her family oil business, then later rescues her from Zorin henchmen during an intimidation attempt on her. The two travel to San Francisco City Hall to check Zorin's plans, however Zorin is alerted to their presence and arrives only to kill the Chief Geologist with Bond's gun, then set fire to the building in order to both frame Bond for the murder and kill him at the same time. Bond and Sutton escape from the fire, but when the police try to arrest Bond, they escape in a fire engine. Bond and Sutton infiltrate Zorin's mine, discovering his plot to detonate explosives beneath the lakes along the Hayward Fault and the San Andreas Fault, which will cause them to flood. A larger bomb is also on site in the mine to destroy a ""geological lock"" that prevents the two faults from moving at the same time. Zorin and his security chief Scarpine flood the mines and murder the mine workers. Sutton escapes while Bond fights May Day; when she realises Zorin abandoned her, she helps Bond remove the larger bomb, putting the device onto a handcar and pushing it out of the mine. May Day stays on the car to hold the faulty brake lever, sacrificing herself as the bomb explodes. Zorin, who had escaped in his airship with Scarpine and Mortner, abducts Sutton. Bond grabs hold of the mooring rope as the airship ascends. Zorin tries to kill Bond by flying him into the Transamerica Pyramid, then the Golden Gate Bridge, but Bond manages to moor the airship to the bridge framework. Stacey attacks Zorin and in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Stacey flees and joins Bond, but Zorin attacks them with an axe. The ensuing fight culminates with Bond sending Zorin falling to his death. Finally, Mortner attacks Bond using sticks of dynamite, but drops a stick in the cabin, blowing up the airship and killing himself and Scarpine. In the aftermath, Q sends out a remote sensing robot to track down Bond – who has been missing since the airship exploded – and finds him with Sutton in her shower. Bond sees the device and throws a towel over the mounted camera, much to Q's exasperation.paris, france london, england france england san francisco, california horse race fire helicopter drug abuse terrorist secret identity fire engine villain ascot silicon valley zeppelin earthquake snowboarding microchip doping racehorse flooding pipeline snow british secret service snow skiing firefighter",False,tt0090264,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,152427960,1,0,4.080932,0.8905496399261349,123108747.84615384,134774132.46153846,52565938.571428575,62714795.71428572,87812419.78947368,99004525.05263157,130557342.28571428,12,148914485.14285713,7.0,35000000.0,7.0,50000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,85561200.91666667,97744534.25,12.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,163656401.0,191406401.0,2.0,,,,40424181.0,60549181.0,4.0,,,,123108747.84615384,134774132.46153846,13.0,,,,160000000.0,187500000.0,1.0,69648219.0,100898219.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,120981431.625,131850181.625,8.0,163656401.0,191406401.0,2.0,163656401.0,191406401.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,78868556.25,102118556.25,4.0,,,,,,,123172408.71428572,136575980.14285713,99457242.57142857,82778671.14285713,2.375,4.0,51342232.19105865

During the mission, Bond notices that the KGB sniper assigned to prevent Koskov's escape is a female cellist from the orchestra. Disobeying his orders to kill the sniper, he instead shoots the rifle from her hands, then uses the Trans-Siberian Pipeline to smuggle Koskov across the border into Austria and then on to Britain. In his post-defection debriefing, Koskov informs MI6 that the KGB's old policy of Smert Spionam, meaning Death to Spies, has been revived by General Leonid Pushkin, the new head of the KGB. Koskov is later abducted from the safe-house and assumed to have been taken back to Moscow. Bond is directed to track down Pushkin in Tangier and kill him in order to forestall further killings of agents and escalation of tensions between the Soviet Union and the West. Although Bond's prior knowledge of Pushkin initially leads him to doubt Koskov's claims, he agrees to carry out the mission when he learns that the assassin who killed 004  left a note bearing the same message, ""Smert Spionam."" Bond returns to Bratislava to track down the cellist, Kara Milovy. He determines that Koskov's entire defection was staged, and that Milovy is actually Koskov's girlfriend. Bond convinces Milovy that he is a friend of Koskov's and persuades her to accompany him to Vienna, supposedly to be reunited with him. Meanwhile, Pushkin meets with arms dealer Brad Whitaker in Tangier, informing him that the KGB is cancelling an arms deal previously arranged between Koskov and Whitaker. During his brief tryst with Milovy in Vienna, Bond meets his MI6 ally, Saunders, who discovers a history of financial dealings between Koskov and Whitaker. As he leaves their meeting, Saunders is killed by Necros , who again leaves the message ""Smert Spionam."" Bond and Milovy promptly leave for Tangier, where Bond confronts Pushkin. Pushkin disavows any knowledge of ""Smert Spionam"", and reveals that Koskov is evading arrest for embezzlement of government funds. Bond fakes Pushkin's assassination, inducing Whitaker and Koskov to progress with their scheme. Meanwhile, Milovy contacts Koskov, who tells her that Bond is actually a KGB agent and convinces her to drug him so he can be captured. Koskov, Necros, Milovy, and the captive Bond fly to a Soviet air base in Afghanistan—part of the Soviet war in Afghanistan—where Koskov betrays Milovy and imprisons her along with Bond. The pair escape and in doing so free a condemned prisoner, Kamran Shah, leader of the local Mujahideen. Bond and Milovy discover that Koskov is using Soviet funds to buy a massive shipment of opium from the Mujahideen, intending to keep the profits with enough left over to supply the Soviets with their arms. With the Mujahideen's help, Bond plants a bomb aboard the cargo plane carrying the opium, but is spotted and has no choice but to barricade himself in the plane. Milovy drives a jeep into the back of the plane as they take off, and Necros also leaps aboard at the last second. After a struggle, Bond throws Necros to his death and deactivates the bomb. Bond then re-activates it and drops it out of the plane and onto a bridge, blowing it up and helping Shah and his men gain an important victory over advancing Soviet troops. Bond returns to Tangier to kill Whitaker, as Pushkin arrests Koskov, sending him back to Moscow.london, england arms smuggling prison england assassination spy falsely accused secret identity country estate arms deal russia drug traffic secret mission secret intelligence service kgb villain renegade special car tangier morocco big wheel pipeline cello orchestra freedom fighter czechoslovakia bratislava afghanistan airplane schloss schönbrunn escape vienna, austria moscow",False,tt0093428,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,191185897,1,0,3.779647425,2.4643612765605467,89543196.8,101675696.8,123060120.14285715,136035120.14285713,120034476.83333333,130380310.16666667,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,88397105.46153846,101950951.61538461,13.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,149913587.33333334,178413587.33333334,3.0,,,,47619371.5,66179371.5,6.0,,,,123060120.14285715,136035120.14285713,14.0,122427960.0,152427960.0,1.0,47215421.333333336,73215421.33333333,3.0,106635213.25,134385213.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,121142157.0,134136601.44444445,9.0,47969801.333333336,56009801.333333336,3.0,153639304.25,179639304.25,4.0,,,,-13862199.0,11137801.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,123122778.8,137632778.8,,,0.0,,65482750.456980206

Bond and Leiter capture Sanchez by attaching a hook and cord to Sanchez's plane in flight near The Bahamas and pulling it out of the air with a Coast Guard helicopter. Afterwards, Bond and Leiter parachute down to the church in time for the ceremony. Sanchez bribes DEA agent Ed Killifer and escapes. Meanwhile, Sanchez's henchman Dario and his crew ambush Leiter and his wife Della. Leiter is maimed by a great white shark and Della is raped and killed. When Bond returns to Leiter's house to find Della dead and Felix alive, but seriously wounded, he swears to take his revenge on Sanchez. After Bond kills Killifer by pushing him into the tank with the shark that maimed Leiter, M meets Bond in Key West's Hemingway House and orders him to an assignment in Istanbul, Turkey. Bond resigns after turning down the assignment, but M suspends Bond instead and immediately revokes his licence to kill. Bond flees from MI6 custody and becomes a rogue agent, bereft of official backing but later surreptitiously helped by MI6 armourer Q. Bond boards the Wavekrest – a ship run by Sanchez's henchman Milton Krest – and foils Sanchez's latest drug shipment, stealing five million dollars in the process. Bond recruits Pam Bouvier, an ex-CIA agent-pilot whom he rescues from Dario at a Bimini bar, and journeys with her to the Republic of Isthmus. In Isthmus City, Bond is met by Q. He finds his way into Sanchez's employment by posing as an assassin looking for work. Two Hong Kong Narcotics Bureau officers foil Bond's attempt to assassinate Sanchez and take him to an abandoned warehouse. They are joined by Fallon, an MI6 agent who was sent by M to apprehend Bond either dead or alive. Bond is about to be sedated via injection and sent back to the UK in disgrace when Sanchez's men rescue Bond and kill the officers, believing them to be the assassins. Later, with the aid of Bouvier, Q and Sanchez's girlfriend Lupe, Bond frames Krest by placing the five million dollars he had stolen into the hyperbaric chamber on board the Wavekrest. An angry Sanchez traps Krest in the chamber and then rapidly depressurises it, killing him; meanwhile, for Bond's perceived loyalty, Sanchez admits him into his inner circle. Sanchez takes Bond to his base, which is disguised as a meditation retreat. Bond learns that Sanchez's scientists can dissolve cocaine in petrol and then sell it disguised as fuel to Asian drug dealers. The buying and selling are conducted via the televangelist Professor Joe Butcher, working under orders from Sanchez's business manager Truman-Lodge. The re-integration process will be available to those underworld clients who can pay Sanchez's price. During Sanchez's presentation to potential Asian customers, Dario discovers Bond and betrays him to Sanchez. Bond starts a fire in the laboratory and attempts to flee, but is captured again and placed on the conveyor belt that drops the brick-cocaine into a giant shredder. Bouvier arrives and distracts Dario, allowing Bond to pull Dario into the shredder, killing him. Sanchez flees as fire consumes his base, taking with him four articulated tankers full of the cocaine and petrol mixture. Bond pursues them by plane, with Bouvier at the controls. During the course of the chase through the desert, three of the four tankers are destroyed. Sanchez attacks Bond aboard the final remaining tanker, which loses control and crashes down a hill side. Soaked in petrol from the leaking tanker, Sanchez attempts to kill Bond with his machete. Bond then reveals his cigarette lighter – the Leiters' gift for being the best man at their wedding – and sets Sanchez on fire, taking revenge for Felix and Della. Burning, Sanchez stumbles into the wrecked tanker causing it and him to explode. Bouvier, driving the tractor from one of the destroyed tankers, rescues Bond.

Trevelyan is shot by Colonel Arkady Ourumov, but Bond steals an aeroplane and flees from the facility as it explodes. Nine years later, Bond arrives in Monte Carlo to follow Xenia Onatopp, a suspected member of the Janus crime syndicate, who has formed a suspicious relationship with a Royal Canadian Navy admiral. She murders the admiral to allow Ourumov  to steal his identity. The next day they steal a prototype Eurocopter Tiger helicopter that can withstand an electromagnetic pulse. They fly it to a bunker in Severnaya, where they massacre the staff and steal the control disk for the dual GoldenEye satellite weapons. They program one of the GoldenEye satellites to destroy the complex with an electromagnetic pulse, and escape with programmer Boris Grishenko. Natalya Simonova, the lone survivor, contacts Boris and arranges to meet him in St. Petersburg, where he betrays her to Janus. In London, M assigns Bond to investigate the attack. Bond flies to St. Petersburg to meet CIA agent Jack Wade. He suggests Bond meet Valentin Zukovsky, a Russian Mafia head and business rival of Janus. After Bond gives him a tip on a potential heist, Zukovsky arranges a meeting between Bond and Janus. Xenia is sent to meet Bond at his hotel and attempts to kill him, but he overpowers her and she takes him to Janus. Bond meets Janus who reveals himself as none other than Alec Trevelyan, now badly scarred from the explosion at Arkhangelsk. A descendant of the Cossack clans who collaborated with the Nazi forces in World War II, Trevelyan faked his death, having vowed revenge against Britain for their involvement in his parents' deaths. Just as Bond is about to shoot Trevelyan, Bond is shot with a tranquiliser dart knocking him out. Bond awakens tied up with Natalya in the Tiger helicopter programmed to self-destruct, from which the two escape. They are immediately arrested by the Russian police and are brought to the military archives, where the Russian Minister of Defence Dimitri Mishkin interrogates them. As Natalya reveals the existence of a second satellite and Ourumov's involvement in the massacre at Severnaya, Ourumov bursts into the room, shooting Mishkin. As Ourumov calls for his guards, Bond escapes into the archives with Natalya, where a firefight ensues. Simonova is captured and is dragged into a car by Ourumov. Bond steals a tank and pursues Ourumov through St. Petersburg to Janus' armoured train, where he kills Ourumov as Trevelyan escapes and locks Bond in the train with Simonova. As the train's self-destruct countdown begins, Bond cuts through the floor with his laser watch while Simonova locates Grishenko's satellite dish in Cuba. The two escape just before the train explodes. In Cuba, Bond and Natalya meet Jack Wade and trade Bond's car for Wade's aeroplane. While flying over a Cuban jungle, Bond and Simonova are shot down. As they stumble out of the wreckage, Onatopp rappels down from a helicopter and attacks Bond. After a struggle, Bond shoots down the helicopter, resulting in the death of Onatopp. Bond and Natalya then watch a lake being drained of water, uncovering a satellite dish. They infiltrate the control station, where Bond is captured. Trevelyan reveals his plan to steal money from the Bank of England before erasing all of its financial records with the remaining GoldenEye, concealing the theft and destroying Britain's economy. Meanwhile, Simonova programs the satellite to initiate atmospheric re-entry and destroy itself. As Trevelyan captures Simonova and orders Grishenko to save the satellite, Bond triggers an explosion with his pen grenade and escapes to the antenna cradle. Bond sabotages the antenna, preventing Grishenko from regaining control of the satellite, before turning and fighting Trevelyan. The two end up on the antenna platform, five hundred feet above the dish, and Bond kicks Trevelyan off the side of the platform, but grabs him by the foot and after a brief and personal exchange, Bond lets go of Trevelyan and he falls to the bottom of the pool. The cradle explodes, resulting in the deaths of both Trevelyan and Grishenko. Meanwhile, Simonova commandeers a helicopter and flees with Bond, and the couple is then rescued by Wade and a team of Marines.cuba falsely accused secret identity computer virus secret base secret intelligence service kgb satellite special car cossack electromagnetic pulse time bomb st. petersburg, russia red army",False,tt0113189,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,352194034,1,0,5.072310931034483,2.52164293872272,124887162.125,140740287.125,86796407.75,101648491.08333333,,,22101000.0,3,32101000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,151185897.0,8.0,191185897.0,1.0,1176701.0,6.0,10176701.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,11218137.0,22718137.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,4868943.0,32868943.0,1.0,-39808601.0,7191399.0,1.0,,,,109773545.0,159773545.0,1.0,62414589.428571425,84037446.57142857,7.0,,,,,,,132593624.0,166593624.0,3.0,44882355.0,62215688.333333336,6.0,1591545.0,2451545.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,148318354.83333334,177651688.16666666,6.0,,,,87163571.0,119496904.33333333,3.0,,,,,,,,,,3842000.0,25842000.0,1.0,124834976.11764705,141873211.4117647,77821199.33333333,58154532.666666664,2.125,1.0,104897737.26798174

The first wedding is that of Angus  and Laura , at which Charles is the best man. Charles and his collection of single friends wonder if they will ever get married. At this wedding, Charles meets Carrie for the first time and spends the night with her. Carrie teases him by pretending that, now they have been to bed together, they will also have to get married, which Charles endeavours to respond to before realising she is joking. She then goes back home to America, observing that they may have missed an opportunity. The second wedding is that of Bernard  and Lydia , a couple who got together at the previous wedding. Rowan Atkinson makes his second appearance, this time as a fully fledged but gaffe-prone priest conducting his first wedding ceremony through his connection as a friend of the family. Charles is happy to discover that Carrie is attending the wedding, until she introduces him to her fiancé, Sir Hamish Banks , a wealthy politician from Scotland. At the reception, Charles finds himself seated at a table with several ex-girlfriends who relate embarrassing stories about his inability to be discreet, and afterwards bumps into Henrietta , with whom he had a difficult relationship. As the evening wears on, Charles finds himself in an empty hotel suite watching Carrie and Hamish leave in a taxicab, only to be trapped in the bath after the newlyweds suddenly stumble into the room to have sex. After Charles awkwardly exits the room, Henrietta confronts him about his habit of ""serial monogamy"", telling him that he is afraid of letting anyone get too close to him. Shortly after this encounter, Charles runs into Carrie , and they end up spending another night together. A few months later, Charles receives an invitation to Carrie's wedding in Scotland. While shopping for a present in London he accidentally bumps into Carrie in a shop and ends up helping her select her wedding dress. Carrie also astonishes him with a list of her more than thirty sexual partners . He later tries to confess his love to her and hints that he would like to have a relationship with her. However, he says it rather lamely, and the confession obviously comes too late. The third wedding is that of Carrie and Hamish at a Scottish castle. Charles attends, depressed at the prospect of Carrie's marrying Hamish. As the reception gets under way, Gareth  instructs his friends to go forth and seek potential mates; Fiona's brother, Tom , stumbles through an attempt to connect with the minister's wife, while Charles's flatmate, Scarlett , strikes up a conversation with a tall, attractive American named Chester. As Charles watches Carrie and Hamish dance as husband and wife, Charles's friend Fiona  deduces his feelings about Carrie. When Charles asks why Fiona is not married, she confesses that she has always loved Charles since they first met years ago. Charles is surprised and empathetic, but does not requite her love. At the wedding, Gareth dies suddenly of a heart attack: Gareth's partner Matthew ([[John Hannah  is in another part of the room listening to the groom's toast when Gareth dies. The funeral is that of Gareth. At the funeral, Matthew recites the poem Funeral Blues  by W. H. Auden, commemorating his relationship with Gareth.BBC Leicester: Interview with Simon Callow Retrieved 2012-05-07John Hannah Unofficial Website: John Hannah interview in The Scotsman, 17 April 2000 Retrieved 2012-05-07 After the funeral, Charles and Tom have a discussion about whether hoping to find your ""one true love"" is just a futile effort, and ponder that, while their clique have always viewed themselves as proud-to-be-single, Gareth and Matthew had in fact been a ""married"" couple among them all the while. The fourth wedding takes place ten months later, and is that of Charles, who has decided to marry Henrietta. However, moments before the ceremony, Carrie arrives at the church and reveals to Charles that she and Hamish are no longer together. Charles has a crisis of confidence, which he reveals to his deaf brother David . At the altar, when the vicar asks if anyone knows a reason why the couple should not marry, David asks Charles to translate for him, and says in sign language that he suspects the groom is having doubts and loves someone else. The vicar asks whether Charles does love someone else, and Charles replies, ""I do."" Henrietta punches Charles and the wedding is abruptly halted. Finally, Carrie visits Charles, who is recovering from the debacle, to check that he is OK and apologise for attending. Charles confesses that, while standing at the altar, he realised that for the first time in his life he totally and utterly loved one person, ""and it wasn't the person standing next to me in the veil."" Charles makes a proposal of lifelong commitment without marriage to Carrie, saying, ""Do you think not being married to me might maybe be something you could consider doing for the rest of your life?"" Carrie responds by saying, ""I do."" The song ""Going to the Chapel"" is then played as we see Henrietta marry a member of the guard, Scarlett marry Chester, David marry his girlfriend, Tom marry his distant cousin Deirdre , Matthew with a new partner , Fiona marry Prince Charles , and Charles and Carrie with their son -- presumably not married.upper class england love at first sight wedding vows marriage proposal yuppie love of one's life lone wolf snob witness bride bridegroom bridesmaid funeral clumsy fellow marriage friendship british unrequited love fear of commitment wedding thirty something group of friends best man rich man american girl gay couple commitment issues",False,tt0109831,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,254700832,1,0,41.45013866666667,-1.666470205521697,143803710.75,177125710.75,12215537.2,14378037.6,-597149.25,6439850.75,2430010.3333333335,6,8763343.666666666,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,17966644.0,9.0,20966644.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-3137195.0,2.0,1862805.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-567040.5,8576959.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10530930.888888888,5753153.111111111,2.125,1.6666666666666667,95723774.27597362

Via television, MI6 and the British military identify several wanted men, including American ""techno-terrorist"" Henry Gupta, who is buying a GPS encoder made by the American military. Despite M's insistence to let 007 finish his reconnaissance, British Admiral Roebuck launches a missile attack on the arms bazaar. Bond then discovers two Soviet nuclear torpedoes mounted on an L-39 Albatros, and as the missile is too far along to be aborted, 007 hijacks the L-39 and flies away before the weapons bazaar is struck. Gupta escapes with the encoder. Media baron Elliot Carver, head of the Carver Media Group Network , begins his plans to use the encoder to provoke war between China and the United Kingdom, which would replace the Chinese government with one more supportive to Carver's plans of exclusive broadcast rights. Meaconing the GPS signal using the encoder, Gupta sends the British frigate HMS Devonshire off-course into Chinese-held waters in the South China Sea, where Carver's stealth ship, commanded by Mr. Stamper, sinks the frigate with a sea drill and steals one of its missiles. Afterwards, Stamper's men shoot down a Chinese J-7 fighter jet sent to investigate the British presence, and kill the Devonshires survivors with Chinese weaponry. After reading a CMGN report of the incident as a Chinese attack, Roebuck deploys the British Fleet to recover the frigate, and possibly retaliate, leaving M only forty-eight hours to investigate its sinking. M sends Bond to investigate Carver after Carver Media releases news with critical details hours before these have become known, and MI6 noticed a spurious signal from one of his CMGN communications satellites when the frigate was sunk. Bond travels to Hamburg and seduces Carver's wife, Paris, an ex-girlfriend, to get information that would help him enter Carver's newspaper headquarters. After Bond steals back the GPS encoder, Carver orders Paris and Bond killed. Paris is killed by Dr. Kaufman, but Bond kills Kaufman and escapes in his BMW 750i. Bond then goes to the South China Sea to investigate the wreck, discovering one of the missiles missing. He and Wai Lin, a Chinese spy on the same case, are captured by Stamper and taken to the CMGN tower in Saigon, but they escape and then collaborate on the investigation. They contact the Royal Navy and the People's Liberation Army Air Force to explain Carver's scheme. They find Carver's stealth ship in Ha Long Bay and board it to prevent him firing the stolen British cruise missile at Beijing. During the battle, Wai Lin is captured. Bond captures Gupta to use as his own hostage, but Carver kills Gupta, claiming he has ""outlived his contract"". Bond detonates an explosive, damaging the ship and making it visible to radar, and vulnerable to a subsequent Royal Navy attack. While Wai Lin disables the engines, Bond goes after the missile. He kills Carver with his own sea drill. As Bond attempts to destroy the warhead, Stamper appears and fights him. Bond traps Stamper in the missile firing mechanism and dives to save Wai Lin as the missile explodes, destroying the ship and killing Stamper. Bond and Wai Lin survive amidst the wreckage as HMS Bedford searches for them.london, england england spy china news broadcast intelligence television missile manipulation of the media secret intelligence service special car tv station media tycoon navy motorcycle secret service hamburg germany",False,tt0120347,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,333011068,1,0,2.0273733454545453,-0.16960090051826512,134846389.88235295,153178742.82352942,95092312.8,111670312.8,122554759.57142857,136565473.85714287,158147517.0,5,192147517.0,2.0,-5017228.5,12.0,8982771.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,222689965.5,10.0,271689965.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,91387020.0,117557020.0,8.0,,,,294194034.0,352194034.0,1.0,,,,,,,147892789.5,177322789.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-10100000.0,5900000.0,1.0,,,,129420267.25,164170267.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,134243812.66666666,153557701.55555555,157606751.33333334,125273418.0,3.375,2.0,107279251.96773516

Puyi attempts suicide, which only renders him unconscious. In a flashback, apparently triggered as a dream, Puyi relives his first entry, with his wet nurse at his side, into the Forbidden City. The next section of the film is a series of chronological flashbacks showing Puyi's early life: from his royal upbringing, to the tumultuous period of the early Chinese Republic, to his subsequent exile, his Japanese-supported puppet reign of Manchukuo, and then his capture by the Soviet army — all of which are intermixed with flash-forwards portraying his prison life. Under the “Communist re-education program” for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced collaboration with the Imperial Japanese invaders for war crimes during their occupation of China during the war. Finally, after a heated discussion with the camp commandant and upon watching a propaganda film detailing the wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, Puyi recants his previous stance and is set free and rehabilitated by the government in 1958. The concluding section of the film ends with a flash-forward to the mid-1960s during the Mao cult and the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. By now, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant proletarian existence. On his way home from work, he happens upon a Red Guard parade, complete with children playing pentatonic music on accordions en masse and dancers who dance the rejection of landlordism by the Communists. His prison camp commander, his only friend during his incarceration, is forced to wear a dunce cap and a sandwich board bearing punitive slogans, and is one of the political prisoners now punished as an anti-revolutionary in the parade. Puyi later visits the Forbidden City as an ordinary tourist. There he meets an assertive little boy wearing the red scarf of the Pioneer Movement. The young Communist orders Puyi to step away from the throne. However, Puyi proves to the boy that he is indeed the Son of Heaven, proceeding to approach the throne. There, Puyi discovers the 60 year old pet cricket he kept as a child and gives it to the child. Amazed by the gift, the boy turns to talk to Puyi, but the emperor has disappeared. The film ends with a tour guide leading a tour in front of the throne, where the guide sums up Puyi's life in a few, brief sentences, concluding that he died in 1967.buddhism suicide china suicide attempt war crimes becoming an adult isolation war on drugs opium experiment drug addiction world war ii revolution emperor arranged marriage manchuria dynasty reeducation camp biography war coup d'etat autobiography based on a true story teacher beijing, china dowager decadence communism 1920s 1940s 1950s 1910s 1930s japanese occupation of china",False,tt0093389,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,43984230,0,0,0.9123578260869564,2.4643612765605467,132530565.0,138530565.0,,,,,,0,,,17145911.5,25.0,42145911.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7399242.333333333,19399242.333333332,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42145911.5,17145911.5,3.125,2.0,65482750.456980206

His younger colleagues show him no respect, he has a rocky relationship with his stepfather, Phillip , a tense relationship with his housemate, Pete , because of Ed , Shaun's crude best friend who lives on their couch and deals marijuana, and his girlfriend, Liz , is dissatisfied with their social life, as it consists primarily of spending every evening at the Winchester, Shaun and Ed's favourite pub. They never do anything alone together – Shaun always brings Ed, and Liz brings her flatmates, David  and Dianne . After a miserable day at work, Shaun meets an old friend, Yvonne , who asks him what he and Liz are doing for their anniversary, which makes him realise he forgot to book a table at a restaurant, as he had promised to do. Faced with this, Liz breaks up with him. Shaun drowns his sorrows with Ed at the Winchester. The two return home late and spin electro records, only to have Pete confront them, who is suffering a headache after being mugged and bitten by ""some crackheads"". Pete berates Shaun and tells him to sort his life out. Shaun resolves to do so. The next morning, an uprising of zombies has overwhelmed the town, but Shaun is too busy dealing with his problems and too hungover to notice. He and Ed become aware of what is happening after watching reports on TV, as zombies attack their house. After fighting back with weapons from the shed, they decide they need to go somewhere safe. Shaun and Ed decide that the safest place they know is the Winchester, and they plan to collect Shaun's mother, Barbara , Phillip, Liz, and her flatmates. Shaun discovers that a naked Pete is still in the house and is now a zombie, and he and Ed escape in Pete's car. After collecting Barbara and Phillip, who is bitten in the process, they switch cars and drive in Phillip's Jaguar and head to Liz, Dianne and David's flat, and collect them. Before they make it to the Winchester, Phillip dies of his bite, after he manages to make peace with Shaun. Abandoning the car as Phillip turns into a zombie, they set off on foot, bumping into Yvonne and her own band of survivors. Discovering that the path is infested with zombies, they devise a plan to sneak by, but Ed and Shaun get into an argument and the zombies are alerted. David smashes the window while Shaun distracts the zombies. Everyone takes refuge inside the pub, and Shaun joins them after giving the zombies the slip. After several hours, the zombies return. Ed gives away their position and the zombies converge on the pub. Shaun discovers that the Winchester rifle above the bar is functional and they use it to fend off the zombies. Barbara reveals a bite wound she picked up along the way and dies, becomes a zombie, and is reluctantly shot by a heartbroken Shaun. David is dismembered and disembowelled by the zombies, as a frantic Dianne unbolts the door to rescue him, exposing Shaun, Liz and Ed to the zombies. Ed prepares a Molotov cocktail to fend them off, but Pete arrives and bites him. He manages to get over the bar and Shaun uses the cocktail to set fire to the bar. They escape into the cellar. Trapped, they contemplate suicide, then discover a service hatch. Shaun and Liz escape through the hatch as a mortally wounded Ed stays behind with the rifle. Back on the street, as Shaun and Liz prepare to fight the zombies once more, the British Army arrives and they are rescued. Yvonne, who has also survived, shows up and tells Shaun and Liz to follow her. They approach the safety of the trucks, reconciled. Six months after the outbreak, the uninfected have returned to daily life, while the remaining zombies, retaining their instincts, are used as cheap labour and entertainment. Liz and Shaun have moved in together in Shaun's house, and Shaun is keeping Ed, who is now a zombie, tethered in the shed and playing video games.london, england record collection pub surrey british satire slacker friends dark comedy survival zombie cult film survival horror british pub boyfriend girlfriend british horror zombie apocalypse",False,tt0365748,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,30332385,0,0,6.58309625,1.9257596443831189,,,70855652.11538461,108490267.5,18900000.0,25900000.0,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-1509862.0,17.0,15740138.0,2.0,139320111.5,1.0,170320111.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33512118.0,38178784.666666664,3.0,18900000.0,25900000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,93030124.75,68905124.75,2.25,2.0,84824632.31357588

The United Kingdom is ruled by a totalitarian government under the fascist Norsefire party. The party sets up concentration camps where political prisoners, homosexuals, and other unwanted populace in general are exterminated by Britain's new fascist regime. Evey Hammond, a young woman who works at the state-run British Television Network, is rescued from an attempted rape perpetrated by members of the secret police known as the ""Fingermen"" by a Guy Fawkes-masked vigilante known as ""V"". He leads her to a rooftop to watch his destruction of the Old Bailey. Norsefire tries to explain away the incident as a controlled demolition, claiming the building was no longer structurally sound, but V takes over the state television broadcast the same day, exposing the lie. He urges the people of Britain to rise up against the oppressive government and meet him in one year, on November 5, outside the Houses of Parliament, which he promises to destroy. Evey helps V to escape, but is knocked out in the process. V brings Evey to his lair, where she is told that she must stay in hiding until the November 5 in the following year for her own safety. Upon learning that V is killing government officials, she escapes to the home of her boss, comedian and talk show host Gordon Deitrich . In return for Evey's trust in him with her very safety, Deitrich reveals to her an inner sanctum in his home housing a collection of materials outlawed by the government such as subversive paintings, the Quran, and to her surprise – homoerotic photos by Robert Mapplethorpe. Deitrich explains that even though she believed she was meeting him for a date that night V saved her from the fingermen, his intentions toward her was actually a cover under which he hides his actual sexuality. Rather than be his true self in the police state they live in, he has to keep up the expected image of someone who dates young girls such as herself lest he be imprisoned like all the other undesirables. One night, Gordon satirises the government on his television show. The secret police raid Deitrich's home, capturing him and Evey. She is incarcerated and tortured for days for information about V. She finds solace in notes written by another prisoner, an actress named Valerie Page , who was arrested for being a lesbian. Finally, Evey is told that she will be executed immediately unless she reveals V's location. An exhausted but defiant Evey says she would rather die, and is released. Evey discovers that she has been in V's lair all along, and that her imprisonment was staged to free her from her fears. She finds out Deitrich was executed for having a copy of the Quran. The notes were real, but they were passed by Valerie to V years earlier when he was similarly imprisoned. Although Evey initially hates V for what he did to her, she realizes she now feels stronger and free in spirit. She leaves him with a promise to return before November 5. Inspector Finch, Scotland Yard's chief of police, learns how Norsefire came to power and about V's origins in the course of his investigation. Fourteen years earlier, the United States had collapsed, due to being the victim of an unleashed bio-weapon, which was secretly and deliberately utilized by the people who would become the core of the group Norsefire. It is also mentioned later on that the United States is suffering another civil war between the Midwestern states. Britain suffered in the resulting chaos. Norsefire led a reactionary purge to restore order, during which ""enemies of the state"" — anyone who did not meet the Party's standards of ""purity"" — frequently disappeared. The country was divided over the loss of freedom until a coordinated bio-terrorist attack upon a school, a water treatment plant and a tube station resulted in at least 80,000 deaths. The fear generated by the attack allowed Norsefire to win the next election, thereafter silencing all opposition and turning the United Kingdom into a totalitarian state under High Chancellor Adam Sutler . A cure for the virus used in the bio-terrorist attack was later unveiled by a pharmaceutical company with ties to Norsefire. Finch comes to realize that Sutler and his now security chief, Peter Creedy , engineered the catastrophe to seize power. The virus was developed through deadly experimentation on ""social deviants"" and political dissidents at a detention centre in Larkhill where V had been detained with Valerie Page. Unlike the rest of the doomed prisoners, V gained heightened abilities and managed to escape when the centre was destroyed. Finch realizes that a string of murders involving high profile Norsefire party members are actually V taking revenge on those involved with Larkhill. As November 5 nears, V's various schemes cause chaos in the UK and the population starts questioning Norsefire's rule. V organizes the distribution of thousands of Guy Fawkes masks. On the eve of the 5th, Evey visits V, who shows her a train in the abandoned London Underground which he has filled with explosives to destroy Parliament. He leaves it up to Evey whether to use it, believing that he is unfit to decide. V then leaves to meet Creedy, who had made a deal with V to hand over Sutler in exchange for V's surrender. Although Creedy executes Sutler as V watches, V still refuses to surrender and is shot multiple times by Creedy's bodyguards. V survives due in part to his concealed armour breastplate, and kills Creedy and his men. Mortally wounded, V returns to Evey to thank her and admits he is in love with her. V dies in her arms afterwards. As Evey places the dead V in the train, she is found by Finch. Having learned much about the corruption of the Norsefire regime, Finch allows Evey to send the train on its way. Thousands of Londoners, all wearing the Guy Fawkes masks, and unarmed, march on Parliament to watch the event. Because Sutler and Creedy are dead and unable to give orders, the military stands down in the face of a civil rebellion. Accompanied by the ""1812 Overture"", Parliament and Big Ben are destroyed as Evey and Finch look on. Finch asks Evey for the identity of V, to which she replies, ""He was all of us.""detective dc comics fascism fascist dystopia government chancellor revenge torture hatred masked vigilante vengeful spirit activist vengeful",False,tt0434409,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,132511035,1,0,1.4539080555555557,-3.847336948521819,50618146.5,134368146.5,,,,,94013509.0,3,173013509.0,1.0,,0.0,,,305411.0,14.0,27246518.6,5.0,39766486.333333336,5.0,64366486.333333336,3.0,19098118.222222224,40.0,36087007.11111111,9.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,17966644.0,21.0,20966644.0,1.0,-2389127.0,27610873.0,1.0,55232107.0,113232107.0,2.0,27167075.5,42167075.5,2.0,,,,185845913.6,248245913.6,5.0,133440986.5,157190986.5,4.0,,,,21457178.833333332,83290512.16666667,6.0,109430290.57142857,190144576.2857143,7.0,,,,,,,,,,76097970.33333333,105264637.0,3.0,31045946.25,76545946.25,4.0,33388304.0,135888304.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-37821105.0,72178895.0,1.0,101183863.0,171183863.0,1.0,322409852.0,497409852.0,1.0,94164586.1111111,144886808.33333334,9.0,,,,12418031.913043479,46622379.73913044,23.0,,,64336033.00888889,34230033.71111111,10.375,3.8,92887866.92008553

Lord Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Wizarding and Muggle worlds and has chosen Draco Malfoy to carry out a secret mission. Severus Snape accepts Bellatrix Lestrange's challenge to make an Unbreakable Vow with Draco's mother, Narcissa, to protect Draco and fulfill the assignment if he fails. Harry accompanies Albus Dumbledore to visit former potions professor Horace Slughorn, who has gone into hiding. Slughorn agrees to return to teach at Hogwarts as Dumbledore tells Harry that Slughorn's return to Hogwarts is crucial. Leaving Fred and George's new shop, Harry, Ron and Hermione notice Draco and Narcissa associating with Death Eaters in Borgin and Burkes. Harry believes Voldemort has made Draco a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione are sceptical. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry spies on Draco, who hints to his friends that he does not plan to return to Hogwarts next year. Draco discovers Harry's presence and immobilises him, but Harry is rescued by Luna with her Spectrespecs. At Hogwarts, Harry and Ron are admitted to Slughorn's potions class at the last minute and have to borrow the needed textbooks because they don't have their own. Harry's copy is inscribed on the fly page as the ""Half-Blood Prince."" This owner, Harry finds, had annotated the book with additional instructions — tips and recommendations that allow Harry to excel in the class. As for Ron, he becomes the Keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and, thinking he has been given a Good Luck potion by Harry, Ron becomes a sports hero and partially as a result, he forms a romantic relationship with Lavender Brown, leaving Hermione disconsolate. Harry discovers Hermione sobbing in the Astronomy Tower, where he reveals to her that he has feelings for Ron's sister, Ginny Weasley. Harry spends Christmas with the Weasleys and becomes closer to Ginny. They almost share a kiss on Christmas Eve but Bellatrix and Fenrir Greyback, intent on capturing Harry, attack and burn the Burrow, home of the Weasleys. Outnumbered, Bellatrix and Greyback abandon their attack as Order members Nymphadora Tonks and Remus Lupin, together with Harry and the Weasleys, watch the structure burn. After being cured of a love potion meant for Harry, Ron is nearly killed by a drink originally intended for Dumbledore. While recovering, Ron murmurs Hermione's name in the hospital, in front of both Hermione and Lavender. Suspecting that Draco was responsible for two attempts on Dumbledore's life, one of which has almost killed Ron, Harry confronts Draco and severely injures him with a Sectumsempra curse taken from the textbook of the Half-Blood Prince. Harry, shocked that the curse has slliced open Draco's chest, retreats as Severus Snape enters and magically heals Draco's wound. Fearing the book may be filled with more Dark Magic, Ginny and Harry hide it in the Room of Requirement and, while doing so, share their first kiss. Dumbledore shows Harry memories of a young Tom Riddle and reveals that Slughorn retains a memory critical to Voldemort's defeat. Harry retrieves the memory, learning that Voldemort wanted information for creating seven Horcruxes. The Horcrux safeguards a portion of the creator's soul, granting him immortality unless the Horcrux is destroyed. Two of Voldemort's Horcruxes have already been destroyed: Tom Riddle's diary and Marvolo Gaunt's ring. Touching the ring, Harry has a vision of Voldemort, which is noticed by Dumbledore. After discovering the possible location of another Horcrux, Dumbledore requests Harry's help to retrieve it. They travel to a far-away cave where Harry is forced to make Dumbledore drink a mind-altering potion that hides the Horcrux, a locket. A weakened Dumbledore defends them from a horde of Inferi and apparates himself and Harry back to the Astronomy Tower at Hogwarts. In the meantime, Bellatrix, Greyback and several other Death Eaters enter the castle with Draco's help. Upon arriving at the tower, Dumbledore tells Harry to fetch Snape but as footsteps approach, he orders Harry to hide. Draco reveals that he has been chosen by Voldemort to kill Dumbledore, but he is unable to follow through. Snape arrives and casts the Avada Kedavra curse, killing Dumbledore. As Bellatrix casts the Dark Mark, Snape, Draco and the Death Eaters escape from the castle. Bellatrix destroys the Great Hall and sets fire to Hagrid's hut as Harry attempts to stop them. Snape overpowers Harry and reveals that he is the Half-Blood Prince before escaping. Harry returns to the school to find the staff and students mourning Dumbledore. Led by Minerva McGonagall, the students and teachers destroy the Dark Mark to honour Dumbledore whereupon Harry is comforted by Ginny. Harry later reveals to Ron and Hermione that the locket Horcrux was a fake. The locket contains a message from an ""R.A.B."" to Voldemort stating that he has stolen the real Horcrux with the intent of destroying it. His dying wish is that when Voldemort meets his match he will be mortal once more.

When their friend Ann Crook is kidnapped, they are drawn into a conspiracy with links higher up than they could possibly imagine. The kidnapping is soon followed by the gruesome murder of another woman, Martha Tabram , and it becomes apparent that they are being hunted down, one by one as various prostitutes are murdered and mutilated post mortem. The murder of Martha and her companions grabs the attention of Whitechapel Police Inspector Frederick Abberline , a brilliant yet troubled man whose police work is often aided by his psychic ""visions."" Abberline's investigations reveal that the murders, while gruesome, imply that an educated person is responsible due to the precise and almost surgical method used. Ann is found a few days later in asylum having been lobotomized after officials and doctors supposedly found her to be insane. It is implied this was done to silence her. Abberline consults Sir William Gull , a physician to the Royal Family, drawing on his experience and knowledge of medicine. These findings, coupled with his superiors impeding his investigations, point to a darker and organized conspiracy. Abberline becomes deeply involved with the case, which takes on personal meaning to him when he and Mary begin to fall in love. Abberline deduces that Masonic influence is definitely present in these crimes. His superior, a high ranking Freemason himself, then makes direct intervention and suspends Abberline. It is then revealed that Gull is the killer. He has been killing the witnesses to painter Albert Sickert 's forbidden Catholic marriage to Crook , who bore his legitimate daughter Alice. Sickert is actually Prince Edward, grandson of reigning Queen Victoria , and therefore Alice is heir to the British throne. Gull himself is a Freemason and his increasingly sinister behavior lends an insight into his murderous, but calculated mind. Rather than publicly charge Gull, the Freemasons decide to lobotomize Gull to protect the Royal family from the scandal. Gull defiantly states he has no equal among men, remaining unrepentant up to his lobotomy, resulting in him becoming invalid just as Ann had been. Mary Kelly doesn't die; Gull earlier mistook Ada, whom Liz said was from France , for Mary and he kills her instead. Mary lives with Alice in a cottage on a cliff by the sea. Abberline is found dead of an opium overdose, knowing he can never see Mary again without endangering her.london, england loss of loved one drug addiction jack the ripper united kingdom 20th century",True,tt0120681,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,74558115,0,0,1.1302318571428571,-0.8553948535632829,,,84765821.3,99337321.3,,,130015454.0,15,145515454.0,2.0,,0.0,,,28945680.0,25.0,42508180.0,8.0,260513217.0,6.0,357013217.0,2.0,-5067854.0,16.0,9932146.0,1.0,15301549.5,6.0,29976549.5,2.0,1684207.0,0.0,2684207.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,82392179.0,103592179.0,5.0,,,,,,,264692268.0,351692268.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,-7410692.0,589308.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-6439124.0,7060876.0,1.0,,,,128939335.0,148189335.0,2.0,,,,7090334.0,13878334.0,1.0,29357676.0,46357676.0,1.0,,,,,,97938292.25,71898708.91666667,8.5,2.6666666666666665,121757219.71668534

František Louka, a middle-aged Czech man dedicated to bachelorhood and the pursuit of women, is a concert cellist struggling to make out a living by playing funerals at the Prague crematorium. He has lost his previous job at the Czech Philharmonic due to having been half-accidentally blacklisted as ""politically unreliable"" by the authorities. A friend offers him a chance to earn a great deal of money through a sham marriage to a Russian woman to enable her to stay in Czechoslovakia. The woman then uses her Czechoslovak citizenship to emigrate and join her boyfriend in West Germany. Due to a concurrence of circumstances, she has to leave behind her Russian-speaking five-year-old son, Kolya, for the disgruntled Czech musician to look after. At first Louka and Kolya have communication difficulties, as they don't speak each other's languages and the many false friend words that exist in Czech and Russian add to the confusion. Gradually, though, a bond forms between Louka and Kolya. The child suffers from suspected meningitis and has to be placed on a course of carefully monitored antibiotics. Louka is threatened with imprisonment for his suspect marriage and the child may be placed in a Russian children's home. The Velvet Revolution intervenes though, and Kolya is reunited with his mother.

Assigned to Bravo Company, near the Cambodian border, he is worn down by the exhausting conditions and his enthusiasm for the war wanes. One night his unit is set upon by a group of North Vietnamese Army  soldiers, who retreat after a brief gunfight. New recruit Gardner is killed while another soldier, Tex, is maimed by friendly fire from a grenade thrown by Sergeant ""Red"" O'Neill , with Taylor being mistakenly reprimanded by the ruthless Staff Sergeant Bob Barnes . Taylor eventually gains acceptance from a tight-knit group in his unit who socialize and even use drugs in a cabin clubhouse. He finds a mentor in Sergeant Elias  as well as the elder King . During one patrol, a soldier named Manny is found mutilated and tied to a post while two others, Sal and Sandy, are killed by a booby-trap. As tension mounts, the platoon soon reaches a nearby village where a supply cache is discovered. Taylor finds a disabled young man and an elderly woman hiding in a spider hole. Taylor snaps, screaming and threatening the man but is shocked to see Bunny  then bludgeon him to death. Barnes interrogates the village chief to determine if they have been aiding the Vietcong. Despite the villagers' adamant denials, Barnes shoots and kills the chief's wife due to her persistent arguing. Barnes takes the child of the woman at gunpoint, threatening to shoot her if the villagers do not reveal information. Elias arrives, scolding Barnes and engaging in a scuffle with him over the incident. Platoon commander Lieutenant Wolfe  orders the men to leave with the villagers and burn the village. As they leave, Taylor stops a group of soldiers raping two girls. Upon returning to base, Captain Harris  warns that if he finds out an illegal killing took place, then a court-martial would be ordered, which concerns Barnes as Elias might give a testimony. On their next patrol, the platoon is ambushed and pinned down in a firefight, in which numerous soldiers are wounded. Wolfe calls in an artillery strike on incorrect coordinates, resulting in friendly fire casualties. Elias takes Taylor and Rhah  to intercept flanking enemy troops. Barnes orders the rest of the platoon to retreat, and goes back into the jungle to find Elias' group. Barnes finds Elias and shoots him, returning to tell the others that Elias was killed by the enemy. After they take off, a wounded Elias emerges from the jungle, running from a group of North Vietnamese soldiers. Taylor glances over at Barnes and reads the apprehension on his face as Elias dies. At the base, Taylor attempts to talk his group into retaliation when a drunken Barnes enters the room and taunts them. Taylor attacks him but is cut near his eye as a result. The platoon is sent back into the combat area to maintain defensive positions. King is sent home and Taylor shares a foxhole with Francis . That night, an NVA assault occurs and the defensive lines are broken. Several soldiers in the platoon including Junior, Bunny and Wolfe, are killed, while O'Neill barely escapes death by hiding under a dead soldier. To make matters worse, an NVA sapper armed with explosives rushes into battalion HQ, self-detonating and killing everyone inside. Meanwhile, Captain Harris orders his air support to expend all remaining ordnance inside his perimeter. During the chaos, Taylor encounters Barnes, but the wounded sergeant attacks him. Just before Barnes can pummel Taylor, both men are knocked unconscious by an explosion. Taylor regains consciousness the following morning, picks up an enemy Type 56, and finds an injured Barnes, who dares him to pull the trigger. Taylor shoots Barnes, killing him. Taylor then considers suicide with a grenade before reinforcements arrive and find him. Francis, who survived the battle unharmed, deliberately stabs himself in the leg and reminds Taylor that because they have been twice wounded, they can return home to the U.S. O'Neill, who desperately wants to go home, is told he will remain in duty and replace Barnes. The helicopter flies away and Taylor weeps as he stares down at the death and destruction.hero mine vietnam war village jungle soldier battle platoon combat",False,tt0091763,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,138530565,0,0,22.088427499999998,2.3644495162840293,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,10725000.0,14925000.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-3000000.0,1500000.0,1.0,,,,,,,71971200.0,78371200.0,1.0,,,,,,,-3000000.0,1500000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,32700000.0,35000000.0,1.0,,,,-3000000.0,1500000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,-3000000.0,1500000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,55214818.96773516

Robert is coerced by Father Spiletto ([[Martin Benson  into substituting for the dead child an orphan whose mother died at the same moment, without telling Katherine. Out of concern for his wife's mental well-being, Robert agrees. They name the child Damien Thorn . Soon after, Robert is named U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain. While posted in England, Robert is plagued by several mysterious events. Damien's nanny publicly hangs herself at his fifth birthday party and a new nanny, Mrs. Baylock , suddenly arrives to replace her, also bringing an evil Rottweiler dog with her. Father Brennan  is aware of Damien's satanic origins and he explains them to Robert, who refuses to believe him. Brennan also warns Robert that his wife is pregnant, that Damien intends to kill the unborn child and that eventually he will kill Robert, too. The priest subsequently dies when a lightning rod falls on him and impales him through the side of his neck. Katherine tells Robert that she is pregnant but miscarries when she is knocked off a balcony by Damien. Following Father Brennan's death, and while piecing together other clues, photographer Keith Jennings ([[David Warner  begins investigating Damien after noticing marks on photographs of people that seem to predict their subsequent deaths. Keith travels with Robert as they investigate Damien's birth. They visit the Rome hospital but find that a fire destroyed the hospital records and maternity and nursery wards. Robert and Keith visit Father Spiletto at a rural monastery and discover he has been burned on his right half and struck mute. They are sent to a ruined cemetery and find a jackal's skeleton in Damien's mother's grave, and discover that Robert and Katherine's child was murdered to place Damien in their care. These shocking discoveries force Robert and Keith to believe Father Brennan's warning that Damien is the Antichrist. While Robert is away, Katherine is recuperating in the hospital from her injuries. All seems to go fine, when Mrs. Baylock suddenly appears and pushes her through a window, sending her body crashing into a parked ambulance. Robert travels with Keith to Israel to find Bugenhagen, an archaeologist who knows how to stop the Antichrist. Bugenhagen reveals that Damien will possess a birthmark in the shape of three sixes if he is the Antichrist. Robert learns that the only way to kill Damien is to stab him with the seven daggers of Megiddo. Refusing to murder what he believes is an innocent child, Robert throws the pack of daggers away from them. When Keith bends to retrieve them, a sheet of glass slides off a runaway truck, flies into him, and decapitates him. Horrified by Keith's death and having recovered the daggers, Robert returns to England and finds the birthmark buried under the hair on Damien's scalp. Mrs. Baylock attempts to murder Robert, but is stabbed through the side of her neck with a carving fork. Robert flees his residence with Damien, to kill him on hallowed ground, and is pursued by a security detail. After breaking into a church, Robert raises a dagger to stab Damien but is shot and killed before he can do so. Damien is placed in the care of the U.S. President, who is Robert's brother. They attend the funeral of Katherine and Robert, who receive an honorable burial and blessing by a Catholic priest. The camera then pans down on Damien, who turns to the audience and smiles innocently while ""Ave Satani"" plays.monk prophecy ambassador nanny rottweiler devil's son revelation animal attack photography anti-christ priest decapitation paranormal phenomena cowardliness baboon archaeologist",False,tt0075005,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,60922980,0,0,20.75820714285714,8.682732696668719,,,58642439.666666664,71280773.0,,,22900000.0,15,28900000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,9100000.0,4.0,12600000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,122381062.0,12.0,124881062.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42370051.5,55870051.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,29251525.0,34251525.0,1.0,,,,,,,35416090.666666664,41016090.666666664,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9493313.333333334,11446646.666666666,3.0,,,,23762636.0,40220136.0,2.0,,,55460354.0,51460354.0,3.875,1.0,68228109.06047031

The shooter is Humbert Humbert , a 40-something British professor of French literature. Four years earlier, Humbert arrives in Ramsdale, New Hampshire, intending to spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio. He searches for a room to let, and Charlotte Haze , a blowsy, sexually frustrated widow, invites him to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her daughter, Dolores , affectionately called ""Lolita"". Lolita is a soda-pop drinking, gum-snapping, overtly flirtatious teenager, with whom Humbert falls in love. To be close to Lolita, Humbert accepts Charlotte's offer and becomes a lodger in the Haze household, but Charlotte wants all of ""Hum's"" time for herself and soon announces that she will be sending Lolita to an all-girl sleepaway camp for the summer. After the Hazes depart for camp, the maid gives Humbert a letter from Charlotte, confessing her love for him and demanding he vacate at once unless he feels the same way. The letter says that if Humbert is still in the house when she returns, Charlotte will know that her love is requited, and he must marry her. Though he roars with laughter while reading the sadly heartfelt yet characteristically overblown letter, Humbert marries Charlotte. Things turn sour for the couple in the absence of Lolita. Humbert becomes more withdrawn while Charlotte becomes more whiny. Charlotte then discovers Humbert’s diary entries detailing his passion for Lolita and characterizing her as ""the Haze woman, the cow, the obnoxious mama, the brainless baba"". She has an hysterical outburst and, while Humbert hurriedly fixes martinis in the kitchen to smooth over the situation, she runs outside, is hit by a car, and dies. Humbert drives to the camp to pick up Lolita, who doesn't yet know her mother is dead. They stay the night in a hotel that is handling an overflow influx of police officers attending a convention. One of the guests, Quilty, pretends to be a policeman and insinuates himself upon Humbert and keeps steering the conversation to his ""beautiful little daughter,"" who is asleep upstairs, while repeating, too often, that he thinks Humbert is ""normal."" Humbert escapes the Quilty's advances, and, the next morning, Humbert and Lolita enter into a sexual relationship. The two commence an odyssey across the United States, traveling from hotel to motel. In public, they act as father and daughter. After several days, Humbert tells Lolita that her mother is not sick in a hospital, as he had previously told her, but dead. Grief-stricken, she stays with Humbert. In the fall, Humbert reports to his position at Beardsley College, and enrolls Lolita in high school there. Before long, people begin to wonder about the relationship between father and his over-protected daughter. Humbert worries about her involvement with the school play and with male classmates. One night he returns home to find Dr. Zempf, a pushy, abrasive stranger, sitting in his darkened living room. Zempf, speaking with a thick German accent, claims to be from Lolita's school and wants to discuss her knowledge of ""the facts of life."" Humbert is frightened and decides to take Lolita on the road again. He soon realizes they are being followed by a mysterious car that never drops away but never quite catches up. When Lolita becomes sick, he takes her to the hospital. However, when he returns to pick her up, she is gone. The nurse  there tells him she left with another man claiming to be her uncle and Humbert, devastated, is left without a single clue as to her disappearance or whereabouts. Some years later, Humbert receives a letter from Mrs. Richard T. Schiller, Lolita's married name. She writes that she is now married to a man named Dick , and that she is pregnant and in desperate need of money. Humbert travels to their home and finds that she is now a roundly, expectant woman in glasses leading a pleasant, humdrum life. Humbert demands that she tell him who kidnapped her three years earlier. She tells him it was Clare Quilty, the man that was following them, who is a famous playwright and with whom her mother had a fling in Ramsdale days. She states Quilty is also the one who disguised himself as the policeman and Dr. Zempf as well as well as the anonymous phone caller from earlier. Lolita herself carried on an affair with him and left with him when he promised her glamor. However, he then demanded she join his depraved lifestyle, including acting in his ""art"" films. Humbert begs Lolita to leave her husband and come away with him, but she declines. Humbert gives Lolita 13,000, explaining that it is hers from the sale of her mother's house and leaves to shoot Quilty in his mansion, where the film began. The epilogue explains that Humbert died of coronary thrombosis awaiting trial for Quilty's murder.sexual obsession hotel loss of loved one depression small town flirt midlife crisis eroticism youngster lolita motel diary seduction forbidden love literature professor provocation fascination one-sided love widow adoptive father summer camp secret love",False,tt0056193,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,9250000,0,0,3.625,4.1232103568370615,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22900000.0,28900000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,64721690.498195834

As darkness falls, they decide to stop for the night at a pub called ""The Slaughtered Lamb"". Jack notices a five-pointed star on the wall. When he asks about it, the pub becomes very quiet and the pubgoers start acting very strange and hostile. The pair decide to leave, but not before the others offer them pieces of advice such as ""Beware the moon, lads"" and ""Keep to the road."" Whilst conversing with each other and wondering what they meant, they wander off the road, onto the moors. Back at the pub, the owner gets very distressed and suggests that they go after the pair. As she says this, a sinister howling is heard. The rest of the pubgoers, having barricaded the door, decline. Back out on the moors, Jack and David have also heard the howls, and they seem to be steadily getting closer. They start back to the Slaughtered Lamb when they realize that they have left the road and are now lost on the moors. A full moon comes out from behind the clouds, and they remember the advice they were given earlier. The noises get steadily closer until they are stopped by a supernaturally large animal. The animal attacks both of them, and kills Jack. The animal is then shot and killed by the pubgoers, who have finally emerged. The beast changes into the dying body of a naked man. David survives the mauling and is taken to a hospital in London. When David wakes up three weeks later, he does not remember what happened and is told of his friend's death. David is questioned by the arrogant Inspector Villiers and the bumbling, but more understanding Sergeant McManus and learns that he and Jack were supposedly attacked by an escaped lunatic. David insists that they were actually attacked by a large wolf. But Villiers had already been told there were witnesses and an autopsy report of the maniac, so they deduce that David is suffering from shock. David begins to have a series of bizarre nightmares. In the first, he runs through the woods, then decapitates and eats a deer. In the second, he is in a hospital bed with a monstrous, fanged face. In the final dream, he is at home with his family when they are attacked by Nazis with monstrous faces. Things get stranger when Jack, now a reanimated corpse, comes to visit David and explains that they were attacked by a werewolf, stating that David himself is, in fact, now a werewolf. Jack urges David to kill himself before the next full moon, not only because Jack is cursed to exist in a state of living death for as long as the bloodline of the werewolf that attacked them survives, but also to prevent David from inflicting the same fate on his eventual victims. Trying to see if David is indeed telling the truth, his doctor, Hirsch takes a trip to the Slaughtered Lamb. However, when asked about the incident, the pubgoers deny any knowledge of David, Jack or their attacker. But one distraught pubgoer speaks to Dr. Hirsch outside the pub and says that David should not have been taken away, and that he and everyone else will be in danger when he changes. He's interrupted by another pubgoer, who remains silent. After more investigation, Dr. Hirsch finds out that the police report was ""misplaced"", and that David's wounds were cleaned and dressed before he was even looked at by the authorities. The doctor is convinced that the whole town was lying, and that David was indeed attacked by some sort of animal, though he is not convinced it was a werewolf. Upon his release from the hospital, David moves in with Alex Price, the pretty young nurse who grew infatuated with him in the hospital. He stays in Alex's London apartment, where they later make love for the first time. Jack  suddenly appears to David again and tells him that he will turn into a werewolf the next day. Jack advises David to take his own life; otherwise he is doomed to kill innocent people who will then become the living dead. When the full moon rises, as Jack had warned, David, who is alone in the apartment, begins to feel excruciating pain before stripping naked upon ""burning up"" and turning into a werewolf. He prowls the streets and the London Underground and slaughters six Londoners. When he wakes in the morning, he is naked on the floor of the wolf cage at London Zoo with no memory of his nocturnal, lupine, lycanthropic, carnivorous activities, but unharmed by the resident wolves. Later that day, David realizes that Jack was right about everything and that he is responsible for the murders of the night before. After failing to get himself arrested and running from Alex, David calls his family in New York to basically say good-bye, though he only speaks to his little sister. Walking out of the phone booth after failing to slit his wrists with his pocket knife, David spots Jack  outside an adult cinema in Piccadilly Circus. Inside, Jack is accompanied by David's victims from the previous night. They all insist that he must commit suicide before turning into a werewolf again. While talking with them, night falls and, consequently, David turns into a werewolf again and goes on another killing spree. After busting out of the cinema , a horrific melee ensues. David is ultimately cornered in an alley by the police. Alex arrives to calm him down by telling him that she loves him. Though he is apparently temporarily softened, he is shot and killed when he lunges forward, returning to human form in front of a grieving Alex as he dies.london, england nurse loss of loved one intensive care zoo dying and death transformation full moon black humor pub london underground yorkshire rural area werewolf cult film british pub dream sequence hikers moors animal horror",False,tt0082010,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,31973249,0,0,2.1973249,4.391301574055172,12866246.25,18991246.25,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-3889987.0,14110013.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,59926399.23225083

They are paraded before the camp commandant, Colonel Saito , who informs them of his rules; all prisoners, regardless of rank, are to work on the construction of a bridge over the River Kwai to carry a new railway line to invade Burma. Their commander, Lt. Colonel Nicholson , reminds Saito that the Geneva Conventions exempt officers from manual labour. At the following morning’s parade, Nicholson orders his officers to remain behind when the enlisted men head off to work. Saito slaps him hard across the face with his copy of the conventions and threatens to have them shot, but Nicholson refuses to back down. When Major Clipton , the British medical officer, intervenes, Saito leaves the officers standing all day in the intense tropical heat. That evening, the officers are placed in a punishment hut, while Nicholson is locked in ‘the oven’, an iron box, without food or water. Clipton attempts to secure Nicholson's release, but Nicholson refuses to compromise. Meanwhile, the prisoners are working as little as possible and sabotaging whatever they can. Saito is concerned because, should he fail to meet his deadline, he would be obliged to commit seppuku . Using the anniversary of Japan's great victory in the 1905 Russo-Japanese War as an excuse to save face, he gives in, and Nicholson and his officers are released. Nicholson conducts an inspection and is shocked by what he finds. Against the protests of some of his officers, he orders Captain Reeves  and Major Hughes ([[John Boxer  to design and build a proper bridge, despite its military value to the Japanese, for the sake of his men's morale. The Japanese engineers had chosen a poor site, so the original construction is abandoned and a new bridge is begun 400 yards downstream. Meanwhile, three prisoners attempt to escape. Two are shot dead, but United States Navy Commander Shears , gets away, although badly wounded. After many days, Shears eventually stumbles into a village, whose people help him to escape by a boat. Shears is enjoying his recovery at the Mount Lavinia Hospital at Ceylon , when Major Warden  asks him to volunteer for a commando mission to destroy the bridge. Shears is horrified at the idea and reveals that he is not an officer at all. He was an enlisted man on the cruiser USS Houston. He switched uniforms with the dead Commander Shears after the sinking of their ship to get better treatment. Warden already knows this and has had ""Shears"" reassigned to British duty. Faced with the prospect of being charged with impersonating an officer, Shears has no choice but to volunteer; Warden gives him the ""simulated rank of major"". Meanwhile, Nicholson drives his men, even volunteering to have them work harder to complete the bridge on time. For Nicholson, its completion will exemplify the ingenuity and hard work of the British Army for generations. When he asks that their Japanese counterparts join in as well, a resigned Saito replies that he has already given the order. The commandos parachute in, although one is killed in a bad landing. The other three—Warden, Shears, and Canadian Lieutenant Joyce —reach the river with the assistance of Siamese women porters and their village chief, Khun Yai. Warden is wounded in an encounter with a Japanese patrol, and has to be carried on a litter. The trio reach the bridge in time and plant explosives underwater under cover of darkness. A train carrying soldiers and important dignitaries is scheduled to be the first to use the bridge the following afternoon, so Warden plans to destroy both at the same time. However, by dawn the water level has dropped, exposing the wire connecting the explosives to the detonator. Making a final inspection, Nicholson spots the wire and brings it to Saito's attention to the consternation of the commando team. As the train is heard approaching, Nicholson, with Saito in tow, hurries down to the riverbank to investigate. Joyce, hiding with the detonator, breaks cover and stabs Saito to death; Nicholson yells for help, while attempting to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator. Shears and Warden yell for Joyce to kill Nicholson, but Joyce is shot by Japanese fire. Shears then swims across the river to fulfill the mission, but is shot just before he reaches Nicholson. Recognising the dying Shears, Nicholson exclaims: ""What have I done?"" Warden fires his mortar, mortally wounding Nicholson. The dazed colonel stumbles towards the detonator and falls on it as he dies, just in time to blow up the bridge and send the train hurtling into the river below. As he witnesses the carnage, Clipton shakes his head uttering: ""Madness!...

An expedition led by a young man called Valerian  seeks the last sorcerer, Ulrich of Craggenmoor , for help. A brutish centurion from Urland named Tyrian , who has followed the expedition, intimidates the wizard. Ulrich invites Tyrian to stab him to prove his magical powers. Tyrian does so and Ulrich dies instantly, to the horror of his young apprentice Galen Bradwarden  and his elderly servant Hodge . They cremate Ulrich's body and place the ashes in a leather pouch. Galen inherits the wizard's magical amulet, and takes it upon himself to journey to Urland. On the way, he accidentally discovers Valerian is really a young woman, who disguised herself to avoid being selected in the lottery. In an effort to discourage the expedition, Tyrian kills Hodge; before dying, he hands Galen the pouch and dies with the words ""Burning water..."" on his lips. Arriving in Urland, Galen inspects the dragon's lair and attempts to seal its entrance by causing rocks to fall from the cliff. Tyrian apprehends Galen and takes him to the court of King Casiodorus. After noticing Galen's constant grasping of the amulet during his clumsy attempts at magic tricks, King Casiodorus guesses that he is not a real wizard and complains that his attack may have angered the dragon instead of killing it, as his own brother and predecessor once did. The king then confiscates the amulet and imprisons Galen. His daughter Elspeth  comes to taunt Galen, but is shocked when he informs her of rumours the lottery is rigged. Casiodorus is unable to lie convincingly when she confronts him. Meanwhile, the dragon frees itself from its prison and causes an earthquake. Galen narrowly escapes, but without the amulet. The village priest, Brother Jacopus , leads his congregation to confront the dragon, denouncing it as the Devil, but the dragon incinerates him and then heads for the village, burning all in its path. When the lottery begins anew, Princess Elspeth rigs the draw so that only her name can be chosen, in reparation. The King returns the amulet to Galen so that he might save Elspeth. Galen uses the amulet to enchant a heavy spear  forged strong enough to pierce the dragon's armored hide. Meanwhile, Valerian gathers some molted dragon scales and uses them to make Galen a shield, and the two realize they have romantic feelings for one another. She discovers that Vermithrax has a brood of dragonets. As Galen attempts to rescue Princess Elspeth, he fights and kills Tyrian. The Princess, however, has descended into the dragon's cave to her death. Galen follows her and finds the young dragons feasting upon her corpse. He kills them and then finds Vermithrax nesting by an underground lake of fire. He manages to wound the monster but the spear is broken and only Valerian's shield saves him from incineration. After his failure to kill Vermithrax, Valerian convinces Galen to leave the village with her. As the two lovers prepare to leave, the amulet gives Galen a vision that explains his teacher's final wishes. Ulrich had asked that his ashes be spread over ""burning water"", and Galen realizes that the wizard had planned his own death and cremation after realizing he was not in the condition to make the journey by himself, and used Galen to deliver him to Urland to fight the dragon. Galen then returns to the cave, spreading the ashes and the wizard is resurrected from the flames of the burning lake. Ulrich reveals that his time is short and that Galen must destroy the amulet when the time is right. The wizard then transports himself to a mountaintop and attracts the dragon's attention. After a brief battle, the monster grabs the old man and flies away with him. Galen crushes the amulet with a rock, causing the wizard to explode and killing the dragon. Inspecting the wreckage, the villagers credit God with the victory, while the king arrives and drives a sword into the dragon's broken carcass to claim the glory for himself. As Galen and Valerian leave Urland together, he confesses that he misses both Ulrich and the amulet, and they both realize that the age of wizards and dragons may be finished. But when he says, out loud, ""I just wish we had a horse"", as if on cue, a white horse appears to take the incredulous lovers away.secret identity self sacrifice magic virgin solar eclipse sacrifice sorcerer's apprentice amulet lottery brood princess sorcerer human sacrifice dragon hidden identity crossdressing landslide sword and sorcery",False,tt0082288,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,14110013,0,0,-0.2756898239569304,4.391301574055172,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,51786065.5,16.0,57786065.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,39885000.0,71000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9000000.0,20000000.0,1.0,57148552.666666664,70315219.33333333,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,93931801.0,104931801.0,1.0,,,,93931801.0,104931801.0,1.0,,,,12500000.0,16000000.0,1.0,,,57786065.5,51786065.5,2.0,2.0,59926399.23225083

Prince Colwyn and Princess Lyssa attempt to marry and form an alliance between their rival kingdoms in the hope that their combined forces can defeat the Beast's army. A prophecy foretells that Lyssa will bear a child destined to rule the galaxy. The Beast has his Slayers attack the wedding before it is concluded. The castle of Lyssa's father, King Eirig, is destroyed and the Kings are murdered. The Kingdoms' armies are devastated and the princess is kidnapped. Colwyn, the only survivor, is found and nursed by Ynyr the Old One. Colwyn sets out to rescue Lyssa, but he must first find ""the Glaive"", an ancient, magical star-shaped weapon, which he retrieves from a high mountain cave. Next, he must track down the Black Fortress, which teleports to a new location every day at sunrise. He is joined by an accident-prone magician, Ergo ""the Magnificent"", the cyclops Rell , and Torquil, the leader of a band of ten fugitives that includes Kegan, Rhun, and Oswyn. Colwyn enlists the convicts' aid and in return offers them their freedom as their reward. Colwyn and Ynyr get help from the blind prophet the Emerald Seer, and his young apprentice Titch, to find the Black Fortress. However, the Beast has the seer killed before he can reveal its location. With time running short, Ynyr journeys to the Widow of the Web for aid. The Widow is actually an enchantress, also named Lyssa, who loved Ynyr long ago and was exiled to the lair of the Crystal Spider, for murdering their only child. The Widow reveals where the Beast's fortress will be at the next sunrise. She also gives Ynyr the sand from the enchanted hourglass that kept the Crystal Spider from attacking her. Ynyr quickly flees the web as the Crystal Spider attacks the Widow's prison and begins to destroy it. Ynyr returns to the group to reveal the news before he loses the last of the sand, which kills him. Colwyn and his followers use captured Fire Mares  to reach the Black Fortress, but are attacked by Slayers, who kill Rhun. When they get to the Black Fortress, Rell uses his massive strength to hold open the huge doors long enough for the others to enter. He dies when the entrance closes, crushing him. Kegan is killed by a Slayer shortly afterwards and Colwyn gets lost in the labyrinthine interior. When the Slayers try to kill Titch, Ergo magically transforms into a tiger and kills the Slayers, injuring himself while saving Titch's life. Torquil and Oswyn are caught in a trap with slowly closing walls studded with massive spikes. Colwyn injures the Beast with the Glaive and finds Lyssa. He is unable to recover the Glaive from the Beast's body. Lyssa realizes that together, their ability to project flame can finish the beast. The two use the flame to slay the Beast and they make their way out of the crumbling fortress, finding Torquil and Oswyn and retrieving Ergo and Titch. The survivors watch as the Black Fortress crumbles and is sucked up into the sky. Colwyn names Torquil as Lord Marshal, which Torquil accepts. As the heroes depart across a field, the narrator confirms that they will rule the world and their child shall rule the galaxy.kingdom lightsaber cult favorite dead body magical object fortress cult film doppelgänger cyclops changeling",False,tt0085811,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,16519460,0,0,-0.634435992459802,6.872979369498223,,,19469532.666666668,24269532.666666668,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41240847.5,56740847.5,2.0,41888917.75,56263917.75,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,111692319.0,112892319.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,70929371.26798174

Sent on a suicidal charge against the invading Germans, he uses impressive marksmanship skills—taught to him by his grandfather from a young age—to save himself and commissar Danilov . Nikita Khrushchev  arrives in Stalingrad to coordinate the city's defenses and demands ideas to improve morale. Danilov, now a Senior Lieutenant, suggests that the people need figures to idolize, and publishes tales of Vassili's exploits in the army's newspaper that paint him as a national hero and propaganda icon. Vassili is transferred to the sniper division, and he and Danilov become friends. They also both become romantically interested in Tania , a citizen of Stalingrad who has become a Private in the local militia. Danilov has her transferred to an intelligence unit away from the battlefield. With the Soviet snipers taking an increasing toll on the German forces, German Major Erwin König  is deployed to Stalingrad to take out Vassili and thus crush Soviet morale. A renowned marksman and head of the German Army sniper school at Zossen, he lures Vassili into a trap and takes out two of his fellow snipers, but Vassili manages to escape. When the Red Army command learns of König's mission, they dispatch his former student Koulikov  to help Vassili kill him. However, König tricks Koulikov into revealing his position and kills him with a very skillful shot, shaking Vassili's spirits considerably. Khrushchev pressures Danilov to bring the sniper standoff to a conclusion. When Tania requests to be reassigned to the sniper division, Danilov asks Vassili to discourage her. Vassili attempts to do so, but relents when Tania tells him how her Jewish parents were murdered by the Germans. Danilov recruits young local boy Sacha Fillipov , who idolizes Vassili and does small jobs for the Germans in exchange for food, to act as a double agent by passing König false information about Vassili's whereabouts, thus giving Vassili a chance to ambush the Major. Vassili sets a trap for König and manages to wound him, but during a second attempt Vassili falls asleep after many hours and his sniper log is taken by a looting German soldier. The German command takes the log as evidence of Vassili's death and plans to send König home, but the Major does not believe that Vassili is dead. He tells Sacha where he will be next, suspecting that the boy will tell Vassili. Tania and Vassili have meanwhile fallen in love, and the jealous Danilov disparages Vassili in a letter to his superiors. König spots Tania and Vassili waiting for him at his next ambush, confirming his suspicions about Sacha. He kills the boy and hangs his body from a pole to bait Vassili. Vassili vows to kill König and sends Tania and Danilov to evacuate Sacha's mother  from the city, but Tania is wounded by shrapnel en route to the evacuation boats. Thinking her dead, Danilov laments his jealousy for Vassili and his resulting disenchantment with the communist cause. Finding Vassili waiting to ambush König, Danilov intentionally exposes himself in order to reveal the Major's position and is killed. Thinking he has killed Vassili, König goes to inspect the body, but realizes too late that he has fallen into a trap and is in Vassili's sights. He turns to face Vassili, who then kills him. Two months later, after Stalingrad has been liberated and the German forces have surrendered, Vassili finds Tania recovering in a field hospital.winter sniper world war ii russia stalingrad 1940s",True,tt0215750,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,96976270,0,0,0.4261216176470588,-0.8553948535632829,,,-5440769.5,24684230.5,,,-12143288.0,2,2856712.0,1.0,-7853917.0,3.0,146083.0,1.0,,0.0,,,264317794.0,3.0,289317794.0,1.0,-7901045.4,19.0,11298954.6,5.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,77167957.5,99917957.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-17447968.0,16052032.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,204245898.33333334,269912565.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,226832400.0,361832400.0,1.0,,,,15692101.0,70692101.0,1.0,,,,52000000.0,58000000.0,1.0,,,75904885.9,59104885.9,3.375,2.0,121757219.71668534

With the bulk of the peacekeepers withdrawn, the Somali militia have declared war on the remaining UN personnel. In response, U.S. Army Rangers, Delta Force personnel, and 160th SOAR aviators are deployed to Somalia to capture Mohammed Farrah Aidid, self-proclaimed president of the country. Outside Mogadishu, Rangers and Delta Force operators capture Osman Ali Atto, a warlord selling arms to the militia of Aidid. Shortly thereafter, a mission is planned to capture Omar Salad Elmi and Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdiid, two of Aidid's top advisers. The U.S. forces include experienced men as well as new recruits, including Private First Class Todd Blackburn and a desk clerk going on his first mission. When his Lieutenant is removed from duty as the result of a seizure, Staff Sergeant Matthew Eversmann is placed in command of Ranger Chalk Four, his first command. The operation is launched and Delta Force operators successfully capture Aidid's advisers inside the target building, but the Rangers and helicopters escorting the ground-extraction convoy take heavy fire, while Sgt. Eversmann's Chalk Four is dropped a block away by mistake. When Blackburn is severely injured after falling from one of the Black Hawk helicopters, three Humvees led by Sergeant  Jeff Struecker are detached from the convoy to return Blackburn to the UN-held Mogadishu Airport. Sgt. Dominick Pilla is shot and killed just as Struecker's column gets underway, and shortly thereafter Black Hawk Super-Six One, piloted by CWO Clifton ""Elvis"" Wolcott, is shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade  and crashes deep within the city. Both pilots are killed, the two crew chiefs are wounded, and one Delta sniper on board escapes in another helo that makes it back to base. The ground forces are rerouted to converge on the crash site, but the Somali militia throw up roadblocks, causing LTC Danny McKnight's Humvee column to lose its way, while sustaining heavy casualties. Meanwhile, two Ranger Chalks, including Eversmann's unit, reach Super-Six One's crash site, setting up a defensive perimeter to await evacuation with the two wounded men and the fallen pilots. In the interim, Super-Six Four, piloted by CWO Michael Durant is also shot down by an RPG, crashing several blocks away. With Cpt. Mike Steele's Rangers pinned down and sustaining heavy casualties, no ground forces can reach Super Six Four's crash site, nor reinforce the Rangers defending Super Six One. Two Delta snipers, SFC Randy Shughart and MSG Gary Gordon are inserted by helicopter to Super Six Four's crash site, where they find Durant still alive. The crash site is eventually overrun, Gordon and Shughart are killed, and Durant is captured and taken to Aidid. McKnight's column gives up the attempt to reach Six-One's crash site, and returns to base with their prisoners and the casualties. The men prepare to go back to extract the pinned down Rangers and the fallen pilots and MG Garrison orders the 10th Mountain Division, including Malaysian and Pakistani forces, to mobilize as a relief column. As night falls the Somali militia launch a sustained assault on the trapped Americans at Super Six One's crash site. The militia is held off throughout the night by strafing runs and rocket attacks from AH-6J Little Bird helicopter gunships of the Nightstalkers, until the 10th Mountain Division's relief column is able to reach the site. The wounded and casualties are evacuated in the vehicles, but a handful of remaining Rangers and Delta Force operators are forced to run from the crash site back to the stadium, in the UN Safe Zone. The closing credits detail the results of the raid: 19 American soldiers were killed, with over 1,000 Somalis dead. Durant was released after 11 days of captivity. Delta snipers Gordon and Shughart were the first soldiers to be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War. On August 2, 1996, Aidid was killed in a battle with a rival clan. General Garrison retired the following day.prisoner of war wound somalia warlord famine delta force rescue operation",False,tt0265086,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,172989651,0,0,0.8803222934782609,-0.8553948535632829,,,,,309666347.5,404666347.5,,0,,,7863985.666666667,5.0,14197319.0,3.0,-22749471.0,4.0,18750529.0,2.0,-26043392.0,4.0,33956608.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,12491080.0,5.0,16491080.0,1.0,,0.0,,,264692268.0,351692268.0,1.0,309666347.5,404666347.5,2.0,,,,208067212.66666666,280733879.3333333,3.0,,,,134780605.5,192280605.5,2.0,111554491.66666667,161637825.0,6.0,-6439124.0,7060876.0,1.0,-5281329.0,3468671.0,2.0,,,,-6000000.0,1000000.0,1.0,,,,196396944.66666666,271396944.6666667,3.0,,,,,,,,,,309666347.5,404666347.5,2.0,,,,-11100000.0,16900000.0,1.0,354640427.0,457640427.0,1.0,165627346.5,229627346.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20848884.0,-7109449.333333333,2.25,1.75,121757219.71668534

She decides to exact revenge on a recent lover by having his young new fiancee, Cécile de Volanges , the daughter of Merteuil's cousin Madame de Volanges , seduced and ruined. Merteuil calls on her sometime-partner, the rakish and similarly amoral Vicomte de Valmont , to do the deed. At first, Valmont refuses her proposition; he is busy trying to seduce the virtuous Madame de Tourvel , who is spending time at his aunt's manor house while her husband is abroad. Upon discovering that the uptight and superficial Madame de Volanges had been secretly writing to Madame de Tourvel to warn her against his evil nature, Valmont changes his mind and decides to follow Merteuil's scheme. They take advantage of the fact that young Cécile is secretly in love with her music teacher, the Chevalier Raphael Danceny , who is penniless and therefore does not qualify in the eyes of her mother as a potential suitor. At his aunt's manor, Valmont tricks Cécile into providing access to her bedchamber so that he can deliver Danceny's love letters unobserved, but instead shows up and rapes her as she pleads with him to leave. Over breakfast the next morning, he taunts a visibly distressed Cécile, and she runs from the room in tears. Later that night, he attempts to enter her room again, but she has barred her door and is seen sobbing within her chamber. Madame de Volanges, distraught by her daughter's sudden state of illness, calls upon Merteuil to speak to Cécile. Merteuil advises Cécile to consensually continue an affair with Valmont, telling her she should take advantage of all the lovers she can acquire in a life so constricted by her gender. Cécile takes her advice and later becomes pregnant with Valmont's child, but suffers a miscarriage, thus avoiding a scandal. Valmont meanwhile steadily targets his main prey, Madame de Tourvel, who, despite suspecting his base motives, eventually gives in to his tireless advances. However, Valmont, the lifelong womanizer, has unexpectedly fallen in love with Tourvel. Merteuil had promised Valmont a night in her company should he be successful in his scheme to seduce Madame de Tourvel and provide written proof of his conquest. Nevertheless, secretly jealous of Tourvel, she refuses to grant Valmont his prize unless he breaks off with Tourvel completely; Merteuil threatens to ruin his proud reputation as a debaucher. Valmont, his ego damaged, heeds her request and coldly leaves Tourvel, who falls desperately ill. Valmont goes back to Merteuil, who in the meantime has taken Chevalier Danceny as her lover. Valmont arranges for Danceny to leave Merteuil for Cecile, which leads to him once again demanding the immediate fulfillment of her promise. The Marquise refuses, and they declare war. The Marquise reveals to Danceny that Valmont had seduced Cécile. Danceny challenges Valmont to a duel. Guilty and despairing, Valmont allows Danceny to fatally wound him. Before he dies, he asks Danceny to visit Tourvel and assure her of his true love; Valmont also hands him a collection of letters from Merteuil that detail her scheming. After hearing Valmont's message from Danceny, Madame de Tourvel dies. Danceny publishes Merteuil's letters, which become a scandal, and she is booed and disgraced by the audience at the opera. The movie closes as she suffers a breakdown while removing her make-up.lovesickness sexuality cheating cynic ladykiller fiancé arranged marriage passion seduction love letter boredom courtly life french revolution lover plan praise gender roles 18th century",False,tt0094947,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,34670720,0,0,1.47648,1.4934829882721732,,,,,59543566.55555555,85788011.0,,0,,,20300291.0,4.0,34700291.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-1310685.0,0.0,1189315.0,1.0,,,,-3100203.0,25899797.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1591545.0,2451545.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10795489.25,25545489.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,28750000.0,50750000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17944803.0,9494803.0,0.5,1.0,47137400.206980206

Following the dismal reception of his latest play, Little Mary, Barrie meets the widowed Sylvia and her four young sons in Kensington Gardens, and a strong friendship develops between them. He proves to be a great playmate and surrogate father figure for the boys, and their imaginative antics give him ideas which he incorporates into a play about boys who do not want to grow up, especially one named after troubled young Peter Llewelyn Davies. His wife Mary, who eventually divorces him, and Sylvia's mother Emma du Maurier, object to the amount of time Barrie spends with the Llewelyn Davies family. Emma also seeks to control her daughter and grandsons, especially as Sylvia becomes increasingly weak from an unidentified illness. Producer Charles Frohman skeptically agrees to mount Peter Pan despite his belief it holds no appeal for upper-class theatergoers. Barrie peppers the opening night audience with children from a nearby orphanage, and the adults present react to their infectious delight with an appreciation of their own. The play proves to be a huge success. Because Sylvia is too ill to attend the production, Barrie arranges to have an abridged production of it performed in her home. She dies shortly afterward, and Barrie finds that her will is to have him and her mother to look after the boys; an arrangement agreeable to both.london, england parent child relationship becoming an adult widow theatre play stroke of fate peter pan theatre group faith author illness",False,tt0308644,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,116766556,0,0,3.67066224,1.9257596443831189,,,69999986.66666667,96013689.2,,,99863007.66666667,18,121863007.66666667,3.0,13952399.833333334,9.0,32285733.166666668,6.0,44994016.5,39.0,59494016.5,2.0,1051794.0,33.0,3251794.0,1.0,,0.0,,,60293714.0,0.0,130293714.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,68617360.5,92804860.5,8.0,,,,,,,,,,-2878717.5,34621282.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,354640427.0,457640427.0,1.0,128505137.0,143755137.0,2.0,,,,80479.0,5580479.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,69437653.06666666,44030986.4,12.375,2.6,84824632.31357588

Desiring his support in obtaining a divorce from the Pope so that Henry VIII of England can marry Anne Boleyn, Wolsey chastises More for being the only member of the Privy Council to argue against him. When More states that the Pope will never grant a divorce, he is scandalised by Wolsey's suggestion that they apply ""pressure"" in order to force the issue. More refuses to support continued efforts to secure an annulment for Henry VIII from the Pope as legal and religious options having been exhausted, provide no grounds for the Pope to issue an annulment. Returning by a River Thames ferry to his home at Chelsea, More finds Richard Rich, a young acquaintance from Cambridge waiting by the dock for his return. An ambitious young man, who is drawn to the allure of power, Rich pleads with More for a position at Court, but More, citing the various corruptions there, advises him to become a teacher instead. Entering the house, More finds his daughter Meg with a young Lutheran named William Roper, who announces his desire to marry her. More, a devout Catholic, announces that his answer is ""no"" as long as Roper remains a heretic. Shortly afterwards, Wolsey dies, banished from Court in disgrace, having failed to coerce a divorce from the Pope. King Henry appoints More as Lord Chancellor of England. Soon after, the King makes an ""impromptu"" visit by barge at More's home in Chelsea to inquire about his divorce. Sir Thomas, not wishing to admit that his conscience forbids him to dissolve what he considers a valid marriage, remains unmoved as the King alternates thinly-veiled threats with promises of unbounded Royal favour. When More finally refers to Catherine as ""the Queen,"" the King explodes into a raging tantrum. Storming off in a huff, King Henry returns to his barge and orders the oarsmen to cast off. His courtiers are left to run through the mud and into the river to catch up as the King laughs hysterically at their predicament. At the embankment, Rich is approached by Thomas Cromwell, a member of Henry's court and political adversary of More. Cromwell subtly inquires whether Rich has information that could damage More's reputation, in exchange for a position at Court. Roper, learning of More's quarrel with the King, reveals that his religious opinions have altered considerably. He declares that by attacking the Catholic Church, the King has become ""the Devil's minister."" An alarmed More admonishes him to be more guarded as Rich arrives, pleading again for a position at Court. When More again refuses, Rich denounces More's steward as a spy for Cromwell. Now, More and his family, including wife Alice learn the ugly truth: Rich is being manipulated by Cromwell to spy on him. As a humiliated Rich leaves, More's family pleads with him to have Rich arrested. More refuses, stating that Rich, while dangerous, has broken no law. Still seeking a position at Court, Rich enlists Cromwell's patronage and joins him in attempting to bring down More. Henry, tired of awaiting for an annulment from the Vatican, redefines the Catholic Church in England by declaring himself ""Supreme Head of the Church in England."" He demands that both the bishops and Parliament renounce all allegiance to the Holy See. More quietly resigns his post as Chancellor rather than accept the new order. As he does so, his close friend, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, attempts to draw his opinions out as part of a friendly chat with no witnesses present. More, however, knows that the time for speaking openly of such matters is over. The King will not be appeased. It is suggested that More attend his wedding to Anne Boleyn. More declines and is summoned again to Hampton Court, now occupied by Cromwell. More is interrogated on his opinions but refuses to answer, citing it as his right under English Law. Cromwell angrily declares that the King now views him as a traitor. More returns home and is met by his daughter. Meg informs him that a new oath about the marriage is being circulated and that all must take it on pain of high treason. Initially, More says he would be willing to take the oath, provided it does not conflict with his principles. One issue for More is that the King cannot declare himself to be the head of the Catholic Church as the head of the Catholic Church is the Pope. However, an expert in the law, More knows that if he does not state why he is opposed to taking the oath, he cannot be considered a traitor to the King; More refuses to take the oath and is imprisoned in the Tower of London regardless. In spite of the bullying tactics of Cromwell, the subtle manipulation of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer and the pleadings of both Norfolk and his family, More remains steadfast in his refusal to take the oath. When he is finally brought to trial, he remains silent until after being convicted of treason on the perjured testimony of Richard Rich. He is then informed that Rich had been appointed as Attorney General for Wales as a reward. Now having nothing left to lose, More angrily denounces the illegal nature of the King's actions, citing the Biblical basis for the authority of the Papacy over Christendom. He further declares that the immunity of the Church from State interference is guaranteed both in Magna Carta and in the King's own Coronation Oath. As the spectators scream in protest, More is condemned to death. A narrator intones the epilogue. :Thomas More's head was stuck on Traitor's Gate for a month. Then his daughter, Margaret, removed it and kept it 'til her death. Cromwell was beheaded for high treason five years after More. The Archbishop was burned at the stake. The Duke of Norfolk should have been executed for high treason but the King died of syphilis the night before.

A narrative framing device, set in the late 1940s to early 1950s, involves KGB Lieutenant General Yevgraf Andreyevich Zhivago  searching for the daughter of his half brother, doctor Yuri Andreyevich Zhivago , and Larissa  Antipova . Yevgraf believes a young woman, Tonya Komarovskaya  may be his niece, and tells her the story of her father's life. When Yuri Zhivago is orphaned after his mother's death, he is taken in by his mother's friends, Alexander 'Sasha'  and Anna  Gromeko — and grows up with their daughter Tonya. Years later, Zhivago, a medical student by training, and a poet in heart, meets Tonya  again when she returns as a young lady from Paris to Moscow. Lara, meanwhile, engaged to the idealistic Pavel Pavlovich  Antipov , is seduced by Victor Ipolitovich Komarovsky , a friend of her mother's . Pasha drifts into left-wing extremism after being wounded by sabre-wielding Cossacks during a peaceful protest. Pasha goes to Lara to treat his wound and asks her to hide a gun he picked up at the demonstration. Lara's mother discovers her affair with Komarovsky and attempts suicide. Komarovsky summons help and Zhivago arrives as the physician's assistant. When Komarovsky learns of Lara's intentions to marry Pasha, he tries to dissuade Lara, and then rapes her. In revenge, Lara takes the pistol she has been hiding for Pasha and shoots Komarovsky at a Christmas Eve party, wounding him. Komarovsky insists that no action be taken against Lara, who is escorted out by Pasha. Yuri attends to Komarovsky's wound. Although enraged and devastated by Lara's infidelity, Pasha still marries Lara, and they have a daughter, Katya. During World War I, Yevgraf Zhivago is sent by Russian Social Democratic Labour Party to subvert the Imperial Russian Army for the Bolsheviks. Pasha is missing in action following a daring charge attack on German forces. Lara enlists as a nurse in order to search for him. Yuri becomes a battlefield doctor. When the February Revolution breaks, Zhivago enlists Lara's help to tend to the wounded, and together they run a field hospital in a dacha for six months, during which time radical changes ensue throughout Russia, as the October Revolution breaks out and Vladimir Lenin arrives in Moscow. After the war, Yuri returns to his wife Tonya, son Sasha, and father-in-law, whose house in Moscow has been divided into tenements by the new Soviet government. His half-brother Yevgraf, who is now working for the CHEKA, finds him, and informs him that his poems have been condemned by Soviet censors as antagonistic to Communism. Yevgraf helps arrange for rail passes for Yuri and his family to escape to the Gromeko estate at Varykino, in the Ural Mountains. Zhivago, Tonya, Sasha and Alexander board a heavily-guarded cattle train, during which time they are informed that they'll be traveling in the midst of contested territory being secured by a Bolshevik commander named Strelnikov. On the way, while the train is stopped, Zhivago wanders away from the train, and stumbles across the armored train of Strelnikov himself, sitting on a hidden siding. Yuri recognizes Strelnikov as Pasha Antipov. After a tense interview, Strelnikov informs Yuri that Lara is living with her daughter Katya in the town of Yuriatin — which is then occupied by the anti-Communist White Army. He allows Zhivago to return to his family, although it is hinted by a guard that most people interrogated by Strelnikov end up being shot. The family lives a peaceful life at Varykino, until Zhivago finds Lara in the nearby Yuriatin. They surrender to their long repressed feelings, beginning an extra-marital affair. When Tonya is pregnant, Zhivago breaks off with Lara, only to be abducted and conscripted into service by Communist partisans. After two years, Zhivago deserts, trudging through the snow to Yuriatin. Lara reveals a letter from Tonya, in which she tells Yuri that she, her father, and Sasha have emigrated to Paris, and had met with Lara while searching for the long-lost Yuri. She writes, partly, ""I must honestly admit that {Lara} Antipova is a good person."" Zhivago decides to stay with Lara. Komarovsky arrives one night and informs them that they are being watched by the CHEKA, due to Lara's marriage to Commissar Strelnikov  and Yuri's ""counter-revolutionary"" poetry and desertion. Komarovsky offers Yuri and Lara his help in leaving Russia, but they refuse. Instead, they go to the desolate Varykino estate. Yuri begins writing the ""Lara"" poems, which will later make him famous but incur governmental displeasure. Komarovsky reappears and tells Yuri that Strelnikov committed suicide while being taken to his execution. Therefore, Lara is in immediate danger, as the CHEKA had apparently only left her free to lure Strelnikov into the open. Zhivago agrees to send Lara away with Komarovsky, who has become an official in the Far East. Refusing to leave with a man he despises, Yuri remains behind. Years later, during the Stalinist era, Yuri sees Lara while traveling on a tram. Forcing his way off the tram, he runs after her, at which point he suffers a fatal heart attack. Yuri's funeral is well attended, as his poetry is already being published openly due to shifts in politics. Lara informs Yevgraf that she has given birth to Yuri's daughter, but lost her in the collapse of the White-controlled government in Mongolia. After vainly looking over hundreds of orphans with Yevgraf's help, Lara disappears during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge, and ""died or vanished somewhere, in one of the labour camps"", according to Yevgraf. While Yevgraf strongly believes that Tanya Komarovskaya is Yuri and Lara's daughter, she is still not convinced. Yevgraf notices that Tanya carries with her a balalaika. He recalls that Yuri's mother left him one after her death. Finding that Tanya learned to play the balalaika by herself, he smiles, ""Ah, then, it's a gift,"" thereby implying that she truly must be their daughter after all.love triangle nurse loss of loved one suicide attempt world war i forbidden love step parents daughter epic russian revolution",False,tt0059113,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,111858363,0,0,9.168942090909091,-4.6130022603713225,129500.0,1700500.0,,,,,54995385.0,3,69995385.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,48451692.5,8.0,57451692.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,54995385.0,69995385.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,48451692.5,57451692.5,2.0,54995385.0,69995385.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,54995385.0,69995385.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,54995385.0,69995385.0,1.0,,,,54995385.0,69995385.0,1.0,,,,26946192.5,35330192.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,63723538.75,51723538.75,1.375,1.5,90759089.06047031

Ripper  is commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, which houses the SAC B-52 airborne alert bomber force just hours from the Soviet border. Ripper orders his executive officer, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the RAF , to put the base on alert, asserting that it is not a drill. The alert is sent to the patrolling aircraft, including one piloted by Aircraft commander Major T. J. ""King"" Kong  and his crew. All the aircraft commence an attack flight on Russia, and lock out unauthorized external communications through the CRM 114 Discriminator. Mandrake discovers that no order for war has been received, and tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper reveals to Mandrake that he believes the Soviets have been using fluoridation of United States' water supplies to pollute the ""precious bodily fluids"" of Americans. At The Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson  briefs President Merkin Muffley  in the ""War Room"" along with several other top officers and aides about the attack. Muffley is shocked to learn that such orders could be given without his authorization, although he had OK'ed this in the case of Soviet first-strike attack on Washington D.C. Turgidson reports that his men are trying to cycle through every CRM code to issue the stand-down order but this could take over two days. Muffley orders Turgidson to storm the base and seize Ripper, though Turgidson warns that Ripper may have already alerted his men to this possibility. Gen. Turgidson attempts to convince Muffley to let the attack continue, as their first strike on the Soviets would wipe out the majority of the Soviet missiles, and the little they could retaliate with would only cost a few million American lives. Muffley refuses, and instead brings in the Soviet ambassador Alexei de Sadeski  to get Soviet premier Dimitri Kisov on the ""Hot Line"". The President alerts the Premier to the situation, and authorizes the USSR to fire upon the US planes to stop the attack. After a heated discussion, the ambassador explains that the Soviet Union has created a doomsday device consisting of 50 buried bombs with ""Cobalt Thorium G"" set to detonate should any nuclear attack strike their country; the Soviets had conceived of this after reading a New York Times article claiming the United States was also working on such a device. The President's wheelchair-bound scientific advisor, a sinister German named Dr. Strangelove , considers that this is a ploy, as a secret doomsday device would be an ineffectual deterrent. Sadeski admits they had plans to reveal its existence the following week, as a surprise for the Premier's birthday.  U.S. Army airborne forces arrive at Burpelson, but as predicted, the base's troops consider the troops to be Soviets in disguise and open fire. Despite many casualties, the Army forces eventually overtake the base. Before he can be restrained, Ripper shoots himself. Colonel ""Bat"" Guano  forces his way into Ripper's office. He initially suspects Mandrake of being an enemy, but Mandrake convinces him otherwise. Mandrake has identified the proper recall code for the bombers from Ripper's desk blotter doodles, and SAC is able to contact the bomber planes and send them away from Soviet air space. The War Room celebrates. However, Sadeski reports that of the four planes that the Soviets had believed shot down, they cannot account for one of them - that of Major Kong. Anti-aircraft fire had ruptured the fuel tank and caused the CRM aboard Kong's plane to self-destruct, leaving the crew no way to receive the counter-order. President Muffley gives the plane's original destination to the Soviets, to allow them to concentrate on finding it. However, due to the fuel loss, Major Kong has changed the destination to a closer high-priority target, a ICBM complex at Kodlosk. On approaching the new target, the crew discovers that the bomb release mechanism has been damaged. Major Kong tries to repair the damage, but ends up falling out of the plane along with the bomb; he straddles the bomb and rides it like a rodeo cowboy as it falls and detonates. While discussing the aftereffects of the activation of the doomsday device, Sadeski notes that, within ten months, the surface of the earth will be uninhabitable. Dr. Strangelove recommends that the President gather several hundreds of thousands of people, with a high female-to-male ratio, to live in deep mineshafts in order to escape the radiation, and to then institute a breeding program to allow the United States to repopulate the surface after a hundred years have passed. Gen. Turgidson warns that the Soviets will likely do the same. At this point, Dr. Strangelove suddenly shouts that he has a plan, and miraculously gets up from his wheelchair, takes a few halting steps and shouts, ""Mein Führer! I can walk!""

In 1935, T. E. Lawrence  is killed in a motorcycle accident. At his memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, reporters try to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him, with little success. During the First World War, Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant stationed in Cairo, notable for his insolence and knowledge of the Bedouin. Over the objections of General Murray , he is sent by Mr. Dryden  of the Arab Bureau to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal  in his revolt against the Turks. On the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali  for drinking from a well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton , who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment of Faisal's camp, and leave. Lawrence promptly ignores Brighton's commands when he meets Faisal. His knowledge and outspokenness pique the Prince's interest. Brighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba which, if successful, would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. While strongly fortified against a naval assault, the town is lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali. Two teenage orphans, Daud  and Farraj , attach themselves to Lawrence as his servants. They cross the Nefud Desert, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. Gasim  succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. The rest make it to an oasis, but Lawrence turns back for the lost man, risking his own life and winning over Sherif Ali after saving Gasim. Lawrence persuades Auda abu Tayi , the leader of the powerful local Howeitat tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's plan is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a blood feud. Since Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, Lawrence declares that he will execute the murderer himself. Stunned to discover that the culprit is Gasim, he shoots him anyway. The next morning, the intact alliance overruns the Turkish garrison. Lawrence heads to Cairo to inform Dryden and the new commander, General Allenby , of his victory. During the crossing of the Sinai Desert, Daud dies when he stumbles into quicksand. Lawrence is promoted to major and given arms and money to support the Arabs. He is deeply disturbed, confessing that he enjoyed executing Gasim, but Allenby brushes aside his qualms. He asks Allenby whether there is any basis for the Arabs' suspicions that the British have designs on Arabia. Pressed, the general states they have no such designs.  Lawrence launches a guerrilla war, blowing up trains and harassing the Turks at every turn. American war correspondent Jackson Bentley ([[Arthur Kennedy  publicizes his exploits, making him world famous. On one raid, Farraj is badly injured. Unwilling to leave him to be tortured, Lawrence is forced to shoot him before fleeing. When Lawrence scouts the enemy-held city of Daraa with Ali, he is taken, along with several Arab residents, to the Turkish Bey . Lawrence is stripped, ogled and prodded. For striking out at the Bey, he is severely flogged, then thrown out into the street. Lawrence is so traumatized by the experience that he abandons all of his exploits, going from having proclaimed himself a god, to insisting he is merely a man. He attempts to return to the British forces and swear off the desert, but he never fits in there. In Jerusalem, Allenby urges him to support his ""big push"" on Damascus, but Lawrence is a changed, tormented man, unwilling to return. After Allenby insists that Lawrence has a destiny, he finally relents. Lawrence naively believes that the warriors will come for him rather than for money. He recruits an army, mainly killers, mercenaries, and cutthroats motivated by money, rather than the Arab cause. They sight a column of retreating Turkish soldiers who have just slaughtered the people of Tafas. One of Lawrence's men from the village demands, ""No prisoners!"" When Lawrence hesitates, the man charges the Turks alone and is killed. Lawrence takes up the dead man's cry, resulting in a massacre in which Lawrence himself participates with relish. Afterward, he realizes the horrible consequences of what he has done. His men then take Damascus ahead of Allenby's forces. The Arabs set up a council to administer the city, but they are desert tribesmen, ill-suited for such a task. The various tribes argue among themselves and in spite of Lawrence's insistence, cannot unite against the English, who in the end take the city back under their bureaucracy. Unable to maintain the utilities and bickering constantly with each other, they soon abandon most of the city to the British. Promoted to colonel and immediately ordered home, his usefulness at an end to both Faisal and the British diplomats, a dejected Lawrence is driven away in a staff car.cairo arabian world war i horse jerusalem british army british empire damascus camel war based on a true story quicksand desert arab ottoman empire",False,tt0056172,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,69995385,0,0,3.6663589999999995,4.1232103568370615,41908000.0,44908000.0,,,,,,0,,,41908000.0,5.0,44908000.0,1.0,22900000.0,1.0,28900000.0,1.0,41908000.0,5.0,44908000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-1103000.0,4.0,665000.0,1.0,22900000.0,1.0,28900000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41908000.0,44908000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,20477460.5,22477460.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1103000.0,665000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1103000.0,665000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,29656200.0,25702600.0,2.0,1.0,64721690.498195834

Almost immediately, there is tension between the couple as David becomes immersed in his academic work and differing ideas regarding the nature of their relationship come to light: David wants the traditional division of tasks, with the man earning wages, and the wife satisfying his needs in the kitchen and bed. Amy wants greater participation from David if she is going to accept such a role: she wants him to perform all the traditionally male tasks, like fixing the toaster, but also to involve himself in her community. Chris Cawsey ([[Jim Norton , Norman Scutt , Riddaway , and Amy's former lover, Charlie Venner , are Wakely locals hired to renovate the Sumners' isolated farmhouse. They openly resent David for his intellectual pursuits, and persistently harass him. When Amy discovers their cat strangled and hanging by a light chain in their bedroom closet, Amy claims the workmen did it to intimidate David. She presses him to confront the villagers, but he refuses. David tries to win their friendship, and they invite him to go hunting in the woods the next day. During the trip, David is taken to a remote forest meadow and left there, after the workmen promise to drive the birds towards him. Having ditched David, Venner returns to the couple's farmhouse where he rapes Amy. Scutt arrives, forces Venner to hold Amy down, and rapes Amy as well. After several hours, David realizes he's been tricked and returns home to find a disheveled and withdrawn Amy. She does not tell him about the rapes. The next day, David fires the workmen, claiming that they have performed poorly and wasted time. Later that week, the Sumners attend a church social where Amy becomes distraught after seeing the men who raped her. They leave the social early, and, while driving home through thick fog, accidentally hit the local village idiot Henry Niles ([[David Warner , whom they take to their home. David phones the local pub about the accident. However, earlier that evening Niles had accidentally strangled a flirtatious young girl from the village, Janice Hedden , and now her father, the town drunkard, Tom , and the workmen looking for him are alerted by the phone call to Niles's whereabouts. Soon the drunken locals, including Amy's rapists, are pounding on the door of the Sumners' home. After a few minutes of their breaking the windows and hammering on the door, the local magistrate, Major John Scott , arrives and after attempting to defuse the situation, is shot dead by Tom. At this point the father and the workmen agree that they cannot go back on what they have done, but only continue. David realizes that they will not allow anyone in the house to live and begins preparing to defend his home. First he heats two saucepans of cooking oil. Then, when one of the locals attempts to enter through the window, he ties his hands together at knifepoint. As more men appear at another window, he scalds them with the boiling oil, temporarily incapacitating them. Then he lays down a large mantrap in his living room and sends Amy upstairs to hide. When Tom and Cawsey enter and attempt to shoot David, he knocks the shotgun out of Tom's hands, causing it to fire and mangle the man's foot, mortally wounding him. He then engages in a fight with Cawsey, beating him to death with a fire poker. Finally, Charlie appears and holds David at gunpoint, but before he can shoot him, the two hear Amy screaming. As they both run upstairs, the fifth man, Scutt, is there. He tells Charlie to take David downstairs and kill him, so they can rape Amy again. Instead, Charlie shoots Scutt and David begins to fight Charlie. As they reach the living room, David, despite Amy's pleas not to, kills Charlie by springing the mantrap over his head, crushing his neck. As David looks at the carnage around him, he murmurs, ""Jesus, I got 'em all."" He is then attacked by another villager and, losing the struggle, asks Amy to fetch the shotgun and shoot him. Amy hesitates before retrieving the weapon and shooting the villager. David is driving Niles to town when the latter turns and says, ""I don't know my way home."" David smiles and replies, ""That's okay. I don't either.""england rape based on novel or book country life primal fear cornwall england revenge thriller rural area violence english countryside cult film",False,tt0067800,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,3251794,0,0,0.4780881818181818,9.732470303796497,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,65437336.942640275

A 50-foot containment wall surrounds the island, and mines have been placed on all the bridges and tunnels to the island. The surrounding waters are patrolled and no civilians, even prison guards, are allowed to step foot on the island. Nine years later , while traveling to a three-way summit between the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, Air Force One is hijacked by a terrorist disguised as a stewardess. The plane crashes into Manhattan, but the President  makes it to an escape pod and survives. The inmates take him hostage and order all recovery forces to leave Manhattan immediately or they will kill him. Police Commissioner Bob Hauk  offers a deal to special forces soldier turned criminal ""Snake"" Plissken : If he rescues the president and retrieves a secret cassette tape within 24 hours, Hauk will give him a full pardon. When Plissken reluctantly agrees to attempt the rescue, Hauk has him injected with microscopic explosives that will rupture his carotid arteries in 24 hours. The explosives can only be defused in the last 15 minutes before they detonate, ensuring that Snake does not abandon his mission. If he returns with the President and the tape in time for the summit, Hauk will save him.  Snake lands atop the World Trade Center in a stealth glider, and locates the plane wreckage and escape pod. He tracks the President's life-monitor bracelet signal to a theater, only to find it on the wrist of an old man. He meets an inmate nicknamed ""Cabbie"" , who takes Snake to see Harold ""Brain"" Hellman , who has made the New York Public Library his personal fortress. Brain, who knows Snake, tells him that the self-proclaimed ""Duke of New York"" , has the President and plans to lead a mass escape across the mined and heavily guarded 69th Street Bridge, using the President as a human shield. Snake forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie  to lead him to the Duke's compound at Grand Central Station. Snake finds the President in a railroad car, but he is captured by the Duke's men. While Snake is forced to fight with a prisoner named Slag , Brain and Maggie trick the Duke's right-hand man Romero  into letting them see the President. Once inside, they kill Romero and the guards, free the President, and flee. When the Duke learns this, he is furious and rounds up his gang to chase them down. In the confusion, Snake slips away and manages to catch up with Brain, Maggie and the President. After a group of crazies cuts the ropes on Snake's glider and push it off the top of the World Trade Center, the group heads back down and encounters Cabbie, who offers to take them across the bridge in his cab. When Cabbie reveals that he has the secret tape, the President demands it, but Snake takes it. With the Duke chasing in another car, Snake and the others drive over the mine-strewn bridge. The cab is destroyed by a land mine and Cabbie is killed. As they flee on foot, Brain is killed by a mine and Maggie refuses to leave him, taking Snake's gun and firing several shots at the Duke's approaching car before he runs her over. Snake and the President reach the wall, and the guards raise the President on a rope. The Duke kills the guards and attacks Snake, but the President shoots the Duke dead. Snake is lifted to safety, and the explosives are deactivated with seconds to spare. As the President prepares for a televised speech, he thanks Snake for saving him. Snake asks him how he feels about the people who died saving his life, but the President only offers half-hearted regret, to Snake's disgust. Hauk tries to offer Snake a job, but he refuses and walks away. The President's speech commences and he offers the content of the cassette to the summit; but to the President's embarrassment, the tape has been switched for a cassette of the swing song ""Bandstand Boogie,"" Cabbie's favorite song. Snake receives his pardon and leaves the prison, tearing apart the real tape.taxi street gang u.s. president war veteran hostage kidnapping liberation of prisoners anti hero gangster dystopia police operation attempt to escape cyberpunk cult film reluctant hero",False,tt0082340,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,50244700,1,0,7.3741166666666675,4.391301574055172,2713768.0,3713768.0,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,102084787.0,14.0,111584787.0,1.0,,0.0,,,93931801.0,2.0,104931801.0,1.0,39900000.0,14.0,45300000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,87272196.0,78638862.66666667,3.75,1.0,59926399.23225083

Dr. Damien O'Donovan  is about to leave his native village to practice medicine in a London hospital. Meanwhile, his brother Teddy  commands the local flying column of the Irish Republican Army. After a hurling match, Damien witnesses the summary execution of his friend, Micheál Ó Súilleabháin, by British Black and Tans. Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the British Army vainly trying to intimidate a railway guard and the train driver for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade. After drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's Royal Irish Constabulary barracks for revolvers, then uses them to assassinate four Auxiliaries. In the aftermath, Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Hamilton  coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly , into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps. As a result, the entire brigade is taken arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan ([[Liam Cunningham , a union official who shares Damien's socialist views. Meanwhile, British officers interrogate Teddy, pulling out his fingernails when he refuses to give names of IRA members. Later, Johnny Gogan , a British soldier of Irish descent, helps all but three of the prisoners escape. After the actions of Sir John and Chris are revealed to the IRA's intelligence network, both are taken hostage. As Teddy is still recovering, Damien is temporarily placed in command. News arrives that the three remaining IRA prisoners have been tortured and shot. Simultaneously, the brigade receives orders to, ""Execute the spies."" Despite the fact that Chris is a lifelong friend, a shattered Damien shoots both him and Sir John. Later, Damien tells his sweetheart, Cumann na mBan member Sinéad Sullivan , about the shame of facing Chris's mother. After the IRA ambushes and wipes out an armed convoy of the Auxiliary Division, another detachment of Auxiliaries loots and burns the farmhouse of Sinéad's family in retaliation. Sinéad is held at gunpoint while her head is shaved. Later, as Damien comforts her, a messenger arrives with news of a formal ceasefire between Britain and the IRA. While the village celebrates, Damien and Sinéad steal away for a romantic interlude. After the Anglo-Irish Treaty is signed, the brigade learns that a partitioned Ireland will only be granted Dominion status within the British Empire. As a result, the brigade divides over the terms. Teddy and his allies argue that accepting the Treaty will bring peace now while further gains can be made later. Others oppose the Treaty, proposing to continue fighting until a united Irish Republic can be obtained. Dan and Damien further demand the collectivisation of industry and agriculture. Any other course, declares Dan, will change only, ""the accents of the powerful and the colour of the flag."" Not all Anti-Treaty Republicans are depicted as agreeing, however. Later, the Irish Free State replaces British rule and Teddy and his allies begin patrolling in Irish Army uniforms. Meanwhile, Damien and his allies join the Anti-Treaty IRA. When the civil war begins in Dublin, the Anti-Treaty column commences guerilla tactics against the Free State. As the violence escalates, Teddy expresses fear that the British will invade if the Republicans gain the upper hand. He decrees, ""They take one out, we take one back. To hell with the courts."" Ultimately, Dan is killed and Damien is captured during a raid for arms on a Free State barracks commanded by Teddy. Sentenced to death, Damien is held in the same cell where the British Army imprisoned them earlier. Hoping to avoid executing his brother, Teddy pleads with Damien to reveal where the IRA is hiding the stolen rifles, offering him full amnesty, a vision of Ireland at peace, and a life with Sinéad. Damien responds, ""I shot Chris Reilly in the heart. I did that. You know why. I am not going to sell out."" Devastated, Teddy leaves the cell in tears. Writing a goodbye letter to Sinéad, Damien declares his love for her, saying that he knows what he stands for and is not afraid. At dawn, Damien is marched before a firing squad. As both brothers fight back tears, Teddy gives the order, the squad fires, and Damien crumples to the ground. That afternoon, Teddy delivers Damien's letter to Sinéad. Enraged and heartbroken, she flails uselessly against Teddy, then orders him to leave. Sinéad falls to her knees mourning Damien, while Teddy mournfully walks away.sibling relationship england civil war resistance guerrilla underground traitor mercenary independence british army british empire dublin irish civil war peace weapon ira (irish republican army) ireland colonialism",True,tt0460989,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,22889018,0,0,2.5213873846153847,-3.847336948521819,,,,,,,83267413.25,4,126267413.25,4.0,,0.0,,,-6595000.0,10.0,405000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,12039851.25,37039851.25,4.0,,,,,,,167956767.16666666,228956767.16666666,6.0,,,,,,,46472873.0,69972873.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,63336206.625,38336206.625,1.75,2.5,92887866.92008553

Vos is in charge of locating the perpetrators of a recent bomb attack against the Secunda CTL synthetic fuel refinery, which is the largest coal liquefaction plant in the world. Patrick is unwillingly swept into Vos's investigation due to his inability to provide a satisfactory explanation for his whereabouts at the time of the bombing . Eventually Patrick, his wife, Precious, , and his family are tortured and savagely abused by Vos and Vos's subordinates. Desperate, Patrick says that he is willing to confess to a crime he did not commit to protect his family from torture. At last, Vos finally concludes that Patrick is innocent, and orders his release. Fueled by the anger at the injustices he and his family suffered, Patrick joins the Umkhonto we Sizwe, the guerrilla military wing of the African National Congress and becomes exactly what Vos had initially accused him of being. This decision was an act of revenge against the government for killing his friend, tormenting not only himself, but his wife as well. He attempts to execute a plan to attack Secunda, the refinery he used to work for, by first bombing its adjacent water supply facilities, and 15 minutes later triggering the main explosion within the refinery itself. This would allow the refinery's workforce to flee between the two explosions, and not be harmed. Also, the damage of the first bomb would reduce the possibility of successfully extinguishing the fire caused by the second, main explosion. Patrick succeeds in the first part, but the second bomb is discovered by Vos and deactivated. Patrick is arrested and sentenced to 24 years in prison, after his wife goes to Vos and tells him where Patrick is, because she fell for a simple trick in which Vos left photographs of Patrick talking to a female member of the ANC. Through her unjust jealousy she sells him out. He is released early due to the abolition of apartheid. Precious, who has remarried, is waiting for him and apologizes, and Patrick forgives her and he says he is sorry as well. Some time later, he has been trying to adjust to normal life but the pain he felt wouldn't leave him. One day, he sees Vos sitting out near a small body of water opposite to the side he and friends are on.

The Queen  is slightly wary of Blair and his pledge to ""modernise"" the country, but Blair promises to respect the Royal Family. Three months later, Diana, Princess of Wales dies in a car crash in the Alma Bridge tunnel in Paris along with her companion Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul. Blair's director of communications, Alastair Campbell , prepares a speech in which Diana is described as ""the people's princess"". Blair gives his speech the next day and the phrase catches on. Over the next few days, millions of people across London display an outpouring of grief at Buckingham and Kensington Palaces. Meanwhile, the Royal Family are still at Balmoral Castle, their summer estate in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Diana's death sparks division among numerous members of the family. The Royal Family observes that, since Diana was divorced from her husband, Prince Charles  a year earlier, she is no longer a part of the family. They insist that Diana's funeral is a ""private affair"" and is best left to Diana's noble family, the Spencers. Charles argues that the mother of a future king cannot be dismissed so lightly, and the Queen allows the use of an aircraft of the British Royal Flight to bring Diana's body back to England. In London, flowers pile up along the palace railings, forcing the changing of the Queen's guard to use another gate. British tabloids become inflammatory about the lack of a statement from the Royal Family. Charles leaves no doubt that he shares Blair's views about the need for a statement. As the Royal Family's ratings plummet, Blair's popularity rises, to the delight of his anti-monarchist advisers and wife Cherie . However, Blair does not share these sentiments. While disagreeing with the Queen's course of action, Blair begins to develop an admiration for her. Blair disagrees with his wife's views and tells her that a republican Britain is ludicrous, and begins to denounce the anti-royal disdain of his Labour Party advisors. Blair calls the Queen at Balmoral and recommends strong measures to regain public confidence for the monarchy: attend a public funeral for Diana at Westminster Abbey, fly a Union flag at half mast over Buckingham Palace, and speak to the nation about Diana's life and legacy in a televised address. Blair's recommendations outrage several other members of the Royal Family including Prince Philip  and the Queen Mother . Philip is surprised that Elton John is asked to attend and sing a song, ""Candle in the Wind"" in Diana's memory. They view such steps as an undignified surrender to public hysteria. The Queen seems concerned about this and although she shares their feelings, she has doubts as she closely follows the news. The Queen believes that there has been a shift in public values and that perhaps she should abdicate. The Queen Mother dismisses the idea, saying that she is one of the greatest assets her monarchy has ever had, stating: ""The real problem will come when you leave"". She also reminds the Queen of the promise she made in Cape Town, South Africa on her 21st birthday, in which she promised that her ""whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong..."" Meanwhile, Philip attempts to distract William and Harry  from Diana's death by taking them deer stalking. While venturing out alone in her Land Rover, the Queen damages the vehicle while crossing a river and is forced to telephone for assistance. The Queen weeps in frustration, but catches sight of a majestic Red Deer which Philip, William, and Harry have been stalking. She is struck by his beauty and the two stare at each other. Hearing a distant gunshot, she shoos the animal away. The Queen decides to carry out Blair's recommendations. While preparing to return to London to attend Diana's public funeral, the Queen is horrified to learn that the deer has been killed on a neighbouring estate. She asks to see the stag and is upset at its loss. The Royal Family finally return to London to inspect the floral tributes, and while watching live television coverage along with his staff, Blair becomes angry and disappointed at his Labour Party advisors, for which he states that the Queen is admirable, and thinks that Diana had thrown everything she offered back in her face and seemed to destroy everything held most dear by the Queen. The Queen later follows Blair's advice and gives her public statement, speaking about Diana's life and legacy on live television and describing Diana as ""an exceptional and gifted human being"". Two months after Diana's death, Blair visits Buckingham Palace for a weekly meeting. The Queen finally regained her popularity, but she believes that Blair has benefited himself from her acquiescence to his advice and that she will never fully recover from ""that week"". The Queen cautions Blair that one day, he will find that public opinion can rapidly turn against him and declares that times have changed and that the monarchy must ""modernise"". When Blair suggests that he can help with this, the Queen replies: ""Don't get ahead of yourself, Prime Minister. Remember, I'm supposed to be the one advising you"".upper class loss of loved one great britain sadness queen monarchy paparazzi headline dying and death palace prince charles royal family biography deer based on a true story british prime minister princess diana 1990s queen elizabeth ii",False,tt0436697,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,123384128,1,0,7.225608533333332,-3.847336948521819,,,-2123648.0,9043018.666666666,,,58235489.0,25,80935489.0,4.0,38062606.25,4.0,91812606.25,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,16389018.0,0.0,22889018.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,34680133.333333336,94680133.33333333,3.0,12938899.0,28938899.0,2.0,,,,,,,83639519.75,121639519.75,4.0,-2776474.6666666665,9556858.666666666,3.0,13129520.0,28082853.333333332,3.0,-5067854.0,9932146.0,1.0,44370733.5,62870733.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,-5703641.0,7963025.666666667,3.0,,,,5193068.0,26193068.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-49867.0,9950133.0,1.0,,,,20989051.5,28989051.5,2.0,-16879824.5,33120175.5,2.0,3261608.0,8761608.0,1.0,22150183.0,82150183.0,1.0,138489208.0,183489208.0,2.0,,,65212371.083333336,37562371.083333336,3.625,3.0,92887866.92008553

Twenty years later, Lord Darlington  has died and his stately country manor has been sold to a retired American Congressman, Mr. Lewis . Kenton reveals that her marriage has failed and that she is nostalgic for the days when she worked at the house. Stevens  goes to visit Miss Kenton, ostensibly to persuade her to return to service. The film flashes back to Kenton's arrival as housekeeper. At the time, Darlington Hall was frequented by many politicians of the interwar period, men who decided important affairs of state while there. Stevens, loyal and perfectionistic, calm and efficient, had to manage the household so that the servants seemed almost invisible, and he took great pride in his skills and his profession. He clashed with Miss Kenton, his equal in the household hierarchy, but displayed only understated irritation with her and others. Indeed, his utter focus and emotional repression were most fully displayed when his own father, also an employee, was dying; Stevens continued his duties without pause. Miss Kenton was equally efficient and strong-willed but warmer and less repressed. Relations between the two eventually warmed and Kenton even teased Stevens. It becomes clear that she had fallen in love with him, and perhaps he with her, though his feelings are left ambiguous. She tried to break through the wall, but Stevens' coldness was too formidable. Finally, she struck up a relationship with another man and married him, leaving the house just before the outbreak of World War II. Before her departure, she insulted Stevens, clearly out of distress that he had never expressed any emotional interest in her, but he still refused to be moved. When she cried in frustration, the only response he could muster was to call her attention to a domestic task. Lord Darlington used his influence to broker the policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany, based on his belief that Germany had been unfairly treated by the Treaty of Versailles following World War I. Most of his guests at a series of conferences and meetings were like-minded British and European aristocrats. The exception was the American Congressman Lewis, depicted as younger and much more worldly than other dignitaries. He eventually lost patience with Lord Darlington's naive schemes and argued in favour of the foreign policy being conducted by ""professionals"" rather than by ""gentlemen amateurs"" . After reading the work of Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Lord Darlington commanded that two German-Jewish maids should be dismissed, considering their employment inappropriate. Stevens carried out the order but Miss Kenton almost resigned in protest, fearing that the girls would have to return to Germany; her own need for employment caused her to avoid following through. Darlington later regretted his decision and asked Stevens to reinstate the maids, but they could not be located. Darlington died a broken man, his reputation destroyed after he had been denounced a traitor in the Daily Mail . When asked about his former employer, Stevens at first denies having served or even met him but later admits to having served him. He recognizes his former master's failings and indicates that he has regrets about his own life, as does Miss Kenton . However, Kenton declines Stevens' offer to return to Darlington Hall, announcing instead that she wants to remain with her husband, since their daughter is soon to present them with a grandchild. After the meeting, Stevens departs for Darlington Hall in a downpour of rain. Kenton cries, while Stevens, still unable to demonstrate any feeling, simply raises his hat. The film's final scene shows Stevens making the final preparations to Darlington Hall in preparation for the arrival of Congressman Lewis' family. As the two men enter the banquet hall, where a table tennis table now lies, Congressman Lewis reflects on the banquet that he attended in this room in 1935 and admits embarrassment over his comments . He asks Stevens if he remembers the comments, to which Stevens replies that he was too busy serving. Symbolically, a pigeon then flies into the room through the fireplace and becomes trapped in the hall. The two men eventually coax it out through a window and it flees to freedom, leaving Stevens and Darlington Hall behind.newspaper butler country house loyalty flower jew / jewish nazi britain housekeeper employer told in flashback 1950s 1930s",False,tt0107943,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,23237911,0,0,1.0206879130434785,-19.533412250327295,17310107.5,23924393.214285713,18126837.0,26126837.0,,,12875290.75,16,27875290.75,4.0,10284846.0,4.0,19618179.333333332,3.0,21768826.5,28.0,28568826.5,2.0,105206837.0,15.0,146456837.0,4.0,-2223940.0,5.0,1526060.0,2.0,-1957404.5,22.0,5642595.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,18046740.5,23546740.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,18046740.5,23546740.5,2.0,,,,-2479136.0,11520864.0,2.0,18126837.0,26126837.0,1.0,,,,,,,14838918.5,24338918.5,2.0,17966644.0,20966644.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,18126837.0,26126837.0,1.0,,,,18126837.0,26126837.0,1.0,,,,26647271.333333332,41647271.333333336,3.0,,,,18046740.5,23546740.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,38281298.18055555,24325742.625,11.25,2.8333333333333335,41299258.6989175

During this time, a family from an aristocratic background, consisting of eight-year-old Hannibal Lecter, his younger sister, Mischa, and their parents, quickly escape to the family's hunting lodge. After the Nazis take over at Lecter Castle, six Lithuanian militiamen, who want to join the Waffen-SS, are told to prove their worth. Grutas orders them to kill the Lecters' Jewish cook. They also threaten another servant of the Lecter household, asking him if he was a Gypsy or a Jew. As this happens, the Soviet Red Army begins launching attacks to retake the area. A Soviet tank crew stops at the Lecters' lodge, telling the Lecters to leave the house while they get some water. The Soviet soldiers allow Hannibal and Mischa to stay within the lodge, where it is warmer. The Soviet tank is then spotted by a German Stuka bomber, which sparks a firefight. The bomber is shot down by the tank, but subsequently crashes into it, and the ensuing explosion kills everyone still alive, except Hannibal and Mischa, who had remained inside the lodge. The Lithuanian militiamen then loot Lecter Castle as the Soviet Red Army draws nearer. The Soviet advance forces the Nazi militiamen to hide out in the woods, where they locate the Lecter lodge. Finding no other food in the bitterly cold Baltic winter, they murder and cannibalize Mischa in front of her brother, who escapes and is found by Soviet soldiers. Eight years later, Lecter once again lives in Lecter Castle, which has been turned into a Soviet-run orphanage. He has been rendered mute by his childhood trauma. Lecter escapes the castle orphanage, gets through border controls, and goes to live in Paris with his aunt, the Lady Murasaki. She gets him to speak and begins teaching him the arts of flower arrangement, martial arts, and ancestor worship. At a local market, a butcher and former Vichy collaborator, makes anti-Japanese racist remarks about Lady Murasaki. The butcher later goes fishing and is defiant when Lecter turns up to request an apology. Lecter slices the butcher's stomach, arm, and back with a katana samurai sword, and then decapitates him.  That same evening, he is questioned about the butcher's murder by Inspector Popil, a French detective who also lost his family during the war. While her protege is being interrogated, Lady Murasaki places the butcher's head outside the headquarters with a Swastika carved into his forehead. Lecter soon becomes the youngest person ever admitted to medical school in France. He receives a working scholarship, where he is given a job preparing cadavers. One day, Lecter witnesses a condemned war criminal receiving a sodium thiopental injection to force him to recall details about his crimes. In an attempt to recall the names of those responsible for his sister's death, Lecter injects himself with the solution while listening to Glenn Gould's recording of the Goldberg Variations. His subsequent flashback reveals that Pot Watcher had the dog tags of the other men who killed Mischa, and was then killed as the advancing Soviet forces bombed a part of the lodge. Lecter reasons that the dog tags should still be in the ruins of the lodge. Lecter returns to Lithuania in search of the dog tags, as well as his sister's remains. While crossing the Soviet border, he draws the attention of Dortlich, who is now a Soviet border patrol officer. Lecter excavates the ruins of the lodge and unearths the dog tags of the deserters who murdered his sister. Dortlich tries to kill him, but Lecter gets the upper hand and incapacitates him. After he buries Mischa's remains, Lecter tortures Dortlich into revealing the whereabouts of his accomplices. He then decapitates Dortlich with a horse-drawn pulley. At a restaurant in Fontainebleau, Lecter finds Kolnas's young daughter, whom he notices is wearing Mischa's bracelet. He then gives her Kolnas's dog tag. Kolnas enters the restaurant, but Lady Murasaki persuades Lecter not to kill him, for the sake of Kolnas's children. Dortlich's murder, along with Kolnas' dog tag, puts the rest of the group on alert. Grutas, now a sex trafficker, dispatches a second member of the group, Zigmas Milko, to kill Lecter. Milko sneaks into Lecter's laboratory at night with a gun, but Lecter senses his presence and knocks him out with an injection. Just as detective Popil is entering the lab, Lecter locks Milko in the cadaver tank and leaves him to drown in the embalming fluid. Popil questions Lecter about Dortlich's murder, but is again unable to establish Lecter's guilt. Popil then tries to dissuade him from hunting the gang and offers to let him go free if he helps locate Grutas. After Lecter leaves, Popil remarks to his assistant that Lecter lost all of his humanity when Mischa died. Lady Murasaki begs him to stop, but Lecter says that he made a promise to Mischa. He plants a time bomb in Grutas' home and attacks him in the bath. A maid alerts Grutas' bodyguards, but just as they are about to kill him, Lecter's bomb goes off and he escapes. Grutas kidnaps Lady Murasaki to use her as bait. Lecter recognizes the sounds of Kolnas' ortolans from his restaurant in the background. Lecter goes there and threatens Kolnas' children, forcing him to give up the location of Grutas' boat. Lecter then says he will leave Kolnas alone for the sake of his family. Kolnas goes for the gun anyway, so Lecter impales him through the head with his tantō. Lecter goes to the houseboat. Just as he is about to untie Lady Murasaki, Grutas shoots him in the back. Grutas then proceeds to molest Lady Murasaki. Lecter takes out the tantō, which was broken by the force of the bullet, and slashes Grutas' Achilles tendons with it, crippling him. Grutas claims that Lecter too had consumed his sister in broth fed to him by the deserters, and he was killing them to keep this fact secret. An enraged Lecter carves his sister's initial, M, into Grutas's chest. Lady Murasaki flees in horror. Lecter proceeds by biting off Grutas' cheeks. The houseboat is then incinerated, but Lecter, assumed to be dead, emerges from the nearby woods on the shore. Lecter hunts down the last member of the group, Grentz, in Canada. After killing him, Lecter moves to the United States to begin a new life, having been accepted to Johns Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore.winter psychopath horror serial killer",True,tt0367959,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,82169884,1,0,0.64339768,-6.117028646878049,,,,,124152865.0,180152865.0,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,157506764.5,8.0,190006764.5,2.0,-4012679.0,2.0,55987321.0,1.0,12491080.0,11.0,16491080.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31274797.0,43274797.0,1.0,,,,65708531.666666664,83041865.0,3.0,,,,,,,264692268.0,351692268.0,1.0,132647164.0,197547164.0,5.0,7153666.0,88403666.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,44278561.333333336,95945228.0,3.0,38583141.5,81083141.5,2.0,,,,-6595000.0,405000.0,1.0,,,,5350214.0,11850214.0,1.0,,,,,,,264692268.0,351692268.0,87495055.16666667,55328388.5,2.625,1.3333333333333333,105980128.20199434

When a new, younger teacher, Sheba Hart , starts at the school, Barbara feels drawn to her and believes that she ""may be the one"". Barbara discovers that Sheba is having an affair with a student, Steven Connolly ([[Andrew Simpson , and confronts her. When Sheba asks her not to tell the school administration until Christmas so that she can be with her family, Barbara explains she has no intention of telling, as long as she ends the relationship. However, Sheba does not end the affair with Steven, causing Barbara to taunt her emotionally and draw her down, leading her to end the affair with Steven. In months passing, Barbara's grasp on Sheba slowly starts to take hold, with Barbara manipulating and emotionally blackmailing her, causing her attentions to be divided between her family and Barbara. When Barbara's cat dies and Sheba's loyalties are easily divided, Sheba's husband Richard shouts in anger that her friend is being an evident pain and that his wife is being twisted by Barbara. Alone and feeling betrayed, Barbara seeks revenge by revealing Sheba's affair to a fellow teacher who comes to her asking her if Sheba is interested in him. The fellow teacher spreads the ""playground rumour"" to Steven's mother. Mrs. Connolly then comes to Sheba's home and hits Sheba. Afterwards, Sheba and her husband Richard bitterly argue. In Barbara's voice-over, she reveals she is glad that they are arguing, knowing that Sheba will come to her for comfort, which had been Barbara's plan to start with. The next day, the media, as well as the school administration, are alerted, and Sheba's affair and her life are turned upside down by the collapse of her marriage, the destroyed relationship with her children and the loss of her job. Barbara is fired from the school after denying to the headmaster that she knew of the relationship; he confronts her with a copy of a restraining order taken out against Barbara by another fellow teacher whom she had previously befriended. Sheba ends up moving into Barbara's house, believing that the affair became known because Steven confessed it to his mother, but Sheba soon finds Barbara's diary and learns that it was Barbara who leaked the story of the affair, on account of the rather sexual attraction Barbara seems to have for her. When Barbara returns from a shopping round, she is confronted by a furious Sheba, who strikes her in anger. Barbara says she has done her a favour by getting her out of a hopeless marriage. The two of them continue to shout and fight with one another, and Sheba claims that Barbara never really liked her, but in fact manipulated her for her own personal needs. Sheba runs outside with Barbara's journal, to streams of reporters and photographers. She shouts at them in a deluded fashion, but becomes hemmed in by a crush of reporters and photographers, at which point Barbara rescues her. Sheba's emotions spent, she quietly tells Barbara that she had initiated the friendship because she had liked her  and they could have been friends. Barbara says she needs more than a friend. Sheba leaves Barbara, placing the journal on the table. Sheba returns to her family home. Richard answers the door. The two face one another silently for several moments, and then Richard allows her to enter. Sheba is sentenced to 10 months, and the last scene is Barbara meeting another younger woman who is reading a newspaper reporting the Sheba Hart affair. Barbara says she used to know Sheba, but then downplays the relationship by acting as if they hardly knew each other. Barbara quickly introduces herself, and the other woman introduces herself as Annabel. The pair continue to talk. Barbara mentions attending a classical concert and invites Annabel to join her.sex adultery based on novel or book infidelity secret obsession blackmail seduction friendship stalker love loneliness teacher conservative student teenager relationship art extramarital affair journal",False,tt0465551,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,49469904,1,0,2.2979936000000003,-3.847336948521819,17230768.57142857,27630791.285714287,83520393.25,97270393.25,1161470.4285714286,9172899.0,127417074.1111111,17,162917074.1111111,9.0,-7260644.666666667,9.0,7239355.333333333,3.0,-10870330.0,10.0,7129670.0,1.0,31274797.0,3.0,43274797.0,1.0,62582859.666666664,3.0,109249526.33333333,6.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80479.0,5580479.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,80479.0,5580479.0,1.0,,,,55737889.0,77737889.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,137619070.0,165119070.0,2.0,,,,-5405232.0,18819768.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,65962084.55555555,40628751.222222224,5.25,4.0,92887866.92008553

As the grand prize raffle number called to be 919, Mr. Bean is upset and throws his raffle ticket which ends up in a toy train cart. The ticket being 616 is read upside down and becomes 919. Mr. Bean grabs the ticket before the final call and claims his prize. The prize is a holiday involving a train journey to Cannes, a Sony video camera, and €200. Bean proceeds to film the entirety of his travels on the video camera. Following a misunderstanding involving a taxi at the Gare du Nord railway station in Paris, Bean is forced to make his way on foot towards the Gare de Lyon to board his next train towards Cannes. Upon discovering the train won't leave for another hour, he has time to sample French seafood at Le Train Bleu restaurant. Unable to communicate in French, he accidentally orders oysters and langoustine, which he cannot bring himself to eat. He pours the oysters into a nearby lady's handbag, causing the lady to shriek when she was about to answer her mobile phone inside the bag, then Mr. Bean eats the whole langoustine without removing the shell. Back on the platform, Bean asks a man, who happens to be a Cannes Film Festival jury member and Russian movie critic Emil Dachevsky , to use his camcorder to film his walking onto the train. By the time they are done, the TGV is about to leave. Although Bean manages to get onto the train, the doors close before Dachevsky can get on. Dachevsky's son, Stepan  is left on board by himself. Bean attempts to befriend Stepan, who gets off at the next stop to meet his father. While confronting a threatening stranger who approaches Stepan, Bean accidentally misses the train's departure, leaving his bag aboard. The train that Stepan's father has boarded does not stop at the station, and he holds up a mobile number, but the last two digits are obscured. When their efforts at calling the number prove fruitless, they board the next train, accidentally leaving Bean's ticket and passport with 2 behind which results in the duo being forced off the train. Attempts at busking by miming to Puccini's O mio babbino caro  and other music prove successful in a shopping area. Bean buys a bus ticket to Cannes but loses his ticket when it gets caught in the breeze and then snagged in the talon of a chicken, which is subsequently loaded into a farm pick-up. Bean steals a nearby bicycle and follows the pick-up, only to reach a large chicken pen with no hope of finding the ticket. While he is on the farm, the bicycle is run over by a passing tank. After attempting to steal a moped and almost getting killed by a lorry, Bean falls to sleep in a village but wakes up to realise that he stumbled onto a set for a TV advertisement, which he accidentally blows up, injuring the director Carson Clay . Hitchhiking, Bean is picked up by actress Sabine , whom Bean encountered at the commercial filming, driving the same car as Bean. She is on her way to the 59th Cannes Film Festival where Carson Clay's film in which she makes her debut is going to be presented. When they stop at a service station, Bean finds Stepan in a café with musicians whom he met when he never got on the bus. He joins them. When Sabine falls deeply asleep on the way due to Bean accidentally activating a lullaby on her cellphone, he then drives the car himself happily, finally reaching Cannes. When Sabine goes into a petrol station to change for the premiere, news depicting Bean as Stepan's kidnapper and Sabine as an accomplice spreads. Not wanting to miss the premiere, they plan to get into Cannes without being identified. Stepan dresses up as Sabine's daughter, while Mr. Bean dresses up as Sabine's mother. They manage to get through the search and Sabine arrives at the premiere on time. After sneaking into the premiere, the trio begin to watch Clay's picture ""Playback Time,"" a shameless vanity production written by, produced by, directed by, and starring Clay himself. From the first few moments, the audience is horribly bored. Sabine tells Bean that her big scene is coming up, but is disappointed to see that her role has been cut from the film. Bean, hoping to cheer up Sabine, goes to the screening room and plugs his video camera into the projector. The ensuing scenes, heavily featuring Sabine, fit director Clay's narration so well that the director, Sabine, and Bean all receive standing ovations. Clay's initial anger fades and he embraces Bean and takes credit for the film's success, while Stepan is finally reunited with his father. After the screening, Bean leaves the building and goes to the beach, encountering many of the other characters including Sabine and Stepan. The film ends with Bean and all the other characters of the film miming a large French musical finale, lip-syncing the famous song by Charles Trenet, ""La Mer"" ([[Beyond the Sea . In a post-credits scene, Mr. Bean writes ""FIN"" on the wet sand using his toe. He films it until the camera says ""low battery"" then the sea washes the words away then the camera turns off.holiday france movie business chaos clumsy fellow to drop brick aftercreditsstinger",False,tt0453451,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,229736344,0,0,8.18945376,-6.117028646878049,168746466.5,180246466.5,91904188.42857143,114625521.76190476,71827965.10526316,108709544.05263157,144280789.0,10,168823039.0,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,62423527.4,21.0,76463527.4,5.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10576463.4,22576463.4,5.0,,,,84156603.0,114093269.66666667,18.0,233212670.0,251212670.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,121165.0,15121165.0,1.0,,,,,,,42027970.0,48027970.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,233212670.0,251212670.0,122643283.2,103352158.2,3.875,4.5,105980128.20199434

The ship is lost for reasons unknown and, seven years later, a backup spacecraft with a new payload named the Icarus II, is sent in a second and final attempt to complete the mission. After leaving the range of Earth communications, Icarus II Communications Officer Harvey  discovers the distress beacon of Icarus I while passing Mercury. Crew physicist Capa  is asked by Captain Kaneda  to calculate whether it's feasible to change course and approach Icarus I to attempt to salvage it. The stellar bomb's operation is purely theoretical and there are many things that could go wrong, so Capa recommends changing course to rendezvous with Icarus I in the hope that a second ship and payload will double the chances of success. This decision is vehemently opposed by engineer Mace ([[Chris Evans . In planning the new course, navigator Trey  forgets to realign the shields that protect the ship from the radiation and heat of the solar wind, causing damage to the spacecraft. Kaneda and Capa embark on a spacewalk to make shield repairs while the ship is angled away from the sun to shelter them. Due to another miscalculation, however, a fire is caused in the ship's oxygen garden by reflected sunlight. To control the fire the ship must be re-aligned to face the Sun as soon as possible, and Kaneda sacrifices himself repairing the panels to allow this. Trey blames himself for the loss of Kaneda and the oxygen garden, and psychiatrist Searle  assesses him as a suicide risk and sedates him. Icarus II reaches Icarus I, and the lost spacecraft is explored by Capa, Searle, Harvey, and Mace. While Icarus I has a functional oxygen garden and payload bomb, the ship's computer is found to be sabotaged, rendering delivery of the second payload impossible. Mace finds a video left by Captain Pinbacker , a radically religious man who states the mission was purposely abandoned, thinking it was the ""will of God"" that humanity should die. The crew of Icarus I is found dead in the solar observation room, having been exposed to unshielded rays of sunlight. The Icarus I and II airlocks then inexplicably decouple, damaging the Icarus I airlock and stranding the four crew members on the derelict spacecraft. Staying behind, Searle jettisons the other three using the vacuuming of the airlock to propel them into the Icarus II airlock. Harvey is knocked into space during the jump and freezes to death. Searle then enters the Icarus I observation room to die by sunlight exposure. Five remain on the Icarus II: Capa, Mace, Trey, co-pilot Cassie , and botanist Corazon . Corazon calculates that the Icarus II only has enough air for four to reach the drop-off point. Since someone must have manually decoupled the airlock as there was no hardware failure, and Trey is the only person without an alibi, everyone except Cassie decides Trey must be killed, only for the crew to find Trey has committed suicide. During a final inspection, Capa then discovers from the Icarus II computer that, even without Trey, the oxygen reserves will not last long enough due to a fifth person detected on the spacecraft. Capa ascertains that Pinbacker, now heavily burned from sun exposure, is still alive and in the observation room. Capa surmises that Pinbacker sneaked aboard, decoupled the airlocks and murdered Trey. Still believing humanity needs to die out, Pinbacker sabotages the spacecraft by removing the Icarus II’s mainframe computer from its coolant bath, shutting down the mainframe and power systems. Pinbacker, after maiming Capa and trapping him in the airlock, kills Corazon with a scalpel and chases Cassie into the payload ship, while Mace attempts to undo Pinbacker's sabotage to the mainframe. He is almost successful, managing to restore most systems before being trapped in a coolant reservoir and freezing to death. Capa, still trapped in the airlock, uses a spacesuit's welding equipment to breach the inner door, allowing him to remove the inner door by decompressing the ship. Manually decoupling the payload, Capa jumps onto the payload as its boosters fire, destroying the Icarus II. After Capa enters the payload, Pinbacker attacks and holds Capa off a precipice within the bomb, only for Cassie to grab Capa and tear the skin from Pinbacker's arm with her weight. The gravity well arresting their fall, Capa then leaves the wounded Cassie and triggers the bomb; Capa then watches as space and time distorts, allowing him to see the inner surface of the Sun break into the room as the bomb detonates. On Earth, Capa's sister reviews her brother's last message on the frozen Sydney Harbour and watches the Sun noticeably brighten, implying the mission's success.saving the world bomb sun space marine space suit sunlight solar energy space travel space mission earth expiration",False,tt0448134,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,32017803,0,0,-0.5616311962441646,-6.117028646878049,5325024.625,14210024.625,73710295.4,87710295.4,,,69891734.2,5,105591734.2,5.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,223011068.0,10.0,333011068.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-13185434.0,2.0,2814566.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,44281728.666666664,72281728.66666667,3.0,,,,146304231.57142857,199518517.2857143,7.0,122454996.2,152254996.2,5.0,64755946.0,81089279.33333333,3.0,144034190.0,284034190.0,3.0,38606727.8,46406727.8,5.0,,,,64755946.0,81089279.33333333,3.0,,,,77719885.0,82719885.0,1.0,,,,,,,29883335.0,47883335.0,2.0,,,,77719885.0,82719885.0,1.0,67593277.5,82593277.5,2.0,41187396.666666664,55520730.0,3.0,,,,57466670.0,82466670.0,1.0,,,,-8678585.5,821414.5,2.0,306404912.0,379738245.3333333,3.0,165078979.25,233578979.25,4.0,,,147139122.73333335,93239122.73333333,2.125,2.3333333333333335,105980128.20199434

Attempts by the gallery's board of directors to fire Bean are thwarted by the chairman who, for unspecified reasons, is very fond of him. Desperate to rid themselves of the turmoil Bean unintentionally causes, the board members send him to the United States to represent them at the unveiling of the portrait Whistler's Mother, which has been purchased for 50 million by the fictional Grierson Art Gallery in Los Angeles.

Unfortunely, Alison refuses David's request to allow Bean to live with them for two months, and David promises Alison that he will talk to Bean and take him to a hotel after their meeting at the gallery. Bean's unorthodox arrival at the gallery worries many of David's colleagues, particularly his boss, George Grierson , who subtly warns David that he will be responsible for Bean's actions at the unveiling of the painting, but David promises that he can handle Bean, convinced that he is merely a little eccentric. When David takes Bean back to his house, Alison departs for her mother's home, unwilling to live with Bean. With his family gone, David decides to take Bean on a tour of the Los Angeles art galleries before Whistler's Mother arrives. However, Bean decides that he and David should go to Pacific Park instead, but lands in police detainment for the second time after tampering with the controls of a motion simulator ride, making it go dangerously fast after deeming that his first ride earlier was too slow. This prompts Lieutenant Brutus , who dealt with Bean at the airport, makes David accountable for Bean and threatening to arrest Bean if he ever steps out of line again. Following a miserable dinner with Grierson which David had forgotten about, where Bean accidentally blows up the microwave after attempting to cook their Thanksgiving turkey in it, David finally realises that Bean is not a doctor and knows nothing about art. David is obliged to continue with the deception, however, as he has already staked his professional career on Bean's supposed reputation as a noted art scholar. The next day, Whistler's Mother arrives at the Grierson Art Gallery, and Bean is given a few minutes alone to study it, in an effort to keep him out of trouble. While dusting the frame, Bean accidentally sneezes on the painting and wipes it with a handkerchief, not knowing that it is covered in blue ink from a broken pen, and therefore the painting is stained. Terrified, Bean takes it to a supply room to get some agent by which to remove the ink. He uses lacquer thinner, which also dissolves the painted face from the painting. Much to his horror, Bean attempts to patch it up with an extremely unconvincing cartoon face. Upon seeing it, David is also horrified and hides the painting behind its metal security shutters. Fearing that David will lose his job and possibly face criminal proceedings for his vandalism, he and Bean head off to a bar to drown their sorrows. During the night, Bean hatches his plan to restore Whistler's Mother. Bean gathers a few items from David's house and makes his way to the Grierson Art Gallery. Bean distracts the only security guard on duty by putting laxative in his coffee, followed by switching the men's bathroom keys with some other set. He removes the destroyed painting from its frame and replaces it with a poster version of itself, glossing it with an egg and varnish mix to make it appear authentic. At the unveiling of Whistler's Mother the next day, David is overjoyed to see Bean finally restore the painting, but expects Bean, who has totally forgotten to come up with a speech, to make a fool of himself on national television when he takes the podium at the press conference. However, Bean's brief but effective off-the-cuff speech regarding the work is both very simple and very deep, cementing the public's perception of him as a scholarly virtuoso. Despite initial doubts, the officials and hierarchy appear to take his words to heart and enjoy the speech. After the unveiling, Brutus finds David and informs him that Jennifer has been involved in a motorcycle accident because she rebelled against David for not getting rid of Bean and is in intensive care. Bean and David are given a police escort to the hospital to see Jennifer, but Brutus stops on his way to deal with an armed robber, who shot Brutus in his stomach before being arrested. Due to a mix-up at the hospital, Bean is mistaken for a doctor and pushed into an operating theatre containing Brutus, who is still barely alive. While the other doctors and nurses are distracted, Bean unconventionally retrieves the bullet and eventually rescues Brutus, earning the admiration of his colleagues. Bean is again mistaken for a doctor and this time, David takes him to see Jennifer, who is unconscious. Bean, unsure what to do, attempts to use a defibrillator to bring Jennifer back to life, but accidentally shocks himself and is sent flying across the room and lands on Jennifer in her bed and waking her up in the process. Still not recognising Bean, David and Alison tells him that they will offer him anything. Bean reveals himself and later asks if he can stay with them for another week before returning to London. Though baffled, the Langleys gladly accept. After another week in Los Angeles with the Langleys, for which he gives the family gifts, and explores the city, a biker shows him his middle finger, Bean thinks it is a sign of good luck and heads to the airport to return to London. Before leaving, David tells Bean that he is welcome to come back and visit any time he likes. In his flat, Bean, getting ready to bed for the night, turns off the light and looks at the original vandalised Whistler's Mother, which now has pride-of-place on his wall, and shows it to his Teddy before closing his eyes and going to sleep.paris, france london, england california airport vault destroy museum arts and culture chaos repair clumsy fellow guard arts expert host family damage poster artwork painting farce hospital los angeles, california amusement park teenage rebellion laxative",False,tt0118689,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,251212670,0,0,12.956259444444445,-0.16960090051826512,,,98744155.6,131672955.6,37903249.25,49421749.25,,0,,,7073006.5,16.0,22073006.5,2.0,55737889.0,15.0,77737889.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,13300027.0,8.0,27100027.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1591545.0,2451545.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,248700832.0,254700832.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42303640.833333336,25370307.5,4.875,1.3333333333333333,107279251.96773516

A group of Crusaders arrive; one of them introduces himself as Balian's father, Baron Godfrey of Ibelin . Godfrey asks Balian to return with him to Jerusalem. Balian refuses and the Crusaders leave. The town priest, Balian's half-brother , reveals that he ordered Balian's wife beheaded before burial, a customary practice for people who commit suicide. Balian notices his brother wearing the cross that his wife wore before she was to be buried. In a fit of rage, Balian kills his brother, retrieves the crucifix and flees the village. Balian pursues his father in the hope of gaining forgiveness and redemption for him and his wife in Jerusalem. After he reaches Godfrey, soldiers led by Godfrey's nephew arrive, ostensibly to arrest Balian. In reality, the nephew intends to assassinate Balian and Godfrey so that his father, and eventually he, may inherit Godfrey's barony. Godfrey refuses to surrender Balian. The nephew launches a sneak attack against Godfrey. The attack fails and Godfrey kills his nephew, but is struck by an arrow that breaks off in his body. In Messina, Godfrey knights Balian and orders him to serve the King of Jerusalem and protect the helpless, before succumbing to his injuries. During Balian's journey to Jerusalem his ship runs aground in a storm, leaving Balian and a horse as the only survivors. When Balian releases the horse from the wreckage it flees in panic. Following the horse, Balian is confronted by a Muslim cavalier and his servant. A fight over the horse follows and Balian reluctantly slays the cavalier when attacked, but spares the servant, asking him to guide him to Jerusalem. Upon arriving, Balian gives the horse to the servant and releases him. The man tells him his slain master was an important knight amongst the Saracens; his deed will gain him fame and respect from them. Balian becomes acquainted with Jerusalem's political arena: the leper King Baldwin IV , Tiberias the Marshal of Jerusalem, the King's sister, Princess Sibylla , and her husband Guy de Lusignan , who supports the anti-Muslim activities of brutal factions like the Knights Templar. Guy intends to rule after Baldwin's death and seeks to provoke a war that will allow him to dispose of the Muslims and claim the Kingdom for the Christians. Guy and his co-conspirator, Raynald of Châtillon , massacre a Muslim trade caravan with the aid of the Templars. Saladin , leader of the Muslim forces, advances on Kerak, Raynald's castle, to punish him for his crime. Balian protects the villagers entering the castle from Saladin's cavalry, despite a request from Raynald to withdraw. Though outnumbered, Balian and his knights charge Saladin's cavalry, allowing the villagers time to flee. A fierce, but one-sided battle ensues in which Balian's knights are captured. In the enemy camp, Balian encounters the servant he freed, Imad ad-Din , learning he is actually Saladin's Chancellor, who releases Balian to enter Kerak. Saladin arrives with his army to besiege Kerak and King Baldwin IV approaches with his. They negotiate a Muslim retreat and Baldwin swears to punish Raynald. Baldwin confronts Raynald, forcing him onto his knees. As Raynald grovels for mercy, Baldwin slaps him a few times and forces Raynald to kiss his diseased hand. The exertion of these events causes Baldwin to collapse, weakened beyond recovery. Saladin assures his generals that he will reclaim Jerusalem, but only when he is confident of victory. Baldwin asks Balian to marry Sibylla, knowing they have affection for each other, but Balian refuses because in order for the marriage to occur Guy would have to be killed. After Baldwin dies, Sibylla succeeds her brother and names Guy King of Jerusalem. Guy releases Raynald, asking him to give him a war, which Raynald does by murdering Saladin's sister. When Saladin's emissary relays demands for the return of his sister's body, the heads of those responsible and the surrender of Jerusalem, Guy decapitates the emissary and sends his head back to Damascus. Guy sends three Templars to assassinate Balian, since he is the most strident voice against a war, though Balian survives the assassination attempt. In council, war is agreed upon ""because God wills it"" and against sound advice they march into the desert to fight Saladin, leaving Jerusalem unguarded except for Balian, Tiberias, their knights, a few remaining Crusader soldiers and the townspeople. Saladin's army attacks the Crusaders and in the ensuing battle the Crusaders are annihilated. Guy and Raynald are captured; Saladin executes Raynald and then marches on Jerusalem, sparing Guy as king only out of tradition. Tiberias and his men leave for Cyprus, believing Jerusalem is lost, but Balian and his knights remain to protect the villagers. Knowing they cannot defeat the Saracens, they hope to hold their enemies off long enough for the Saracens to offer terms. After a battle that lasts three days, Saladin offers terms: Balian surrenders Jerusalem when Saladin offers the inhabitants safe passage to Christian lands. In the marching column of citizens, he finds Sibylla who has renounced her claim as Queen of Jerusalem and other cities. After Balian returns to his village in France, English knights ride through looking for Balian, defender of Jerusalem. Balian replies that he is the blacksmith, and the man leading the knights identifies himself as King Richard I of England , and they commence a new Crusade to retake Jerusalem. Balian responds that he is merely a blacksmith, and Richard rides off. Balian is joined by Sibylla, and passing by the grave of Balian's wife, they ride toward a new life together.blacksmith crusade jerusalem epic knight swordsman order of the templars religious knight templars 12th century saladin king richard",False,tt0320661,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,211643158,0,0,0.6280242923076923,-2.6760407675788414,31681379.0,121681379.0,233440782.0,327440782.0,5858355.0,10158355.0,322409852.0,1,497409852.0,1.0,121165.0,2.0,15121165.0,1.0,43150836.666666664,19.0,72984170.0,3.0,,0.0,,,77574042.0,9.0,129907375.33333333,6.0,11735159.375,22.0,46547659.375,8.0,37222116.5,3.0,92222116.5,2.0,23535755.666666668,3.0,51869089.0,3.0,,,,95049551.2,152449551.2,5.0,,,,,,,,,,116850287.33333333,185850287.33333334,3.0,107188085.85714285,163259514.42857143,7.0,175229706.0,320229706.0,2.0,2315140.0,50315140.0,1.0,264692268.0,351692268.0,1.0,112441833.5,179441833.5,2.0,,,,,,,129047692.2,185047692.2,5.0,65512419.5,85512419.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,217815039.0,315315039.0,2.0,93337377.4,156737377.4,5.0,61505388.0,156505388.0,1.0,28976270.0,96976270.0,1.0,207215945.0,286549278.3333333,3.0,87501580.0,173001580.0,2.0,9271435.272727273,39121435.27272727,22.0,,,129437346.74404761,73678418.17261904,7.375,3.4285714285714284,109858494.28372188

With dull prospects at home, he decides to seek adventure abroad by working at a Ugandan missionary clinic run by Dr. David Merrit  and his wife, Sarah . Garrigan becomes attracted to Sarah, who enjoys the attention but refuses to engage him in an extramarital affair. Meanwhile, General Idi Amin  overthrows incumbent president Milton Obote in a coup d’état. Garrigan sincerely believes Amin will help the country, while Sarah warns him of dictators that have taken over before. Garrigan is called to a minor car accident involving Amin where he treats his hand. During the incident Garrigan takes a gun and shoots a mortally wounded cow because no one else has the presence of mind to put it out of its misery. Amin is impressed by his quick action and initiative. Amin, fond of Scotland as a symbol of resilience and admiring the Scottish people for their resistance to the English, is delighted to discover Garrigan's nationality and exchanges his military shirt for Garrigan's Scotland shirt. Later, Amin invites Garrigan to become his personal physician and take charge of modernising the country's health care system. Garrigan soon becomes Amin's trusted confidant and is relied on for much more than medical care, such as matters of state. Although Garrigan is aware of violence around Kampala, he accepts Amin's explanation that cracking down on the opposition will bring lasting peace to the country. Garrigan discovers that the polygamous leader has ostracised the youngest of his three wives, Kay , because she has given birth to an epileptic son, Mackenzie . When treating Mackenzie, Garrigan and Kay form a relationship and sleep with each other, but Kay tells him he must find a way to leave Uganda. Eventually, Garrigan begins to lose faith in Amin as he witnesses the increasing paranoia, repressive murders and xenophobia in expelling South Asians from the country. Amin replaces Garrigan's British passport with a Ugandan one to prevent him from escaping which leads Garrigan to frantically seek help from Stone , the local British Foreign Office representative. Garrigan is told the British will help him leave Uganda if he uses his position to assassinate Amin, but Garrigan refuses. Kay informs Garrigan that she has become pregnant with his child. Amin will murder her for infidelity if he discovers this, so she begs Garrigan for a secret abortion. Delayed by Amin's command that he attend a press conference with Western journalists, Garrigan fails to meet Kay at the appointed time. She concludes she has been abandoned and seeks out a primitive abortion in a nearby village, where she is apprehended by Amin's forces. Garrigan finds her savagely mutilated corpse on an autopsy table and falls retching to his knees, finally confronting the palpable inhumanity of Amin's regime and decides killing him will end it all. A hijacked aircraft is flown to Entebbe by pro-Palestinian hijackers seeking asylum from agents of international law. Amin rushes to the scene to help them, taking Garrigan along. At the airport, one of Amin's bodyguards discovers Garrigan's plot to poison Amin, under the ruse of giving him pills for a headache. His treachery revealed, Garrigan is beaten by Amin's henchmen before Amin himself arrives and discloses he is aware of the relationship with Kay. As punishment, Garrigan's chest is pierced with meat hooks and he is hanged by his skin. Amin arranges a plane for the release of non-Israeli passengers, and Garrigan's torturers leave him bleeding on the floor while they relax in another room. Garrigan's medical colleague, Dr. Junju , takes advantage of the opportunity to rescue him. He urges Garrigan to tell the world the truth about Amin's regime, asserting that because Garrigan is white the world will believe him. Junju gives Garrigan his own jacket, enabling him to mingle unnoticed with the crowd of freed hostages and board the plane. When the torturers discover Garrigan's absence, Junju is shot dead while the plane departs with Garrigan on board. Amin is informed too late to prevent it, while Garrigan tearfully remembers the people of Uganda. The epilogue shows real footage of Amin, as well as figures such as the 300,000 that died under his regime, and tells of his eventual 2003 death while in exile in Saudi Arabia.dictator africa 1970s general kidnapping naivety luxury charisma polygamy uganda dictatorship doctor idi amin fictionalized history",True,tt0455590,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,48027970,0,0,7.004661666666666,-3.847336948521819,13097901.666666666,24231261.5,,,141325825.5,163825825.5,64591324.666666664,20,70493170.66666667,3.0,193893797.33333334,2.0,269227130.6666667,3.0,,0.0,,,-4835596.0,6.0,5164404.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-74010360.0,1.0,5989640.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,110144846.875,140457346.875,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-49867.0,9950133.0,1.0,,,,15830519.25,25130519.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,87718586.33333334,44909791.5,3.625,2.0,92887866.92008553

The CIA gets word that its agent Tom Bishop  has been captured trying to free an Englishwoman, Elizabeth Hadley , from a People's Liberation Army prison in Su Chou near Shanghai. Bishop is being questioned under torture and will be executed in 24 hours unless he is claimed by the U.S. government. If the CIA claims Bishop as an agent, they risk destroying the trade agreement. Exacerbating the situation is the fact that Bishop was operating without permission from the Agency. In an attempt to quickly deal with the situation, CIA executives call in Nathan Muir , an aging mid-level case officer on his last day before retirement and the man who recruited Bishop. Although they tell Muir they simply need him to act as a ""stop gap"" to fill in some holes in their background files, the officials are hoping he gives them the smoking gun they need to justify letting Bishop die. The CIA higher-ups are not aware that Muir has already been tipped off by fellow CIA veteran Harry Duncan , for whom Bishop had been working an operation in Hong Kong before going rogue, about Bishop's capture prior to Muir's arrival at the CIA's headquarters. Muir first attempts to save Bishop by leaking the story to CNN through a contact in Hong Kong, believing that the CIA will rescue Bishop once a public outcry puts pressure on them to do so. Unfortunately, the tactic only stalls them as a phone call to the FCC from CIA Deputy Director Charles Harker  results in CNN retracting the story. During the debriefing, Muir describes how he recruited Bishop for an operation when Bishop was a U.S. Marine scout sniper during the Vietnam War. Muir also discusses their tour of duty in Berlin, Germany in 1976 where Bishop was tasked with procuring East German assets with Muir commanding, as well as Bishop's spy work in Beirut, Lebanon in 1985 during the War of the Camps, which was the last time the two saw each other. During the mission in Lebanon, Bishop met Hadley, and they began developing romantic feelings for each other. However, it is later revealed that Hadley was involved in a bombing of the Chinese embassy in the UK, causing her to flee the country. Fearing that Bishop's feelings for Hadley might compromise his cover and the mission, Muir tips off the Chinese to Hadley's location in return for freeing an arrested US diplomat. Chinese agents kidnap Hadley, and Bishop cuts all ties to Muir when he discovers his involvement. After realizing Hadley was the target of Bishop's rescue attempt, Muir finally learns that he greatly underestimated Bishop's feelings for her. Running out of time, Muir secretly creates a forged urgent operational directive from the CIA director to commence Operation Dinner Out, a rescue mission spearheaded by Commander Wiley's  U.S. Navy SEAL team, which Bishop laid the groundwork for as a ""Plan B"" to his own rescue attempt. Using US282,000 of his life savings and a misappropriated file on Chinese coastline satellite imagery, Muir enlists Duncan's help in bribing a Chinese energy official to cut power to the prison for 30 minutes, during which time the SEAL rescue team retrieves Bishop and Hadley. Bishop, who is rescued at the end of the film 15 minutes before his scheduled execution, realizes Muir was behind his rescue since the name of the plan to rescue him, ""Operation Dinner Out"", was a reference to a birthday gift that Bishop gave Muir while they were in Lebanon. When the CIA officials are informed of the rescue, Muir has already left the building and is seen driving off into the countryside.spy china cia cold war vietnam war middle east conflict flashback",False,tt0266987,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,143049560,0,0,0.2439092173913044,-0.8553948535632829,71042185.27777778,103403296.3888889,,,,,,0,,,73557872.0,1.0,83557872.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-3787450.0,3.0,4212550.0,2.0,8917292.0,5.0,13417292.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,179834564.0,224834564.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,73557872.0,83557872.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,73557872.0,83557872.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,112441833.5,179441833.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33729238.0,26229238.0,1.125,1.3333333333333333,121757219.71668534

The girls are both social outcasts, but Rebecca is more popular with boys than Enid. Enid's diploma is awarded on the condition that she attend a remedial art class. Even though she is a talented artist, her art teacher, Roberta , believes art must be socially meaningful and dismisses Enid's sketches as ""light entertainment"". Shortly after graduation, the two girls see a personal ad in which a lonely man named Seymour  asks a woman he met recently to contact him. With Becky at her side, Enid makes a prank phone call to Seymour, pretending to be the woman and inviting him to meet her at a diner, and when he goes there, the two girls secretly watch and make fun of him. However, Enid begins to feel sorry for him, so a few days later they follow him to his apartment building, where they find him selling vintage records in a garage sale. Enid buys an old blues album from him, and they gradually become friends. One of her favorite activities is trying to find women for him to date. Meanwhile, Enid has been attending her art class. In order to please Roberta, Enid persuades Seymour to lend her an old poster depicting a grotesquely caricatured black man, which was once used as a promotional tool by the fried-chicken franchise where Seymour holds a middle management position. In class, she presents the poster as a social comment about racism, and Roberta is so impressed with the concept that she later offers Enid a scholarship to an art college. At this point, Enid's and Becky's lives have seriously diverged. While Enid has been spending time with Seymour, Becky has found a job and become more interested in clothing, boys, and other material things. Enid finds a job so the girls can rent an apartment together, but she is fired after only one day. Finally, Becky gives up on looking for an apartment with Enid after their personal differences erupt in an angry argument. Sometime after Enid loses her job, Seymour receives a phone call from Dana , the woman he had written to in the personal ad. Enid encourages him to develop a relationship with Dana, but becomes jealous when he begins avoiding Enid to spend time with Dana. At the end of the summer, Enid's and Seymour's lives fall apart. When Enid's poster is displayed in an art show, school officials find it so offensive they force Roberta to give her a failing grade; when Enid discovers she has lost her scholarship, she visits Seymour for solace, resulting in a drunken one-night stand. Seymour then breaks up with Dana before realizing he has no chance with Enid, and loses his job after the poster is displayed in a newspaper. Becky tells Seymour about Enid's phone prank, and he becomes hospitalized after attacking a boy who was with the girls at the time. Finally, Enid gives in to her childhood fantasy of running away from home. Throughout the film, she has periodically spoken with an old man named Norman  who was waiting at an unused bus stop for a bus that never arrived. After quitting her new job and meeting with Seymour in the hospital, Enid sees a bus finally arrive to pick up Norman, and the next day, while Seymour discusses the summer's events with his therapist, Enid goes to the bus stop and gets on the bus when it arrives. The film ends as the bus drives away.based on comic high school friends social outcast art class record collector plaster personal ad blues music nunchaku prank telephone call aftercreditsstinger",False,tt0162346,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,8761608,0,0,0.5930196363636364,-0.8553948535632829,,,,,-4835596.0,5164404.0,,0,,,,0.0,,,27318494.0,10.0,37651827.333333336,3.0,,0.0,,,1284514.0,6.0,21284514.0,1.0,,0.0,,,4228953.0,11.0,5728953.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-4835596.0,5164404.0,1.0,,,,147968902.0,182968902.0,1.0,,,,43556623.333333336,59556623.333333336,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21555098.111111112,10943987.0,3.375,1.6666666666666667,121757219.71668534

They hear a terrified boy, who is running away from the infected, pounding at their door. They let him in and give him some food to eat. He explains that his own parents tried to kill him. Another survivor named Karen checks outside through a peephole, but one of the infected attacks her and bites her on the arm. Survivor Jacob tries to save her, but Karen attacks him as well. Alice takes the boy upstairs, Jacob and an elderly couple hide in the barn, and Don defends them and kills a few of the infected with a crowbar. In the barn, the couple is attacked, and Jacob tries to save a woman named Sally, to no avail. He locks himself in the attic and finds his way outside. Alice and the boy lock themselves in the room, but the infected find and attack them. Don finds them, but escapes through the window, leaving them to be attacked by the infected. He runs through fields, as a horde of infected pursue him. He finds Jacob near a motorboat; Don starts it, but Jacob falls down and is infected as Don escapes. After five weeks, all the infected have died of starvation. After eleven weeks, NATO forces headed by the US take control of Great Britain. After eighteen weeks the island is declared relatively safe, although still under quarantine. Twenty-eight weeks after the outbreak, an American-led force, under the command of Brigadier General Stone, bring in settlers to re-populate the area. Among the new arrivals are Tammy and Andy, Don and Alice's children, who were in Spain on a school trip during the initial outbreak. They are subsequently admitted to District One, a safe zone guarded by the US Army, on the Isle of Dogs. As they are examined by Major Scarlet Levy, the district's chief medical officer, she notes Andy's differently coloured eyes, a trait inherited from his mother. Sergeant Doyle, a Delta sniper and his friend, helicopter pilot Chief Flynn, are amongst the military presence charged with guarding the district. The children are reunited with their father, who had survived the original infection and was found by the US army, and who has become the district's senior maintenance engineer. In their new flat, Don explains what happened and that after he escaped, he arrived in a military camp and waited with the soldiers through the weeks. The next day, Tammy and Andy, mournful over the loss of their mother, leave the safe zone and proceed to the depopulated London wasteland area to their former house on a scooter, hoping to retrieve and take their old belongings with them. To their shock, they find their mother in a semi-conscious state. Doyle had seen the two children leave the safe zone; they and their mother are subsequently picked up by soldiers and returned to the district. Tammy and Andy are taken back to their living quarters while Alice is taken to a biohazard room where she is tested and found to be an asymptomatic carrier of the Rage Virus, with the virus inside her but with no symptoms. Later that day, Don sneaks through the security and makes an unauthorized visit to Alice in her isolation cell and asks forgiveness for abandoning her at the cottage. When they kiss, however, the Rage Virus in her saliva immediately infects Don, who savagely kills her before going on a rampage, killing and infecting several soldiers in the building. General Stone orders the building to be quarantined and District One to be put into Code Red Lock-down, and civilians are herded into safe rooms. Despite the precautions, Don breaks into a room containing a large crowd and begins killing and infecting them, quickly causing a domino effect of attackers. Scarlet rescues Tammy and Andy from containment as the soldiers in District One are ordered to shoot indiscriminately. Doyle, unable to bring himself to comply with the order, abandons his post and escapes with Scarlet, the children and others through the Greenwich foot tunnel. General Stone then orders that District One be firebombed, but large numbers of the infected, including Don, escape the bombardment. Scarlet informs Doyle that the children may hold the key to a cure and must be protected at all costs. Flynn arrives by helicopter to pick up Doyle, but refuses to take anyone else as they would be shot down if carrying possibly infected people. Flynn contacts Doyle by radio and tells him to head to Wembley Stadium, but to leave the civilians. Doyle ignores his instructions and begins escorting the civilians to Wembley, breaking into an abandoned car to escape nerve gas released to kill the infected. He is burned alive by soldiers as he tries to push start the car. Scarlet drives the car away, but a military chopper tries to blow them up; she manages to escape the chopper with the kids. She drives them into the London Underground where, as the trio continue on foot, she is ambushed and killed by Don who then attacks and bites Andy. Tammy shoots Don before he can kill Andy who remains symptom-free, but with darker, bloodier eyes, like his mother. The children continue to the Stadium and are picked up by a reluctant Flynn, who flies them across the English Channel to France, as previously instructed by Doyle. 28 days after the events, a French-accented voice requesting help is heard from the radio in Flynn's abandoned helicopter. A group of infected are seen running through a tunnel which, as they emerge into the open, is revealed to be the exit of the Paris Métro Trocadéro station with a view of the nearby Eiffel Tower, meaning that the infection spread around Europe.london, england sibling relationship loss of loved one mutant pest dying and death chaos survivor supernatural survival on the run zombie danger escapade virus plague female corpse deadly chases and races chaos and mayham",False,tt0463854,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,64238440,0,0,3.2825626666666667,-6.117028646878049,58428213.333333336,78428213.33333333,58273976.5,80273976.5,,,,0,,,122846831.0,11.0,171930164.33333334,6.0,-17982197.0,0.0,32017803.0,1.0,102103.0,3.0,176153.0,1.0,,0.0,,,1076502.0,9.0,38326502.0,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-17982197.0,32017803.0,1.0,,,,28715747.25,62215747.25,4.0,,,,,,,99048797.33333333,132215464.0,6.0,,,,,,,34469904.0,49469904.0,1.0,,,,44071410.25,68821410.25,4.0,,,,29868844.0,57368844.0,2.0,15612137.0,29612137.0,1.0,,,,,,,-17982197.0,32017803.0,1.0,,,,39068119.333333336,65734786.0,3.0,26394998.25,49644998.25,4.0,-17982197.0,32017803.0,1.0,19742236.5,57242236.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,77719885.0,82719885.0,60612655.583333336,26510809.75,2.875,3.0,105980128.20199434

Taking others into protective custody, the FBI asks NYPD detective John McClane  to collect Matthew ""Matt"" Farrell . McClane arrives in time to prevent Farrell from being killed by an assassin, Mai Linh , working for Thomas Gabriel . En route to Washington, D.C. Farrell explains he had written a portion of security code for a large sum of money from Mai. As they arrive in D.C., Gabriel orders his own crew of hackers to take control of the transportation grids and stock market, while nationally broadcasting a message threatening the United States. Farrell recognizes this as the start of a ""fire sale"", an attack designed to target the nation's reliance on computer controls, such that ""everything must go"". McClane and Farrell are taken by police escorts to the secured FBI headquarters, but Mai, using the hijacked grids, reroutes the convoy into the path of an assault helicopter. McClane is able to take down the helicopter by launching a police car over a damaged toll booth into it. As McClane and Farrell recover, Gabriel initiates a second broadcast, showing a simulated explosion of the U.S. Capitol building, sending the public into panic. Farrell recognizes that the next target of the ""fire sale"" is likely the power grid, and the two drive to a utility superstation in West Virginia. They find a team led by Mai breaking into the station's controls. McClane is able to kill the entire team, including Mai, and obtain video footage of Gabriel, which they relay to FBI headquarters. Enraged over Mai's death, Gabriel uses remote control of the station to redirect the natural gas supply into it. McClane and Farrell escape before the station explodes, leaving much of the eastern seaboard without power. Farrell directs McClane to a fellow hacker, Frederick ""Warlock"" Kaludis , in Baltimore. Warlock, running his computer systems from several generators, identifies the piece of code Farrell wrote as a means to access data at a Social Security Administration building at Woodlawn, Maryland. They realize this building is a front for a National Security Agency facility, designed by Gabriel to download all personal and financial records in case of a cyber-security emergency such as this one generated by Gabriel himself. Warlock is also able to explain Gabriel's motivation: a talented hacker, he was once a top expert for the U.S. Defense Department. However, Gabriel was fired and his reputation was tarnished when he tried to sound the alarm about America's vulnerability to cyber-warfare. Gabriel detects Warlock's hack and speaks with him, Farrell, and McClane, and reveals that he has kidnapped McClane's estranged daughter, Lucy . McClane and Farrell race to the Woodlawn facility. As McClane deals with Gabriel's men, Farrell discovers that Gabriel is downloading all the information onto a portable computer system, and he is able to encrypt the data after it is completed. Gabriel is forced to take Farrell as they escape the facility. McClane follows, hijacking Gabriel's semi and gains Warlock's help to trace Gabriel's own vehicle. With McClane in pursuit, Gabriel hacks into the military's computers to deceive a U.S. Marine F-35B Lightning II pilot into believing that McClane is a terrorist. McClane is able to escape the assault when pieces from the damaged truck fall into the jet intake of the aircraft from a highway exit ramp. McClane makes his way to a nearby warehouse to which Warlock tracked Gabriel. Though McClane dispatches most of Gabriel's men, Gabriel's last henchman, Emerson, wounds him in the shoulder.

The team is slaughtered by zombies. Lickers and the undead escape into the outside world. Umbrella establishes a security perimeter around Raccoon City. However, a little girl goes missing after the Umbrella car transporting her crashes. After surviving the Hive, Alice was recovered by Umbrella and experimented on. She now has superhuman strength, speed and agility. Waking up in an empty hospital, she wanders outside to find the city is a ghost town. She arms herself with a shotgun from a police car and starts walking. She is disturbed by a man who keeps showing up in visions, who was experimenting on her. While Umbrella is evacuating civilians at the last open bridge, police officer Jill Valentine  confers with Sergeant Peyton Wells . However, the T-virus infects a man having a heart attack, turning him into a zombie that bites Peyton. Umbrella supervisor Timothy Cain  seals the exit and orders his soldiers to fire over the crowd's heads, scaring them back into the city. Elsewhere, Carlos Olivera  and other Umbrella soldiers link up with Special Tactics And Rescue Squad  units to defend against an onslaught of zombies in the city. Their positions are overrun, causing Carlos and his team to retreat with a bitten Yuri , who turns into a zombie and infects Carlos before being killed. Jill, Peyton and a news reporter named Terri Morales  lock themselves in a church, which turns out to be full of Lickers; they are saved at the last minute by the heavily armed Alice. Umbrella dispatches their Nemesis program to kill all remaining STARS operatives, and plan to sanitize Raccoon City using a nuclear weapon. When Nemesis encounters a surviving citizen, L.J.  and members of STARS, they open fire. He guns the STARS down but spares L.J.'s life when he drops his weapons. Dr. Charles Ashford , an Umbrella scientist and creator of the T-virus, has refused extraction until he has located and rescued his daughter Angela , and soon figures out she is hiding out in her school dormitory after the car crash. He contacts Alice and the other survivors, and offers to arrange their evacuation in exchange for rescuing Angela. Alice is separated from the group when Nemesis appears and kills the zombified Peyton. Jill and Terri make it to the school, picking up L.J. on the way, and they encounter Carlos and Nicholai , acting on the same offer. After encounters with zombie dogs and infected children who kill Nicholai and Terri, Alice saves the group again and they find Angela. Angela reveals she was injected with the T-virus; Dr. Ashford created the T-virus to allow her to walk, but he also created the anti-virus because of the T-virus's potential for mutations. Alice reveals she was injected as well, but is not suffering mutations. She injects Carlos with the anti-virus to save him. Dr. Ashford gives Alice the location of the extraction point at City Hall, where the helicopter waits. The group makes it to the rendezvous, but are cornered by Major Cain, who has caught wind of Dr. Ashford's intentions and is holding him prisoner. All but Alice are restrained, and seconds later Nemesis appears. Major Cain commands Alice to fight Nemesis. Alice refuses, until Dr. Ashford is shot and killed. She relents and fights him, impaling him on a pole. Defeating Nemesis, she realizes he is Matt Addison. Her stand rekindles a trace of Nemesis's former humanity and they join forces and attack the Umbrella forces. Nemesis is killed, protecting Alice. She is hit with a propeller from a blown up helicopter and knocked out. Angela and Carlos go to her. Carlos helps her to a helicopter and they escape in it. Alice throws Major Cain out of the helicopter. He shoots a few infected people, but ultimately is overcome. The nuclear missile detonates over the center of Raccoon City, destroying it completely. The helicopter is caught in the blast wave and crashes. As the helicopter falls, a metal pole comes loose and is flung towards Angela. Alice moves in front of Angela and is impaled, saving her. Some hours after the explosion, Umbrella employees locate the helicopter's crash site, deep in the Arklay Mountains. There, they find Alice's body, badly burned. The others are nowhere to be found. Umbrella employees take her body. The media shows that Terri's footage has been shown to the press, saying that Umbrella released the zombies and the T-virus. Umbrella denies this, arguing that it is a hoax. Umbrella promotes a fake story about a nuclear power plant explosion near the city. The media announce that Jill and Carlos are wanted by the police for questioning. Three weeks later, in the midwest Umbrella research facility, Alice awakens. Led by Umbrella scientist Dr. Isaacs , the doctors begin questioning her. Soon she recalls events from Raccoon City and before. She realizes that the doctor who appeared in her visions is Dr. Isaacs. She attacks him, and fights her way out of the facility. She makes her way outside only to be surrounded by more Umbrella guards holding her at gunpoint. Suddenly, Jill, Carlos, Angela, and L.J. pull up, disguised as Umbrella employees. Carlos shows the guards a written order placing her in his custody. Alice enters the vehicle, and as they drive away, Angela asks her if she is all right. She doesn't respond, and Dr. Isaacs is shown saying, ""Let them go,"" and then ""Program Alice activated."" A close-up of her eye shows a flashing Umbrella logo. The scene then pulls away from the car they are in and all the way out into space, where an Umbrella satellite is seen.martial arts mutant dystopia rescue conspiracy evil corporation zombie based on video game",False,tt0318627,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,129394835,0,0,1.8754407777777773,1.9257596443831189,51962459.0,70712459.0,,,,,29180248.5,4,52180248.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,85072577.0,2.0,120072577.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,3000000.0,1.0,10000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-37821105.0,72178895.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,69984862.0,102984862.0,1.0,69984862.0,102984862.0,1.0,,,,-9401355.0,598645.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,85584362.5,137084362.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-21097985.0,18902015.0,1.0,,,,38332849.0,59832849.0,2.0,69984862.0,102984862.0,60750941.833333336,39084275.166666664,0.875,1.3333333333333333,84824632.31357588

Amanda Woods  is a workaholic who owns a company that produces movie trailers in Los Angeles. Iris Simpkins  is a society column editor for The Daily Telegraph in London. Iris has been in love with Jasper Bloom  for over three years, despite his unfaithful tendencies. When she finds out that he is engaged to the ""other woman,"" Iris begins despairing over the state of affairs in her life. Meanwhile, Amanda discovers that her live-in boyfriend Ethan Ebbers  has cheated on her with his 24-year-old secretary. She decides she wants to get away for the holidays. She visits a home swap website on which Iris had previously listed her ""quaint cottage in Surrey.” Amanda messages Iris about her interest. Iris quickly agrees and the two agree to swap homes for two weeks. Iris revels in the luxury of Amanda's Los Angeles home, while Amanda is disappointed by the slower, quieter pace of life in Surrey. Amanda grows bored after just a few hours of trying to find something to do, and books a flight back to LA for the next day. Later that night, Iris’ brother Graham  knocks at the door assuming Iris is home. Graham asks Amanda to let him spend the night despite the fact that he is a stranger, as he has been drinking at the pub and doesn't want to drive. They end up sleeping together. In the morning Graham receives a number of phone calls from Sophie and Olivia which rouses the suspicions of Amanda that Graham is a womanizer. Graham, knowing that Amanda is leaving to return home, says to Amanda ""that if the flight gets cancelled, he is having dinner at the pub with friends. At the airport, just as Amanda's tickets are being processed, she decides to stay and goes to the pub. Graham enters the pub, looks for her but cannot see her until he meets his friends and then sees Amanda. Amanda drinks far too much that night. Graham suggests they go to lunch to get to know one another better. During lunch, Amanda shares with Graham, that her parents divorced when she was fifteen and since then she has been unable to cry. Graham responds that he cries all the time: Movies, books, sad stories etc,. While obviously enjoying each others' company, Amanda is worried that the relationship will become ""complicated,"" and tries to keep Graham at arm's length. Meanwhile in LA, Iris is enjoying the stay at Amanda's house. She meets Ethan's friend Miles  when he comes with his girlfriend Maggie  to Amanda's house. Later, she finds an old man, Arthur Abbott  standing lost at the corner, and escorts him home. She learns that he was a script writer during the Golden Age of Hollywood. The two become fast friends. Arthur notes that Iris' behavior toward Jasper does not match her strong personality, and he suggests movies for her to watch that include strong female characters, in hopes that she can acquire what he calls ""gumption."" Iris finds out that the Screenwriters' Guild wants to throw a grand celebration in Arthur's honor, but he is reluctant to go for several reasons, chief among them being that he cannot walk without the assistance of his walker, and does not want to embarrass himself. Iris encourages him to go because it's a real honor, and promises to help him prepare to attend the award function with her. She undertakes an exercise program with him, determined to help him walk without his walker. During these days Jasper contacts her several times to get her to help with the book he is writing. She agrees to look over his pages, but ends up being so busy that she doesn't have time. Amanda chooses not to see Graham again but once alone in the house she has a change of heart and surprises Graham at his house. He looks extremely nervous at the door, looking over his shoulder inside the house. Amanda asks Graham whether he is alone, and he says he isn't. However, before she can turn away, Olivia and Sophie come to the door, revealing that they are in fact Graham's daughters. Amanda is shocked and asks Graham in a whisper if he is divorced. He says no, because his wife died two years ago. Amanda asks him why he did not reveal the existence of his daughters to her during their sharing at lunch. Graham reveals that he doesn't usually tell women about them because he doesn't know how to date and be a dad. Amanda fits in beautifully, making Graham reconsider his decision to keep their relationship strictly casual. Iris and Miles have slowly become friends, and one night go to the video store to rent some movies that Arthur had recommended. From the video store Miles sees his girlfriend Maggie in the arms of another guy. He is shocked, as she told him that she would be in Santa Fe on an extended film shoot and would not be in L.A. for this Christmas Eve. He runs out of the store to find out the truth and realizes that she has betrayed him. Both return to Amanda's house, where they discuss their tendencies to fall for people that they know are wrong for them, and grow closer for it. Since they are now both single, they allow their natural chemistry to flow a little more, and they grow closer and hang out more often. But one day while Miles & Iris are eating lunch together, Maggie calls Miles and wants to see him. Miles leaves to see her, but promises to come to Arthur’s award ceremony that night. Iris goes back to Amanda's where she is shocked to find Jasper. Iris is touched at first, but then asks if he is still engaged. When he responds that he is, she finally breaks up with him for good. Meanwhile Maggie tries in vain to convince Miles to forgive her. He realizes that Maggie was never meant for him and he can never trust her anymore. He breaks up with her and rushes to attend Arthur’s award ceremony. Iris and Arthur arrive at the ceremony and is very surprised to find the hall filled with people all standing and applauding for his achievements. That, plus the song that Miles wrote especially for Arthur for this moment, gives him the confidence to walk onto the stage unassisted. Miles arrives and asks Iris for a date on New Year's Eve. Iris responds that she will be back in London by then, however, Miles says ""I have never been to London."" Iris responds she would love to spend the evening with Miles. Meanwhile, Graham confesses his love for Amanda on the night before she is scheduled to depart for L.A. But Amanda despairs that if she stays in L.A. and he in London, the long distance relationship will never work. She insists that this be the end, but on her way to the airport, she cries for the first time since she was fifteen years of age. She realises that her feelings for Graham are more powerful than her fears and returns to the house to find Graham crying. Amanda tells him that she has decided to stay until New Year's Eve with him, and they hug knowing that this is just the beginning. The movie ends in Graham’s place. Iris with Miles and Amanda with Graham and his daughters enjoying the New Year laughing and dancing.holiday london, england movie business christmas party country house room exchange surrey romantic comedy los angeles, california multiple storylines woman director christmas",False,tt0457939,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,194168700,1,0,1.2843376470588237,-3.847336948521819,,,35584571.22727273,55952753.04545455,71760465.85714285,108546180.14285715,25575120.625,11,61075120.625,8.0,,0.0,,,14773213.8,7.0,73173213.8,5.0,17126295.0,6.0,47126295.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-74010360.0,1.0,5989640.0,1.0,-6935165.0,10.0,17564835.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,,,163232085.5,264732085.5,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,82944923.0,162944923.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,44244700.0,50244700.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,40985820.885,-4694179.115,4.375,3.4,92887866.92008553

His ex-wife  believes that he is a bad example to their eleven year-old son Nick , and Larry fears that Nick respects his future stepfather, bond trader Don , more than him. Cecil , an elderly night security guard about to retire from the American Museum of Natural History, hires Larry despite his unpromising résumé. Because of recent financial troubles, the museum plans to replace Cecil and his two colleagues Gus  and Reginald  with one guard. They advise Larry to leave some of the lights on and warn him not to let anything ""in...or out"". Once night comes, Larry discovers that the exhibits come to life, including a living Tyrannosaurus skeleton nicknamed ""Rexy"" who behaves like a dog ; a mischievous capuchin monkey named Dexter , which always steals Larry's keys ; rival miniature civilizations led by Old West cowboy Jedediah  and Roman general Octavius ; an Easter Island Moai , who calls Larry dum-dum and loves gum-gum; and wax models of the likes of Theodore Roosevelt , and Attila the Hun ([[Patrick_Gallagher_, who makes a habit of chasing Larry wildly through the museum with his Huns. Roosevelt explains that since an Egyptian artifact&mdash;the Golden Tablet of Pharaoh Akhmenrah&mdash;came to the museum in 1952, all of the exhibits come to life each night. If the exhibits are outside of the museum during sunrise, however, they turn to dust. Roosevelt helps Larry by restoring order, and he decides to remain as a guard. On Cecil's advice, Larry studies history to prepare himself better. He also learns from a museum docent, Rebecca Hutman , who is writing a dissertation on Sacagawea  but does not feel she knows enough about her subject. The next night, Larry uses what he has learned to better control the exhibits (helping solve the Neanderthals' quest for fire by tossing them a cigarette lighter; giving the Easter Island head a wad of chewing gum . However, things go awry when his attempt at winning over Atilla with cheap magic tricks fails, the dioramas continue fighting despite their agreement with Larry and Dexter is able to steal Larry's keys again and let out all of the animal exhibits. The Neanderthals then set fire to a display and one turns to dust when he leaves the museum at dawn , so museum director Dr. McPhee  almost fires Larry. He offers Rebecca a meeting with Sacagawea, but she believes that he is mocking her and the museum, and leaves him. Larry brings Nick to the museum to show him the exhibits, but none is alive. They investigate and catch Cecil, Gus, and Reginald in the act of stealing the tablet and other valuable objects. Like the exhibits, the guards receive enhanced vitality from the artifact; wishing to retain their health and fund their retirements, the three plan to frame Larry for the thefts, and disabled the tablet to stop the exhibits from interfering. Nick reactivates the tablet, but Cecil locks him and his father in the Egyptian room and flees with the tablet. Larry releases the Akhmenrah's  mummy from his sarcophagus. The pharaoh speaks English from many years as an exhibit at Cambridge, and helps Larry and Nick escape. The three find the other exhibits fighting all over the lobby, and Larry convinces them to work together. Although some of the exhibits capture Gus and Reginald without difficulty, Cecil escapes by stagecoach with Larry, Nick, Akmenrah, Jedediah, Octavius, and Atilla the Hun in pursuit in Central Park, where they stop him and regain the tablet.

Among them are Major John Reisman , an OSS officer; his commander, Regular Army Major General Worden , and his former commander Colonel Everett Dasher Breed . Early in the film the personalities of the three men are shown to clash and the characters of the individualistic Reisman and the domineering Breed are established. Reisman is aided by his friend, the mild mannered Major Max Armbruster  Major Reisman is assigned an unusual and top-secret pre-invasion mission: take a small unit of soldiers convicted of felonies and turn them into a commando squad to be sent on a special mission. The mission is an airborne infiltration and assault on a chateau near Rennes in Brittany. The chateau will be hosting a meeting of dozens of high ranking German officers, the elimination of which will presumably hamper the German military's ability to respond to D-Day. Those felons who survive the mission will have their sentences commuted. It quickly becomes clear that both Reisman and his superiors regard the operation as a near suicide mission and expect that few, if any of the felons will return. Reisman is assigned twelve convicts, all either serving lengthy sentences or destined to be executed. Notable members include slow witted Vernon Pinkley ; Robert Jefferson , an African American soldier convicted of killing a man in a racial brawl; Samson Posey  a gentle giant who becomes enraged when pushed; Joseph Wladislaw  a taciturn coal miner convicted of shooting his squad's medic who was recruited for his ability to speak German; A.J. Maggott , a misogynist and religious fanatic; and Victor Franko , a former member of the Chicago organized-crime Syndicate who has extreme problems with authority. Under the supervision of Reisman and military police Sergeant Bowren , the group begin training. After being forced to construct their own living quarters, the twelve individuals are trained in combat by Reisman and gradually learn how to operate as a group. For parachute training they are sent to the base operated by Colonel Breed. Under strict orders to keep their mission secret, Reisman's men run afoul of Breed and his troops, especially when Pinkley poses as a general and inspects Breed's troops. Angered at the usurpation of his authority, Breed attempts to discover Reisman's mission and then attempts to get the program shut down. Major Armbruster suggests a test of whether Reisman's men are ready: during practice maneuvers which Breed will be taking part in, the ""Dirty Dozen"" will attempt to capture the Colonel's headquarters. During the maneuvers, the men use various unorthodox tactics, including theft, impersonation, and rule breaking, to infiltrate Breed's headquarters and hold him and his men at gunpoint. This proves to the General that Reisman's men are ready. The night of the raid, the men are flown to France, and practise a rhyme they have learned which details their roles in the operation. There is a slight snag when one of the Dozen, Jiminez  breaks his neck and dies upon landing in a tree, but the others proceed with the mission. Wladislaw and Reisman infiltrate the meeting disguised as German officers while Franko and Maggott sneak onto the top floor of the building. The others set up in various locations around the chateau. The plan falls apart when Maggott sees one of the women who had accompanied the officers, abducts her at knifepoint, and orders her to scream. However the officers downstairs ignore her, thinking she is having sex. Maggott then stabs her and begins shooting, alerting the officers. As the officers and their companions retreat to an underground bomb shelter, a general firefight ensues between the Dozen and the German troops. After Wladislaw and Reisman lock the Germans in the bomb shelter, the Dozen pry open the ventilation ducts to the shelter and drop unprimed grenades down, then pour gasoline inside. Jefferson throws a primed grenade down each shaft and sprints for their vehicle, but is shot down as the grenades explode. Reisman, Bowren, Wladislaw, and Franko, the last remaining survivors of the assault team, are making their escape on a German half-track when Franko, shouting triumphantly that he has survived, is shot by a stray round. Back in England only Reisman, Bowren and Wladislaw have managed to get out alive. The film unfolds in three major acts.  After witnessing a hanging in a military jail in London, Major Reisman is briefed on the mission at General Worden's headquarters. As the credits to the film are rolling he walks along the line of 12 prisoners and stares at each of them as Sergeant Bowren  reads out their sentences. {| class""col"" width""col"" width""col"" widthAct two - TrainingAct three - The mission The final act, which was a mere footnote in the novel, is an action sequence detailing the attack on the chateau.

Captain Antonio Corelli, a Greek-speaking officer of the infantry division 'Acqui' with an irrepressibly jovial personality and a passion for the mandolin, and who trains his battery of men - who have never fired a shot - in choral singing, initially alienates a number of the villagers, including Pelagia. The daughter of the village doctor, Pelagia is an educated and strong-willed woman, and while at first offended by the Italian soldier's behaviour, she slowly warms to his certain charm as they are forced to share her father's home when the doctor agrees to put him up in exchange for medical supplies. When Pelagia's fiance, Mandras, a local fisherman, heads off to war on the mainland, the friendship between Antonio and Pelagia grows. Her beauty and intelligence have captured his heart and his fondness for the village's vibrant community causes him to question his reasons for fighting. Antonio and his battery of musical troops become part of the lives of the villagers, but the moment is fleeting. As the war grows closer, Antonio and Pelagia are forced to choose between their allegiances and the love they feel for one another - a love which must overcome tremendous odds, and endure the inevitable sacrifice which accompanies devotion. The Italian government surrenders to the Allies, and the Italian troops happily prepare to go home. However, their erstwhile allies the Germans insist on disarming the Italians, intemperately and violently. The Greeks are exposed to the brutal incoming Germans, and arrange with the Italians to use their arms in a brief and futile resistance. For this, the German High Command has thousands of the Italian troops shot as traitors. Corelli survives when one of his soldiers throws himself across him, and Mandras takes him to Pelagia and the doctor to recover, and then to a boat to escape the island. Pelagia discovers that Mandras did not reply to her letters because he is illiterate, and they part. In 1947, Pelagia receives a parcel from Italy containing a record of the tune Corelli wrote for her, but no note. An earthquake destroys much of the village and the doctor's house, but island life continues, and eventually Corelli returns to Pelagia.officer allies greek island mandolin italian soldier resistance fighter greek history italian army",False,tt0238112,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,62112895,1,0,0.08969991228070176,-0.8553948535632829,74920378.8235294,105832143.52941176,87781760.5,107452314.3,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,29140668.8,35.0,38920668.8,5.0,-4686356.0,3.0,4313644.0,1.0,22900000.0,40.0,28900000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,120719644.33333333,135219644.33333334,3.0,,,,,,,179834564.0,224834564.0,1.0,,,,264317794.0,289317794.0,1.0,,,,83411775.8,99211775.8,5.0,,,,127215076.25,145680076.25,4.0,,,,9358920.0,24788920.0,2.0,-10870330.0,7129670.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10673268.333333334,21575114.333333332,3.0,,,,5475818.5,13475818.5,2.0,,,,-9070394.0,929606.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,24044770.933333334,15784770.933333334,9.75,2.3333333333333335,121757219.71668534

The film flashes back to the end of the Easter Rising in 1916, as Collins , Harry Boland , Éamon de Valera , and other survivors surrender to the British Army. As the Dublin Metropolitan Police's ""G"" Division identifies the leaders, Collins tells Boland that next time, ""We won't play by their rules, Harry. We'll invent our own."" All the other leaders die by firing squad, but de Valera, an American citizen, is imprisoned in Britain. Collins, Boland, and the others are sent to Frongoch internment camp. After his release, Collins runs for a seat in the First Dáil. While giving a speech, the rally is attacked by the Royal Irish Constabulary. Collins is severely beaten, but is rescued by Boland. While recovering on a friend's farm, they meet Kitty, who begins a romance with Boland. Collins is tipped off by Detective Ned Broy  that the British plan to arrest de Valera and his Cabinet. However, de Valera forbids anyone to go into hiding, stating that the ensuing public outcry will force their immediate release. Only Collins and Boland escape arrest and imprisonment, and there are no protests. Left in command, Collins orders the IRA to begin raiding police barracks for weapons. He also issues a statement that all collaboration with the British will be punished by death. Collins then recruits a squad from the IRA's Dublin Brigade, which, on Bloody Sunday, assassinates fourteen members of MI5's Cairo Gang. In retaliation, the Black and Tans fire into the crowd at a Gaelic football match at Croke Park. Broy is caught burning documents and killed. Later, Boland and Collins travel to Britain and break de Valera out of Lincoln prison. Angry that Collins has overshadowed him, de Valera announces that he will travel to the United States to seek recognition from Woodrow Wilson, and orders Boland to accompany him. Before they depart, Collins informs Boland that de Valera fears leaving them alone together. After returning, de Valera decrees that the IRA must attack The Custom House. Collins argues that fighting conventionally will allow the British to win, but the Irish Cabinet votes to support de Valera. The attack fails catastrophically, leaving six men dead and seventy captured. In the aftermath, Collins declares that the IRA can only hold out for a month. In private, he tells Boland that the IRA will be lucky to hold out for another week. To his shock, however, the British soon call for a cease fire. Collins is ordered to London to participate in negotiations with the British, despite objecting that he is not a diplomat. After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921, de Valera erupts upon learning that the terms have been published without his agreement. Collins argues that the Treaty gives them the freedom to achieve the Republic. De Valera and his supporters resign in protest after the Dáil approves the Treaty by 64-57. Both Collins and de Valera try to sway the Irish people in their respective directions. Collins is attacked by an anti-Treaty Republican during a rally, but escapes. In the aftermath, he asks Kitty Kiernan to marry him and she accepts. When the people vote to approve the Treaty, de Valera refuses to accept the results and orders the IRA to seize the Four Courts in Dublin. Ordered by the Cabinet to retake the Four Courts, Collins is appalled at having to fight former comrades. Arthur Griffith, however, informs him that, if the Irish Free State Army will not deal with the IRA, the British Army will. In the subsequent Battle of Dublin, the IRA is driven from the city. Despite Collins' attempts to capture him, Boland is shot by a sentry while trying to swim the Liffey. Devastated by Boland's death, Collins travels to County Cork. He reaches out to de Valera through an intermediary, asking for a peace conference. Without de Valera's knowledge, the intermediary informs Collins that de Valera will meet him at Béal na Bláth the following day. As a convoy of Irish Army vehicles approaches, IRA men open fire from a nearby hillside. Collins is shot and killed. Kitty is informed of his death just after trying on her wedding gown. Completing his story, O'Reilly tells Kitty that Collins would not want her to mourn as long as she has. The film ends with a montage of footage from Collins' funeral. A eulogy states that, although a career soldier, Collins died in a failed effort to remove the gun from Irish politics.civil war fight presidential election freedom fighter chinese civil war biography ireland irish rebellion 1920s",True,tt0117039,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,16900000,0,0,-0.6568047337278107,-1.2635471289974909,,,87651136.13333334,122997802.8,,,-7023891.4,13,15076108.6,5.0,29862159.5,10.0,64612159.5,2.0,58843409.0,4.0,62548947.0,1.0,57717160.5,1.0,67717160.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,173151344.5,248151344.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,58843409.0,62548947.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,30621704.5,36474473.5,2.0,,,,-3758841.6666666665,14241158.333333334,3.0,31220160.0,47072929.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,58843409.0,62548947.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6509157.0,25959157.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,52488593.9,34849709.4,3.5,2.5,56576255.24926193

Robert ""Mac"" MacDougal  is an international art thief. A priceless Rembrandt painting is stolen from an office one night. Gin is sent to investigate Mac as the chief suspect. She tries to entrap him with a proposition, claiming that she is a thief herself. She promises that she will help him steal a priceless Chinese mask from the well-guarded Bedford Palace. Before agreeing, Mac tells Gin Rule Number One: ""How do I know you're not a cop?"" They travel to Scotland and plan the complicated theft at Mac's hideout: an isolated castle. While Mac is busy making final preparations, Gin contacts her boss, Hector Cruz , and informs him of Mac's whereabouts. Little does she know that the island is bugged, allowing Mac to eavesdrop on their conversation. After they complete the theft, Mac accuses Gin of planning to sell the mask to a buyer in Kuala Lumpur and then turn him in. Gin convinces him that her insurance agency job is a cover, and that she has planned an even bigger heist in Kuala Lumpur: 8 billion from the International Clearance Bank in the Petronas Towers. Despite the presence of Cruz and other security watching the building the theft takes place in the final seconds of the new 2000 millennium countdown. Gin pulls the plug on her laptop prematurely and sets off alarms. They narrowly escape the computer vault and are forced to cross the lights hung from the bottom of the bridge linking the two towers. Following a death-defying escape when the cable breaks, Gin and Mac make their way to a ventilation shaft, where Mac explains ""plan B."" Using a micro-parachute they were going to escape down the shaft. Gin lost her parachute earlier in the escape, so Mac gives her his. He tells her to meet him the next morning at the Pudu train station. Gin arrives at the station waiting for Mac. He shows up late with Cruz and the FBI. He explains that the FBI has been looking for her for some time. When he was caught, Mac made a deal to help the agency arrest Gin. However, the aging thief has another plan: to let her go. Mac slips Gin a gun and she holds Mac hostage, threatening to shoot him if the agents follow her. She boards a train and the FBI heads to the next station. Gin jumps trains mid-station and arrives back at Pudu. She tells Mac that she needs him for another job and they both board a train.london, england new year's eve skyscraper burglar distrust undercover blackmail thief heist older man younger woman relationship art thief criminal art theft millennium manhattan, new york city gala kuala lumpur malaysia",False,tt0137494,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,212404396,1,0,2.2182484242424243,15.965307217698705,,,,,,,50781787.85714286,37,63789287.85714286,14.0,-31748929.0,7.0,8251071.0,1.0,-8224415.0,6.0,3275585.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-3100203.0,12.0,25899797.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,15787233.0,21787233.0,1.0,-9158223.666666666,15508443.0,3.0,,,,,,,149531488.5,192531488.5,2.0,127192716.5,179692716.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,-39808601.0,7191399.0,1.0,,,,,,,80498309.14285715,103641166.28571428,7.0,3842000.0,25842000.0,1.0,,,,92627789.66666667,104527789.66666667,3.0,,,,,,,-39808601.0,7191399.0,1.0,-5067854.0,9932146.0,1.0,,,,248700832.0,254700832.0,1.0,,,,294194034.0,352194034.0,1.0,9336621.0,42336621.0,2.0,7531338.4,27751338.4,10.0,,,25303935.214285716,1927060.2142857146,7.75,4.25,73407251.10798967

He meets Daffy , a Scottish traveler who is crazy and rants on about a beach paradise on a secret island and the parasites of civilization. Daffy later commits suicide but leaves Richard a map to the island, convincing him that it exists. Richard meets Françoise  and her boyfriend, Étienne , and persuades them to accompany him to the island, partly out of an infatuation for Françoise. They travel from Bangkok to the shores of Koh Samui in the Gulf of Thailand, where Richard befriends a pair of American surfers. They talk excitedly about the myth of the beach and how it has an almost unlimited supply of marijuana. Richard does not admit his knowledge, but copies his map and slides it under their door the next morning. To finally reach the island, Richard, Françoise and Étienne must swim across to it. When they first arrive on the island, they come across an enormous marijuana plantation guarded by local farmers armed with AK-47 assault rifles. They manage to evade detection. After jumping off a high cliff and landing in a lake below, they are seen by Keaty , who takes them to the beach community. They are cautiously interrogated by the island's leader Sal  regarding their knowledge of the island, but are accepted. The trio are introduced to everybody and over the next few days go on to become integrated into the community. One night while Richard and Françoise are walking down the beach, she tells him that she is falling in love with him. They swim out into the ocean to look at a swarm of bioluminescent plankton, where Françoise kisses Richard and has sex with him on the beach. Despite their attempts to keep the romance a secret, the whole island finds out about it, including Étienne. Although devastated, Étienne says he will not stand in their way if Francoise is happier with Richard. At first the island and its community seem to live up to their idyllic reputation. Richard swims out into the ocean to catch fish with a harpoon and is attacked by a young mako shark, but he stabs it to death with a knife, which gains him much admiration. Events take a turn for the worse when Richard is chosen to accompany Sal to the mainland to acquire supplies, where Richard is inadvertently reunited with the American surfers who are preparing to go to the beach with two girls. Sal overhears their conversation about the copy of the map and confronts Richard, who admits his guilt. In exchange for Sal's silence and Richard's return to the island, Sal blackmails Richard into having sex with her that night. When they return to the island, everything returns to normal until the Swedish fishermen Sten  and Christo  are attacked by a shark while fishing in the ocean. Sten dies almost immediately and Christo is severely injured. The only options for Christo are to go to the mainland to get medical help or stay on the island and take his chances. Christo chooses to stay, not wanting to go near the water after his encounter with the shark, but Sal refuses to allow a doctor to come to the island. Christo's condition worsens, consistently lowering the morale of the whole community, so they take him out into the middle of the jungle and leave him to die. However, Étienne, disgusted by the group's decision, vows to stay with Christo. Later, Sal observes the American surfers on the neighbouring island and assigns Richard the task of watching them so he can obtain the map and destroy it. While he is waiting for the surfers to arrive, Françoise shows up, furious and heartbroken, saying that Sal has told everybody about her affair with Richard at Koh Phangan. Richard cannot cope with his task and retreats into the forest where he becomes temporarily insane, believing that he is communing with the long-dead Daffy, and by this point declaiming  ""the longer I'm away from the others, the less I miss them"". He evades the other islanders and sets lethal traps in an attempt to keep them at bay, at times hallucinating that he is a character in a video game. Meanwhile, the surfers reach the island but are discovered and killed by the marijuana farmers before they can get to the beach. Richard witnesses their executions and retreats to the community to convince Étienne and Françoise to leave the island, believing that all their lives are now in danger. Étienne refuses, not wanting to leave the emaciated Christo, whose leg has become gangrenous. When the other two briefly leave the tent, Richard tearfully smothers Christo to death in a mercy killing to put him out of his misery. When he leaves the tent however, he is struck across the face by a farmer and knocked unconscious. {{Quote box | quoted  width: 22em; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; padding: 0.2em; | quote  center | source Differences from the novel As well as minor differences, the major ones are that Richard is British and Sal is American in the novel. Richard's obsession with War and video games is explained a bit more in the novel. He never sleeps with Françoise despite having feelings for her, which he thinks are reciprocated, saying that he considers Étienne a good guy and would not want to do that to him. He also never sleeps with Sal, nor is it Sal who accompanies him to the mainland for supplies, but rather a character called Jed who does not appear in the film, who in the book is the person who leads Richard, Etienne and Françoise to the community, not Keaty. The ending is different, with Richard and a handful of others attempting to escape from the now crumbling community. In the epilogue, after their successful escape, they move into their respective lives. Richard loses touch with Étienne and Françoise yet finds it hard to be totally freed of the effects of his experiences in that ""parallel universe"".hippie based on novel or book exotic island beach map group dynamics commune shark attack leader thailand community backpacker delusion marijuana youth shark extramarital affair",False,tt0163978,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,144056873,0,0,2.601421825,-1.1627692044360227,12491080.0,16491080.0,,,,,147968902.0,2,182968902.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,52796862.0,7.0,65796862.0,1.0,,0.0,,,120934002.0,4.0,159559002.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12491080.0,16491080.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,12491080.0,16491080.0,1.0,,,,12491080.0,16491080.0,1.0,12491080.0,16491080.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,12491080.0,16491080.0,1.0,,,,-1173477.0,2826523.0,1.0,,,,197552614.0,233552614.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,136108255.33333334,107233255.33333333,1.625,2.0,76394553.2193505

Despite his eminence, Jor-El is unable to convince the Council of his belief that Krypton will soon explode. To save his infant son Kal-El, Jor-El launches a spacecraft containing the child towards Earth, a distant planet with a suitable atmosphere, and where Kal-El's dense molecular structure will give him superhuman powers. Shortly after the launch, Krypton is destroyed. Three years later the ship lands near an American farming town, Smallville, where Kal-El is found by Jonathan and Martha Kent. The Kents take the child back to their farm and raised him as their own son, naming him Clark after Martha's maiden name. At age 18, soon after the death of Jonathan, Clark hears a psychic ""call"", discovering a glowing green crystal in the ship. It compels him to travel to the Arctic, where the crystal builds the Fortress of Solitude, resembling the architecture of Krypton. Inside, a vision of Jor-El explains Clark's origins, educating him in powers and responsibilities. After 12 years, with his powers fully developed, Clark leaves the Fortress with a colorful costume and becomes a reporter at the Daily Planet in Metropolis. He meets and develops a romantic attraction to coworker Lois Lane, but she sees him as awkward and unsophisticated. Lois becomes involved in a helicopter accident where conventional means of rescue are impossible, requiring Clark to use his powers in public for the first time to save her. The rescue of Air Force One and other good deeds make the mysterious ""caped wonder"" a celebrity. The hero visits Lois at home, takes her for a flight over the city, and allows her to interview him for an article in which she names him ""Superman."" Meanwhile, criminal genius Lex Luthor has developed a cunning plan to make a fortune in real estate by buying large amounts of barren desert land and then diverting a nuclear missile test flight to the San Andreas Fault. The missile will sink California and leave Luthor's desert as the new West Coast of the United States, greatly increasing its value. After his incompetent henchman Otis accidentally redirects the first rocket to the wrong place, Luthor's girlfriend Eve Teschmacher successfully changes the course of a second missile. Knowing Superman could stop his plan, Luthor lures him to his underground lair and exposes him to Kryptonite. As Superman weakens, Luthor taunts him by revealing that the first missile is headed to Hackensack, New Jersey, in the opposite direction, knowing that Superman cannot stop both impacts. Teschmacher is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to a slow death. Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition that he will deal with the New Jersey missile first. He is thus too late to stop the second impact, causing a massive earthquake which he battles to correct. While Superman is busy saving others, Lois's car falls into the ground due to an aftershock. It quickly fills with dirt and debris and she suffocates to death. Distraught at being unable to save Lois, Superman ignores Jor-El's warning not to interfere with human history, preferring to remember Jonathan Kent's advice that he must be on Earth for ""a reason"". He travels back in time in order to save Lois, altering history so that her car is never caught in the aftershock. Superman then delivers Luthor and Otis to prison and flies into the sunrise for further adventures.saving the world journalist dc comics crime fighter nuclear missile galaxy superhero based on comic criminal sabotage super power north pole midwest kryptonite superhuman strength aftercreditsstinger save the day",False,tt0078346,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,300218018,0,0,4.458509418181818,15.1328345263288,,,,,16694500.0,23294500.0,,0,,,,0.0,,,11375000.0,1.0,25875000.0,2.0,,0.0,,,-1500000.0,11.0,2000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,58122980.0,60922980.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,43687252.5,47587252.5,2.0,3000000.0,8000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24389000.0,26589000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,40761115.666666664,53761115.666666664,3.0,,,,,,,,,13937500.0,4937500.0,1.5,1.5,68011965.11413558

After learning that his love was cheating on him with his patron, Shakespeare burns his new comedy, Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter, rewriting it as the tragedy Romeo and Juliet. Suffering from writer's block, he is unable to complete the play, but begins auditions for Romeo. A young man named Thomas Kent is cast in the role after impressing Shakespeare with his performance and his love of Shakespeare's previous work. Kent is actually Viola de Lesseps , the daughter of a wealthy merchant who desires to act but, since women are banned from the stage, she must disguise herself. After Shakespeare discovers his star's true identity, he and Viola begin a passionate secret affair. Inspired by her, Shakespeare writes quickly, and benefits from the advice of playwright and friendly rival Christopher 'Kit' Marlowe . Shakespeare and Viola know, however, that their romance is doomed. He is married, albeit long separated from his wife, while Viola's parents have arranged her betrothal to Lord Wessex , an aristocrat who needs money. When Viola is summoned to the court of Queen Elizabeth I , Shakespeare dons a woman's disguise to accompany her as her cousin. At court, he persuades Wessex to bet £50 that a play cannot capture the nature of true love. If Romeo and Juliet is a success, Shakespeare as playwright will win the money. The Queen, who enjoys Shakespeare's plays, agrees to witness the wager. Edmund Tilney , the Master of the Revels, the Queen's official in charge of the theatres, learns that there is a woman in the theatre company at The Rose playhouse, and orders the theatre closed for violating morality and the law. Left without a stage or lead actor, it seems that Romeo and Juliet must close before it even opens, until Richard Burbage , the owner of a competing theatre, the Curtain, offers his stage to Shakespeare. Shakespeare assumes the lead role of Romeo, with a boy actor , playing Juliet. Viola learns that the play will be performed on her wedding day, and after the ceremony secretly travels to the theatre. Shortly before the play begins, the boy playing Juliet starts experiencing the voice change of puberty. Viola replaces him and plays Juliet to Shakespeare's Romeo. Their passionate portrayal of two lovers inspires the entire audience. Tilney arrives at the theatre with Wessex, who has deduced his new bride's location. Tilney plans to arrest the audience and cast for indecency, but the Queen is in attendance. Although she recognizes Viola, the Queen does not unmask her, instead declaring that the role of Juliet is being performed by Thomas Kent. However, even a queen is powerless to end a lawful marriage, so she orders ""Kent"" to fetch Viola so that she may sail with Wessex to the Colony of Virginia. The Queen also states that Romeo and Juliet has accurately portrayed true love so Wessex must pay Shakespeare £50, the exact amount Shakespeare requires to buy a share in the Lord Chamberlain's Men. The Queen then directs ""Kent"" to tell Shakespeare to write something ""a little more cheerful next time, for Twelfth Night"". Viola and Shakespeare part, resigned to their fates. The film closes as Shakespeare begins to write Twelfth Night, Or What You Will imagining his love washed ashore in a strange land after a shipwreck and musing, ""For she will be my heroine for all time, and her name will be...Viola"", a strong young woman castaway who disguises herself as a young man.london, england william shakespeare theatre play queen elizabeth i playwright cross dressing false history francis bacon 16th century acting stratford elizabethan england",False,tt0138097,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,289317794,0,0,10.57271176,-2.5293608277783246,7266485.75,28891485.75,37422413.666666664,55373336.666666664,,,,0,,,52000000.0,0.0,58000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,120681951.66666667,3.0,131348618.33333333,3.0,147685367.5,9.0,181185367.5,2.0,,0.0,,,100823599.5,9.0,116323599.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,168559085.66666666,181559085.66666666,3.0,51729755.5,63104755.5,4.0,,,,,,,,,,11663491.0,28839875.5,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,121714396.33333333,105297729.66666667,2.625,2.0,60772021.118274406

Grace and her father travel in convoy with a number of gunmen through rural Alabama where they stop briefly outside a plantation called Manderlay. As the gangsters converse, a black woman emerges from Manderlay's front gates complaining that someone is about to be whipped for stealing a bottle of wine. Grace enters the plantation and learns that within it, slavery persists, roughly 70 years after the American Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation. Grace is appalled, and insists on staying at the plantation with a small contingent of gunmen and her father's lawyer, Joseph, in order to guarantee the slaves' safe transition to freedom. Shortly after Grace's father and the remaining gangsters depart, Mam , the master of the house, dies, but not before asking Grace to burn a notebook containing ""Mam's Law,"" an exhaustive code of conduct for the entire plantation and all its inhabitants, free and slave. She reads the descriptions of each variety of slave that can be encountered, which include: *Group 1: Proudy Nigger *Group 2: Talkin' Nigger *Group 3: Weepin' Nigger *Group 4: Hittin' Nigger *Group 5: Clownin' Nigger *Group 6: Loser Nigger *Group 7: Pleasing Nigger  The principal seven divisions are each populated by a single adult slave at Manderlay, who congregate daily and converse on a ""parade ground,"" with roman numerals of the numbers 1 through 7 designating where each slave stands. ""Mam's Law"" contains further provisions against the use of cash by slaves, or the felling of trees on the property for timber. All of this information disgusts Grace, and inspires her to take charge of the plantation in order to punish the slave owners and prepare the slaves for life as free individuals. In order to guarantee that the former slaves will not continue to be exploited as sharecroppers, Grace orders Joseph to draw up contracts for all Manderlay's inhabitants, institutionalizing a communistic form of cooperative living in which the white family works as slaves and the blacks collectively own the plantation and its crops. Throughout this process, Grace lectures all those present about the notions of freedom and democracy, using rhetoric entirely in keeping with the ideology of racial equality which most contemporary Americans had yet to embrace. However as the film progresses, Grace fails to embed these principles in Manderlay's community in a form she considers satisfactory. Furthermore, her suggestions for improving the conditions of the community backfire on several occasions, such as using the surrounding trees for timber, which leaves the crops vulnerable to dust storms. After a year of such tribulations, the community harvests its cotton and successfully sells it, marking the high point of Grace's involvement. Subsequently she unenthusiastically has sex with one of the ex-slaves who also steals and gambles away all of the cotton profits. Finally admitting her failure, Grace contacts her father and attempts to leave the plantation only to be stopped by the plantation's blacks. At this point it is revealed that ""Mam's Law"" was not conceived and enforced by Mam or any of the other whites, but instead by Wilhelm , the community's eldest member, as a means of maintaining the status quo after the abolition of slavery, protecting the blacks from a hostile outside world.

Merrick is deformed to the point that he must wear a hood and cap when in public, and Bytes claims he is an imbecile. Treves is professionally intrigued by Merrick's condition and pays Bytes to bring him to the Hospital so that he can examine him. There, Treves presents Merrick to his colleagues in a lecture theatre, displaying him as a physiological curiosity. Treves draws attention to Merrick's most life-threatening deformity, his abnormally large skull, which compels him to sleep with his head resting upon his knees, as the weight of his skull would asphyxiate him if he were to ever lie down. On Merrick's return, Bytes beats him severely enough that a sympathetic apprentice alerts Treves, who returns him to the hospital. Bytes accuses Treves of likewise exploiting Merrick for his own ends, leading the surgeon to resolve to do what he can to help the unfortunate man. The ward nurses are horrified by Merrick's appearance, so Treves places him in a quarantine room under the watchful care of the formidable matron, Mrs. Mothershead. Mr. Carr-Gomm, the hospital's Governor, is reluctant to house Merrick , as the hospital is not designed as a residence for ""incurables"". To persuade Carr-Gomm that Merrick has potential, Treves coaches him to recite a few polite phrases. Carr-Gomm sees through the ruse, but as he walks away, both men are astonished to hear Merrick recite the 23rd Psalm. Shocked by this display of intelligence, Carr-Gomm allows Merrick to remain. Merrick is gradually revealed to be sophisticated and articulate. Carr-Gomm arranges a suite of rooms for him to reside in at the hospital, and Merrick passes his days reading, drawing and making a model of a church visible through his window. One day, Treves brings him to take afternoon tea at home together with his wife, Ann. Merrick, overwhelmed by the familial love he perceives in the domesticity about him, shows them his most treasured possession, a picture of his mother, and expresses his wish that she would love him if she could only see what ""lovely friends"" he now has. Later, Merrick begins to receive society visitors in his rooms, including the celebrated actress Madge Kendal. He becomes a popular object of curiosity and charity to high society. As these connections and visits increase, Mrs. Mothershead  complains to Treves that he is still being treated as a freak show attraction, albeit in a more upper class, celebrated style. For Treves' part, this observation  deeply trouble him, and he begins to question whether or not he has done the right thing. And while Merrick is treated well during the daytime, the Night Porter secretly makes money by bringing punters from nearby pubs to gawk at Merrick. Threatened dissent at a board meeting toward the decision to keep Merrick indefinitely is overturned when the hospital's Royal Patron, Alexandra, pays a surprise visit with a message from Queen Victoria, stating that Merrick will receive permanent care at the hospital and the necessary funds have been arranged. But Merrick is then returned to his old life when Bytes gains access to his room during one of the Night Porter's late-night ""viewings"". Bytes abducts Merrick to continental Europe, where he is once again put on show and subjected to cruelty and neglect. Treves, consumed with guilt over Merrick's plight, takes action against the night porter with the help of Mrs. Mothershead. Merrick escapes with the help of his fellow freak show attractions, and makes it back to London. However, he is harassed by a group of boys at Liverpool Street station, and accidentally knocks down a young girl. He is chased, unmasked, and cornered by an angry mob, at which point he cries out, ""I am not an elephant! I am not an animal! I am a human being! I ... am ... a ... man!"", before collapsing. When the police return Merrick to the hospital, he is reinstated to his rooms. He recovers a little but it is soon clear he is dying from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. As a treat, Mrs. Kendal arranges an evening at the musical theatre. Resplendent in white tie, he rises in the Royal Box to an ovation, having had the performance dedicated to him from Mrs Kendal. That night, back at the hospital, Merrick thanks Treves for all he has done and finishes his model of the nearby church. Imitating one of his sketches on the wall—a sleeping child—he removes the pillows that have allowed him to sleep in an upright position, lies down on his bed and dies, consoled by a vision of his mother, Mary Jane Merrick, quoting Alfred Lord Tennyson's ""Nothing Will Die"".exploitation biography based on a true story hospital curiosity sideshow disfigurement physical deformity freak 19th century dignity",False,tt0080678,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,26010864,0,0,4.2021728,5.398296094146566,,,,,,,28750000.0,3,50750000.0,1.0,40365189.666666664,14.0,45665189.666666664,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,24450000.0,14.0,28350000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29403456.666666668,37103456.666666664,3.0,,,,58122980.0,60922980.0,1.0,39900000.0,45300000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41588396.55555555,31188396.555555556,3.875,1.6666666666666667,79035550.72041805

Shown are some of the key moments of Alexander's youth, his invasion of the mighty Persian Empire and his death. It also outlines his early life, including his difficult relationship with his father Philip II of Macedon, his strained feeling towards his mother Olympias, the unification of the Greek city-states and the two Greek Kingdoms  under the Hellenic League,Bowra, C.M., [1957] , The Greek Experience, London: Phoenix, Orion Books Ltd, ISBN 1-85799-122-2, p. 9. and the conquest of the Persian Empire in 331 BC. It also details his plans to reform his empire and the attempts he made to reach the end of the then known world. The story begins 40 years after 323 BC, around 283 BC, with Ptolemy I Soter, who narrates throughout the film. We see Alexander's daily life and the strained relationship between his parents. Alexander grows up with his mother Olympias and his tutor Aristotle, where he finds interest in love, honour, music, exploration, poetry and military combat. His relationship with his father is destroyed when Philip marries Attalus's niece, Eurydice. After Philip is assassinated, Alexander becomes king of Macedonia. Having briefly mentioned his punitive razing of Thebes and burning of Persepolis, Ptolemy gives an overview of Alexander's west-Persian campaign, including his being declared as the son of Zeus by the Oracle of Amun at Siwa Oasis, his great battle against the Persian Emperor Darius III in the Battle of Gaugamela and his eight-year campaign across Asia. Also shown are Alexander's private relationships with his childhood friend Hephaestion and later his wife Roxana. Hephaestion compares Alexander to Achilles, to which Alexander replies that, if he is Achilles, Hephaestion must be his Patroclus . When Hephaestion mentions that Patroclus died first, Alexander pledges that, if Hephaestion should die first, he will follow him into the afterlife. Hephaestion shows extensive jealousy when he sees Alexander with Roxana and deep sadness when he marries her, going so far as to attempt to keep her away from him after Alexander murders Cleitus the Black in India. After initial objection from his soldiers, Alexander convinces them to join him into his final and bloodiest battle, The Battle of Hydaspes. He is severely injured with an arrow but survives and is celebrated. Later on, Hephaestion succumbs to an unknown illness either by chance or perhaps poison, speculated in the movie to be Typhus carried with him from India. Alexander, full of grief and anger, distances himself from his wife, despite her pregnancy, believing that she has killed Hephaestion. He dies less than three months after Hephaestion, in the same manner, keeping his promise that he would follow him.gay aristotle egypt greece persia elephant campaign alexander the great homosexuality gay relationship ancient world ancient greece 4th century bc",True,tt0346491,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,167298192,0,0,0.07934317419354839,1.9257596443831189,,,-39808601.0,7191399.0,16611471.818181818,57841714.81818182,-143702.0,1,4856298.0,1.0,24732042.0,1.0,107232042.0,2.0,58797912.0,20.0,94672912.0,4.0,,0.0,,,14478942.5,6.0,24353982.25,4.0,47396191.71428572,27.0,73181906.0,7.0,,0.0,,,4033068.25,29.0,14783068.25,4.0,,,,-198097.4,21901902.6,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,64765282.5,70015282.5,2.0,,,,24722807.6,56322807.6,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,32397564.25,42447564.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,82615282.5,86765282.5,2.0,53297897.5,109797897.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,405956989.3333333,476956989.3333333,3.0,,,53180034.75,24882409.07738095,10.5,3.6666666666666665,84824632.31357588

The ""Silver Surfer"" ([[Doug Jones  drags him into the upper atmosphere then drops him back toward Earth. During his fall Johnny finds his abilities fluctuating, and barely manages to survive the fall, successfully flying at the last minute. Later, Sue and Johnny switch powers when they touch, prompting Reed to examine Johnny revealing that exposure to the Surfer has set Johnny's molecular structure in flux, allowing him to switch powers with his teammates through physical contact. Tracing the cosmic energy of the Surfer, Reed discovers that a series of planets the alien had visited have all been destroyed. The Surfer has been creating deep artificial craters around the globe. Reed determines that the next crater will appear in London, and the team travel there. They arrive too late to stop the crater, and the river Thames drains into it. Afterwards, both Reed and Sue contemplate abandoning their lives as superheroes in order to provide a normal life to raise a family. The Surfer's movements around the globe bring him past Latveria, where the cosmic energy affects Victor von Doom , freeing him from two years as a metal statue. Doom, able to move again but scarred, traces the Surfer to the Russell Glacier and makes him an offer to join forces. When the Surfer rebuffs him, Doom attacks. The Surfer returns fire, blasting Doom through the ice. The cosmic energy of the Surfer's blast heals Doom's body. Doom leverages his experience into a deal with the American military, who force the Fantastic Four to work with Doom. Deducing that the Surfer's board is the source of his power, Reed develops a tachyon pulse generator that will separate him from it, while Victor works on an unknown remote-like machine. In the Black Forest, Sue is confronted by the Surfer, during which he reveals he is merely a servant to the destroyer of worlds, and regrets the destruction he causes. The military opens fire on the Surfer, which distracts him and allows the four to fire the pulse, separating the Surfer from his board. The military imprisons the Surfer in Siberia, while they torture him for information. Sue uses her powers to sneak into his cell, where she learns more information from the Surfer. He tells her his master was known by the people of his world as Galactus, a massive cloud-like cosmic entity which feeds on life-bearing planets to survive, and that his board is a homing beacon which is summoning Galactus to the planet. The Silver Surfer has to serve Galactus who will otherwise destroy not only his loved ones but his planet. Doom, using the device he created earlier, steals the board from the compound, killing the majority of the Army presence there at the same time. The Fantastic Four rescue the Surfer, and pursue Doom in the Fantasticar, confronting him in Shanghai. During the battle, Sue is mortally wounded. With the Surfer powerless, Johnny absorbs the combined powers of the entire team in order to battle the cosmic energy-empowered Doom. Johnny succeeds in breaking Doom's control over the Surfer's board, and Ben Grimm  uses a nearby crane to knock Doom into the harbor, however, Galactus has already arrived, and Sue dies in Reed's arms. The Surfer regains the control of his board, and his power is restored. He revives Sue and chooses to defend Earth, flying into Galactus. The conflict results in a massive blast of energy that engulfs Galactus in a cosmic rift, and apparently kills the Surfer as well. Reed and Sue get married in Japan. The credits cut back to a shot of the Silver Surfer's seemingly lifeless body floating through space, but his eyes open and his board races towards him, indicating that he is alive.fire helicopter surfboard mask satellite airplane transformation forest resurrection sequel superhero based on comic space wedding explosion scientist interrogation double cross fantastic four military earth in peril superhuman strength duringcreditsstinger invisibility silver surfer forcefield elasticity",False,tt0486576,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,289047763,0,0,1.2234443307692309,-6.117028646878049,688112356.75,804362356.75,160116641.33333334,283449974.6666667,,,83567857.0,3,203567857.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-17982197.0,0.0,32017803.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,42027970.0,1.0,48027970.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-15886141.0,17.0,14613859.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,39558115.0,74558115.0,1.0,-12999752.0,7000248.0,1.0,249359555.0,459359555.0,1.0,,,,249359555.0,459359555.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,61505388.0,156505388.0,1.0,,,,249359555.0,459359555.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,74556872.25,22931872.25,2.625,1.25,105980128.20199434

Tessa has been murdered at a crossroads along with her Kenyan driver. Her colleague doctor Arnold Bluhm  is initially suspected of her murder but is later found to have been murdered on the same day as Tessa. Various rumours abound that the two were having an affair; however, it is later revealed that Bluhm was in fact gay. In flashbacks, we see how in London Justin met his future wife Tessa, an outspoken humanitarian and Amnesty activist, falls in love with her and how she persuades him to take her back with him to Kenya. As the mystery surrounding his wife's death unfolds, Justin is radicalised in his determination to get to the bottom of her murder. He soon runs up against a drug corporation that is using Kenya's population for fraudulent testing of a tuberculosis drug  with known harmful side effects and disregards the well-being of its poor African test subjects. Danny Huston plays Sandy Woodrow, the British High Commissioner on the scene. Bill Nighy is Sir Bernard Pellegrin, head of the Africa Desk at the Foreign Office and thus Justin and Sandy's boss. After finding out the truth about what happened to Tessa, Justin is killed at the place where she died. Justin's gentle but diligent attention to his plants is a recurring background theme, from which image the film's title is derived.aids diplomat nairobi politician pharmaceutical industry rwandan genocide kenya cancer morgue",False,tt0387131,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,82466670,0,0,2.2986668,-2.6760407675788414,84648887.0,154648887.0,48335305.333333336,151668638.66666666,60293714.0,130293714.0,42030831.5,9,61155831.5,4.0,41040784.333333336,7.0,75374117.66666667,3.0,-5396999.0,1.0,14603001.0,1.0,101657536.0,2.0,123657536.0,3.0,-64831034.0,3.0,35168966.0,1.0,53667076.333333336,13.0,77000409.66666667,3.0,321889678.0,6.0,363889678.0,1.0,,0.0,,,23286865.0,100786865.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31274797.0,43274797.0,1.0,19673209.666666668,39939876.333333336,3.0,,,,,,,38214766.0,50048099.333333336,3.0,2467327.0,3000000.0,1.0,,,,2300000.0,13300000.0,1.0,,,,294194034.0,352194034.0,1.0,77719885.0,82719885.0,1.0,33047760.0,42047760.0,2.0,28976270.0,96976270.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,-23539242.0,6460758.0,1.0,307542290.0,399542290.0,4.0,,,107264219.97619048,70008267.59523809,5.125,2.2857142857142856,109858494.28372188

Two tiger cubs are playing when the younger cub  comes upon a young civet. Sangha chases the civet into its burrow and the mother civet appears and chases Sangha up a tree. The older tiger cub  appears and chases the mother civet back into its burrow. Eventually, humans come across them, and the tigress arrives to protect the cubs. She picks Sangha up and runs for safety. Kumal follows, but can't keep up and falls behind. The cubs' father appears, but the men have caught up with them and he is shot dead by McRory. McRory is an unscrupulous explorer, big-game hunter and temple looter. He discovers Kumal and befriends him, but McRory is arrested for stealing from the ancient temple and Kumal is kept by the chief in the Cambodian village where McRory had been staying. The chief then sells Kumal to a circus where he is to be the star attraction. Sangha remains in the jungle with his mother, but both are soon trapped by McRory as game for a vain Khmer prince to hunt. The mother is shot in the ear and thought to be dead before she jumps up and runs off with a hole in her ear. Sangha is discovered by young Raoul, son of the French administrator, Normandin, and becomes the child's pet. However, Raoul's mother's dog, Bittsi, a schipperke, is a constant antagonist to the young tiger. Kumal is trained by cruel circus ringmaster Zerbino to do tricks, such as jumping through a flaming hoop. Sangha meanwhile dwells peacefully with Raoul until he is at last cornered by Bittsi following a prolonged chase. In self-defence, Sangha attacks Bittsi, badly wounding although not killing him. This provokes a hysterical reaction from the household, particularly Raoul's mother, who insists that the cub has now ""got a taste of blood"" and Sangha is given away. As a result, he is made a part of the prince's palace menagerie, where he quickly gains a reputation as a ferocious animal. Sangha and Kumal are now very close to each other. The prince then decides to hold a festival in which a battle between two great beasts - the brother tigers - will be the centerpiece. When placed in the cage before the audience during the festival, the two brothers do not immediately recognize each other, and Kumal is afraid to fight. However, when the brothers finally recognize each other they begin to play together instead of fighting, and the audience likes this but the trainers don't. The trainer attempts to antagonize the tigers into fighting, but as he opens the cage to shoot one, the tigers escape, managing to frighten the trainers and the audience into the cage themselves. The two tigers escape, and McRory is determined to hunt them down. After Kumal showing Sangha how to jump through fire to escape, McRory and Raoul find them. However, as McRory takes aim at Sangha, Kumal appears, and demonstrates that he remembers the sweets McRory used to give him. McRory puts down his gun and vows never to hunt again. The two brothers make their way back to their temple home in the jungle where they meet up with their mother .

She also finds a card for the Trans-Siberian restaurant, which is owned by Semyon , an old vor in the Russian Mafia. Anna thus sets out to track down the girl's family so that she can find a home for the baby girl, having meetings with Semyon who she initially regards as friendly. Anna's mother Helen  does not discourage her, but Anna's Ukrainian uncle and self-described former KGB officer, Stepan , whom Anna asks for help with the translation of the diary, urges caution. Through translation of the diary, Anna comes to learn that Semyon and his unstable son Kirill , had abused the girl, addicted her to heroin, forced her into prostitution and raped her. Ultimately Anna realises that the baby was fathered by Semyon. Semyon's driver is Nikolai Luzhin , who also serves as the family cleaner, dumping murdered bodies in the River Thames. Through Nikolai, Semyon, fearing prosecution, promises to give the location of the girl's family to Anna if she hands back the diary. Nikolai takes the diary but does not give a location, instead later urging Anna to keep the baby in the UK as the girl's home is a bad village to grow up in. Semyon distrusts Anna's uncle Stepan due to his former position and ethnicity, ordering a hit on him. Nikolai accepts and soon Stepan goes missing. As Nikolai's star rises within the vory, an impressed Semyon sponsors him as a full member, with the appropriate tattoos, due in part to Nikolai's protection of Semyon's incompetent son who authorized a hit on a rival Chechen vory leader with the help of a kurdish associate, Azim. The hit was not approved by Semyon and was ill-advised; the Chechen gang are now coming to London to seek vengeance having killed Azim's nephew. Semyon hatches a plan to trick Nikolai into temporarily taking Kirill's place during a meeting at the baths with Azim. The Chechens attack, thinking Nikolai is Kirill, but Nikolai kills them both and ends up in hospital with severe wounds as a result. It is then revealed that Nikolai is actually an FSB agent who has infiltrated the gang, working under license by the British Government and a Senior Officer . As part of his undercover duties, Nikolai was able to read Tatiana's diary before Semyon had it destroyed and hatched a plan to have Semyon arrested for statutory rape, with a paternity test of the Tatiana's baby as evidence. Stepan is also safe, hiding in a 5-star hotel in Edinburgh for protection. Semyon orders Kirill to kidnap the baby girl and kill her but as Kirill sits by the Thames, almost unable to throw the little girl into the river, Nikolai and Anna find him and persuade him to give the baby back. Nikolai and Kirill embrace as Nikolai tells him that his father is finished and they are now the bosses. Nikolai and Anna then kiss as they part for the last time. Nikolai succeeds Semyon's place as boss of the organization and Anna gains custody of Tatiana's baby, whom she raises as Christine.london, england jealousy parent child relationship underworld undercover hitman diary gangster human trafficking midwife murder orphan motorcycle bathhouse",False,tt0765443,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,56106607,1,0,0.08944867961165047,-6.117028646878049,18596382.75,39346382.75,9341589.0,20087742.846153848,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,35479076.0,2.0,57479076.0,1.0,-1484190.0,16.0,2015810.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-3682182.0,5.0,58817818.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,16870722.0,36870722.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,16742935.5,31742935.5,2.0,36444921.333333336,54278254.666666664,3.0,18450201.5,30950201.5,2.0,1687406.25,7312406.25,4.0,,,,,,,16742935.5,31742935.5,2.0,16742935.5,31742935.5,2.0,,,,,,,15628121.5,48128121.5,2.0,,,,,,,44917025.0,80917025.0,3.0,67646616.16666667,104229949.5,6.0,12787442.0,41287442.0,2.0,,,,59259348.25,78809348.25,4.0,44771968.5,79771968.5,2.0,378042400.3333333,434709067.0,3.0,,,39437568.0,10104234.666666666,2.875,1.3333333333333333,105980128.20199434

A dictatorial organization called the Magisterium exercises power in the secular world. Lyra Belacqua, an orphan of Jordan College along with her dæmon Pantalaimon , spins tales of the Gobblers, whom she and her friends believe are snatching children. Forced to hide in a closet, Lyra learns that her uncle Lord Asriel is about to present a proposal to the master and scholars of Jordan College. She listens when the Master and Scholars come in to view a slide of Asriel's. Asriel presents evidence that particles called ""Dust"" exist. Over the objections of the Magisterium, the college funds Asriel's expedition to the far north to investigate the Dust. He believes it originates in a parallel universe and enters a person's body via their dæmon. The Magisterium has secretly been experimenting on children to discover a way to inoculate them against its influences. At dinner Lyra meets Mrs. Coulter, who insists on taking Lyra north as her assistant. Before Lyra leaves, the master of the college entrusts her with the only remaining alethiometer . This device, he tells her, reveals the truth. The Magisterium has destroyed all the others; he warns her to tell no one she has it. Lyra accepts the gift, promising to keep it hidden. At Mrs. Coulter's house, Lyra mentions 'space dust'. Mrs. Coulter warns her never to mention it again. Lyra refuses to remove her shoulder bag because it holds the alethiometer. Mrs. Coulter's dæmon attacks Pan, causing Lyra to give in. After hiding the alethiometer under her pillow, Lyra and Pan search Mrs. Coulter's secret room, where they discover that Mrs. Coulter is head of the General Oblation Board, the ""Gobblers"", who have been kidnapping local children. She also discovers that her best friend Roger and her Gyptian friend Billy have been taken by the Gobblers. Hearing Mrs. Coulter call out for her, Lyra and Pan meet her in a hallway. Running to her bedroom, they see Mrs. Coulter's dæmon holding the alethiometer. Changing into a hawk, Pan swoops down, grabs the alethiometer, and flies out of an open window. Lyra escapes behind him, slamming the window on Mrs. Coulter's dæmon. The ""Gobblers"" pursue her, but she is saved by some Gyptians. Aboard a Gyptian boat heading north to rescue their children, Lyra shows the alethiometer to a Gyptian wise man, Farder Coram, who advises her in its use. On deck that night Serafina Pekkala, the witch queen, tells Lyra that the missing children are in a place called Bolvangar&nbsp;— a place shunned by all living things. Mrs. Coulter sends two mechanical spy flies after Lyra and Pan; one is batted away but the other is caught and sealed in a tin can by Farder Coram, who explains that the spy fly has a sting with a sleeping poison. At a Norwegian port, Lyra is befriended by a cowboy aeronaut named Lee Scoresby, who advises her to hire an armoured bear. Exiled in shame, the giant polar bear Iorek Byrnison has been tricked out of his armour by the local townspeople, for whom he now performs menial jobs for buckets of whisky. Using the alethiometer Lyra tells Iorek where to find his armour. Armoured again, the fearsome Iorek and his friend Lee Scoresby join the trek northward. That night while riding on Iorek's back, Lyra finds a cowering Billy separated from his dæmon. Lyra reunites Billy with his mother just as the group is attacked by Samoyeds who capture Lyra. Taken to the armoured bear king Ragnar, Lyra tricks him into fighting Iorek one on one. After killing Ragnar, King Iorek carries Lyra near Bolvangar, to a thin ice bridge. Reaching the station, Lyra is taken to eat with the missing children. While hiding again Lyra discovers that the Magisterium scientists, under the guidance of Mrs. Coulter, are performing experiments to sever the bond between a child and their dæmon in a process known as intercision. Caught spying, Lyra and Pan are thrown in the intercision chamber, causing them to scream in agony and eventually faint. Mrs. Coulter rescues Lyra and takes her and Pan to her quarters. When Lyra wakes up she is comforted by Mrs. Coulter, who tells Lyra that she is her mother. Lyra then guesses that Lord Asriel is her father. When Mrs. Coulter asks for the alethiometer, Lyra gives her the can containing the spy fly. The spy fly stings Mrs. Coulter, knocking her and her daemon out. Lyra runs to the room with the intercision machine and toggles the switches and dials wide open. The growing chain reaction builds as Lyra yanks a control box loose and hurls it into the intercision machine, causing it to explode. This sets off a series of explosions that tear the facility apart. As alarms whoop, Mrs. Coulter is found and carried outside. Outside, the children are attacked by Tartar mercenaries and their wolf dæmons. The battle is joined by Iorek, the Gyptians, and a band of flying witches led by Serafina Pekkala. The Tartars are defeated and the children are rescued. Rather than returning south, Lyra, Roger and Iorek fly north with Lee Scoresby in search of Lord Asriel. Unaware that he is in mortal danger, Lord Asriel has set up a laboratory to investigate the glowing Dust from another world, but Lyra is certain that, once she delivers the alethiometer to her father, the two of them will be able to make things right.england based on novel or book compass experiment lordship uncle polar bear airship orphan animal alternative universe based on young adult novel",False,tt0385752,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,372234864,1,0,1.0679714666666666,-6.117028646878049,,,3547396.125,30395896.125,,,73306733.57142857,12,126735305.0,7.0,110306880.5,4.0,155681880.5,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,208367659.5,3.0,295867659.5,2.0,53518456.8,24.0,130358456.8,5.0,176936761.0,4.0,275270094.3333333,3.0,11458340.0,23.0,20458340.0,1.0,,,,44753975.333333336,60420642.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,102000000.0,129000000.0,1.0,88240991.66666667,164012658.33333334,6.0,269756260.0,340089593.3333333,3.0,-5396999.0,14603001.0,1.0,,,,,,,27305308.5,34330308.5,4.0,-2832452.3333333335,13667547.666666666,3.0,,,,,,,147702480.0,221369146.66666666,3.0,,,,45868327.0,71868327.0,1.0,2969179.5,24219179.5,4.0,,,,146465913.83333334,219265913.83333334,6.0,,,,23285718.25,46035718.25,4.0,,,,101150026.75,141150026.75,4.0,,,167395289.35555556,105649138.56190476,8.75,3.6666666666666665,105980128.20199434

A guard is constantly posted at a break in the wall to prevent anyone from crossing. At the beginning of the story, Dunstan Thorne crosses over the wall and into the Wall Market. There, he meets an enslaved princess named Una, who offers him a glass snowdrop in exchange for a kiss. Nine months later, the Wall Guard delivers a baby to Dunstan, saying his name is Tristan. Eighteen years later, in the royal palace of Stormhold, the king is on his deathbed. He throws a ruby into the sky, decreeing that the first of his fratricidal sons to recover it will be the new king. The gem collides with a star, and they fall together and land elsewhere in Stormhold. The king's two remaining sons, Primus and Septimus independently search for the gem. In Wall, Tristan Thorne sees the star fall behind the wall, and vows to retrieve it for the object of his infatuation, Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. His father reveals to him that his mother is from the other side of the wall, and gives him a Babylon candle that she had left for him, which instantly transports the user to any desired location. Tristan lights it and is transported to the fallen star, a beautiful woman named Yvaine. He promptly chains her in order to take her home to Victoria. Three ancient witches in Stormhold also learn of the fallen star and resolve to find her, intending to eat her heart in order to recover their youth and replenish their magical power. The leader of the witches, Lamia, consumes the remains of the heart they had cut from a star that had fallen centuries before and was captured by the witches. Regaining temporary youth, Lamia hunts down Yvaine and sets a trap for her, magically conjuring an inn in the countryside. Yvaine is weary and unaccustomed to daytime travel, so Tristan chains her to a tree and promises to return with food. In his absence, a unicorn frees Yvaine, then unwittingly takes her to Lamia's inn. Tristan discovers Yvaine gone and lies down to rest. The stars whisper to Tristan, warning of Yvaine's danger and begging him to save her as the last star who fell was murdered by the three witches and her heart eaten; instructing him to get on a passing stagecoach, which happens to be Primus'. Tristan and Primus arrive at the inn, interrupting Lamia's attempt to kill Yvaine. Lamia kills Primus, but Tristan and Yvaine escape using the stub of the Babylon candle. Because they are each thinking of their respective homes, the candle takes Tristan and Yvaine into the storm clouds, between the earth and the stars, where they are captured by pirates in a flying ship. They befriend the kind-hearted Captain Shakespeare, who teaches Tristan how to fence and fight, and gives him and Yvaine clean clothing. Septimus arrives at the site of the inn and discovers that he is the last surviving son of the king, only needing to find the stone to claim the throne. He learns that it is in the possession of the fallen star and that the heart of a star grants immortality. After leaving Captain Shakespeare's ship, Tristan and Yvaine make their way to a village near the wall, where they spend the night at an inn. Come morning, Tristan leaves Yvaine sleeping and goes to Wall, bringing with him a lock of her hair, to tell Victoria that he won't marry her, having fallen in love with Yvaine. When the lock turns to dust, he realizes that Yvaine will die if she crosses the wall, and he rushes back to save her. Yvaine wakes up to find Tristan gone, and she starts walking toward the wall, believing that he abandoned her to go back to Victoria. Tristan's mother Una notices Yvaine walking to her doom, so she takes the caravan of her enslaver, a witch named Ditchwater Sal, to the wall to stop her. Lamia arrives and, after killing Sal, captures both Una and Yvaine, taking them to the witches' castle. Septimus and Tristan both pursue Lamia and meet at the castle, agreeing to work together for the time being. Barging into the witches' castle, Septimus recognizes the princess as his long-lost sister. Una and Tristan meet for the first time, and she informs him that she is his mother. Septimus and Tristan fight the witches, killing two of them, but Lamia kills Septimus using a voodoo doll, then uses it to make his corpse fight Tristan. Tristan disposes of the corpse. Lamia then disarms Tristan in a swordfight and is about to finish him off, when she breaks down over the loss of her two sisters. Lamia seemingly frees Yvaine but instead reveals her feigned defeat to be a ruse meant to bolster Yvaine's broken heart. As the witch-queen bears down on them, Yvaine realises that Tristan's return has left her heartbroken no more. She tells him to close his eyes and hold her tight. As they embrace, her love for Tristan allows her to shine once again, vaporising Lamia in a blinding flash of pure starlight. Tristan retrieves the jewel that Yvaine was wearing. Una explains that, as her son, Tristan is the last male heir of Stormhold. Tristan becomes the new king with Yvaine as his queen. Later, after eighty years of ruling Stormhold, they both use a Babylon candle to ascend to the sky, where Tristan also becomes a star. Since Yvaine ""gave her heart"" to Tristan, the two will live forever in the sky.witch based on novel or book new love prince beauty kingdom wall transformation falling star royalty unrequited love good vs evil goat pirate fratricide air pirate gender bender turned into animal",True,tt0486655,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,135560026,1,0,0.9365718000000001,-6.117028646878049,-3269636.0588235296,54083305.11764706,5350214.0,11850214.0,,,235000000.0,4,435000000.0,1.0,-11234415.0,3.0,18765585.0,1.0,87040242.66666667,19.0,135040242.66666666,3.0,21069713.2,29.0,51969713.2,5.0,-9794452.0,3.0,23455548.0,2.0,245613864.5,2.0,318113864.5,2.0,42856604.5,12.0,78444104.5,4.0,14465829.0,11.0,32915829.0,2.0,19981466.333333332,63314799.666666664,3.0,,,,32078258.5,42078258.5,2.0,,,,102643520.75,162893520.75,4.0,,,,5350214.0,11850214.0,1.0,488972330.3333333,597805663.6666666,6.0,105565383.625,182940383.625,8.0,,,,24128229.75,31090729.75,4.0,,,,39454043.0,47704043.0,2.0,40538964.0,87738964.0,5.0,,,,,,,208138716.0,348138716.0,3.0,,,,81643158.0,211643158.0,1.0,,,,119938639.5,206271972.83333334,6.0,177610150.0,244110150.0,6.0,32435097.25,100685097.25,4.0,18760049.0,47010049.0,2.0,,,,77390598.25,133265598.25,4.0,,,136713110.85833332,78127173.35833333,10.375,2.5,105980128.20199434

P. Inman , a quiet man from a provincial North Carolina town. He meets Ada , the new preacher's daughter. However, as their relationship begins to develop, the Civil War begins and Inman is compelled to join the fray. The film opens in July 1864 at the Siege of Petersburg. After suffering a serious wound, Inman is sent to a Confederate military hospital where he recovers alongside other soldiers who, like himself, have become disaffected by the prolonged and horrifically destructive war. As he faces the inevitability of being sent back to the war, and after receiving a letter from Ada imploring him to return home to Cold Mountain, he decides to desert the army and sets off in the night to make the perilous journey home. Inman's journey to return to Ada is fraught with danger and unexpected encounters with other desperate individuals, some treacherous and some sympathetic. He faces starvation, extreme weather, and the constant harassment of the ruthless Confederate Home Guard, led by the vicious Teague , sent to track down deserters. He is at times aided in his journey by strangers equally affected by the horrors of war. As Inman journeys home, Ada is left destitute and desperate back at Cold Mountain after the death of her father. She is aided by a young woman named Ruby Thewes  who is determined to help Ada and her farm at Black Cove survive through the worsening conditions of the war-ravaged South. Ruby is reunited with her estranged fiddle-playing deserter father, Stobrod, whose return threatens to bring disaster to Black Cove. The film alternates between Inman's epic journey and Ada's trials at Cold Mountain, while telling through flashbacks the story of Ada and Inman's brief love affair before the war tore them apart.loss of loved one deserter love of one's life early america",True,tt0159365,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,173013509,0,0,1.190044417721519,-14.415123713336484,68284735.07142857,90513702.07142857,85291388.0,96291388.0,,,8416491.0,4,49916491.0,2.0,85396425.5,8.0,134146425.5,4.0,256929795.0,2.0,281929795.0,1.0,,0.0,,,20285785.0,7.0,36285785.0,3.0,11230406.0,5.0,23730406.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,103988212.5,120988212.5,2.0,,,,552380100.6666666,650046767.3333334,3.0,,,,851475550.0,976475550.0,1.0,204976425.0,231976425.0,1.0,,,,,,,76422768.0,90339434.66666667,6.0,52000000.0,58000000.0,1.0,,,,43973658.666666664,90140325.33333333,3.0,90957924.0,116457924.0,2.0,,,,28363635.0,39363635.0,1.0,,,,204976425.0,231976425.0,1.0,,,,-38546877.0,8083123.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,528225987.5,604225987.5,2.0,80989651.0,172989651.0,1.0,264692268.0,351692268.0,1.0,,,105201780.5,76451780.5,3.25,2.4,79569518.43496008

As Mo reads the story, a red velvet hood appears as a narrator explains that people known as ""Silver Tongues"" are born with the gift that whenever they read a story out loud, the story becomes real. 12 years later, Mortimer and Meggie  are in the European countrysides looking for a book. Mo has learned of his gifts, and nine years prior, Resa had vanished, much to the distress of her extended family. Hearing the calling of books from a bookstore one day, Mo ventures inside. He finds the book Inkheart and is overwhelmed with a mixture of fear and joy. At the same time, Dustfinger , a character from Inkheart appears and attempts to persuade Mo to read him back into the book. Mo refuses to do so and hastily escapes with Meggie and travels to Italy to pay a visit to Meggie's great aunt Elinor Loredan . Elinor accuses Resa of running off, which upsets Meggie, but the two make amends when expressing their mutual passion for valuable books, and Elinor lets Meggie stay in her library to read. Dustfinger appears again, but this time having informed the book's villain Capricorn  and bringing his minion Basta  to capture Mo and his family and take back the book, in the meantime destroying Elinor's valuable collection of books. The trio are taken to Capricorn's castle and imprisoned in the stables, which house various creatures from storybooks, such as the ticking Crocodile from Peter Pan, flying monkeys from The Wizard of Oz, and the title character of The Hound of the Baskervilles, as well as the minotaur from the story of Theseus and a unicorn. Mo explains his gift to Meggie and Elinor, stating that when he reads a person out of a book, someone from the real world is sent into it, hence the disappearance of his wife. They are abruptly taken to meet with Capricorn, and meet his current reader Darius ([[John Thomson , whose perpetual stutter had caused those he had read out of the book to only come halfway out of the story, with various deformities and the words of the stories written on their faces. Capricorn breaks his promise to Dustfinger to have him read back into the book, and throws it onto the fire, burning it. In his despair, Dustfinger leaves the group and runs to the kitchen, where he learns that one of the servant girls, a trusted friend of his who is constantly attempting to escape, is in fact Mo's lost wife Resa, whose halfway transition from the book she was trapped in has left her without a voice. He gives her the access to escape and departs. After reading from The Arabian Nights and giving Capricorn a stash of treasure, one of Ali Baba's thieves, Farid , is summoned from the story and joins the storyteller and his family in imprisonment. Dustfinger opts not to tell Mo that his wife is in the village and prompts a quick escape using the famous cyclone from The Wizard of Oz. After they escape, Meggie offers the idea that only the author of Inkheart, Fenoglio (Jim Broadbent  may have access to a copy of the rare-to-find book. After learning of the author's location and traveling to his town, Elinor decides to leave to recover what is left of her book collection. Dustfinger stays behind with Farid partly in order to teach him how to juggle fire, but also due to the fact he is afraid of learning his fate at the end of the book. Fenoglio cannot resist approaching his creation and inadvertently blurts out that Dustfinger dies in the novel while saving his marten Gwin. This devastates the fire juggler, who states that the writer is not his god, and he can deem whatever fate he chooses. While Mo attempts to find a way of reading Resa out of the book, Dustfinger has no choice but to confess that she was at Capricorn's village, prompting him and Mo to take Fenoglio's car and leave Meggie behind with Fenoglio. They discover that Farid had stowed away in the car's trunk, and take him along at his insistence. Elsewhere, Elinor has a change of heart and does not take the train back to Italy. Meanwhile, Meggie learns that she has inherited her father's gift when she accidentally summons Toto from The Wizard of Oz. Basta comes and takes Meggie and Fenoglio back to Capricorn's village. Capricorn intends to use Meggie to read the Shadow, Inkheart's supernatural and most deadly villain, out of the book and into the real world, using a copy of the book he had secretly kept to himself. After a brief reunion with her mother, Meggie is coerced into cooperating or risk Capricorn killing Resa. Elinor in the meantime discovers Fenoglio's ransacked apartment and rents a motorbike to save her family. As Mo, Farid and Dustfinger work on a plan of burning down Capricorn's castle, Dustfinger is captured. After escaping his cell, he attempts to free Meggie and Fenoglio who is working on a way to rewrite the ending of the Shadow for her to read. He is unable to free them, and flees, only to return at his conscience  beckoning. Meggie is escorted out to read the Shadow out of the book, and Fenoglio and Resa are caged to be his first meal. Fenoglio manages to use Toto to give her a page that he had written, and she manages to call off the Shadow. In the scuffle, she loses the rewrite and Shadow attempts again to kill Resa, Fenoglio, and Mo, who had intervened in the fight. Mo gives Meggie a pen to write her own ending, and using her arm, Meggie manages to send all the book characters back to their own stories, and at Fenoglio's request, sends him into the Inkheart world as well. Dustfinger misses his chance to return, and departs when Elinor, Resa, Mo and Meggie embrace, where Meggie discovers that Inkheart had been taken. Farid catches up with Dustfinger, insisting on traveling with him to find another reader to send Dustfinger back into the copy of Inkheart that Farid had stolen before the castle collapsed. After a moment's hesitation, Dustfinger agrees, and the two start off together, only to have Mo come up to fulfill his promise to return Dustfinger to his book. Dustfinger is transported safely back into Inkheart, where he reunites with his wife Roxane . Farid reveals to the family that Dustfinger's fate has been changed, as he pulls Gwin out of a travel pack he is carrying, and without the marten to sacrifice himself for, Dustfinger is again in control of his destiny. Meggie and Resa invite Farid to live with them, and Meggie agrees to teach him how to read and Farid agrees to teach her how to use the dragon fire.book fairy tale eavesdropping writer's block",False,tt0494238,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,57490374,1,0,-0.04365297745323417,-1.6278585820155915,23121403.3,64600203.3,,,,,-3548372.0,10,6451628.0,1.0,116841470.0,4.0,189341470.0,2.0,12812485.0,2.0,89812485.0,2.0,97489822.0,3.0,122489822.0,1.0,3112975.3333333335,10.0,19446308.666666668,3.0,96361631.08333333,16.0,134645425.91666666,12.0,68265216.8,27.0,89425216.8,5.0,2030712.0,0.0,2260712.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2315140.0,50315140.0,1.0,103530093.25,221030093.25,4.0,9376156.142857144,55090441.85714286,7.0,,,,,,,,,,76701236.5,112076236.5,4.0,29532978.0,42032978.0,2.0,47723973.5,67223973.5,2.0,192234864.0,372234864.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,240255737.4,299805737.4,10.0,,,,,,,,,81734133.54791667,49170742.52708333,9.0,3.375,95612307.5388973

Matt is obsessed with his ex-girlfriend, Nicole , who has just gotten engaged. He confides to his brother, John , who is training to become a Catholic priest, that he has sexual problems because of his obsession. Matt vows to go without sexual activities for 40 days and 40 nights for Lent. In this movie it is also implied that Matt does not masturbate or otherwise actively seek orgasm for the same period, since doing so could be considered sexual. John warns Matt that celibacy is not easy; meanwhile, Ryan starts a popular office pool to bet on how long Matt can last. Matt meets Erica , a cyber nanny, and begin to date. They face many challenges in their relationship, including her discovery of his celibacy vow and Matt's continuing feelings for Nicole. Matt's co-workers make many unsuccessful attempts to persuade him to have sex in order to win the pool, and as the days pass Matt's obsession with sex grows. At one point he angrily grabs a pornographic magazine from an office desk and begins to march towards a toilet stall in order to masturbate, but his co-workers stop him and convince him to maintain his pledge. Despite the range of increasingly powerful cultural incentives to sex and orgasm surrounding Matt — scantily-dressed women, billboards, et cetera — Matt's commitment holds, and begins to frustrate a lot of the people around him who had fully expected him to break it long before he could get close to his goal. In the meantime, Erica and Matt are falling in love, and they plan a special encounter for the 40th night to celebrate him successfully completing his vow. On the 40th day, a newly single Nicole learns of the betting pool, makes a large bet and then rapes Matt while he is asleep. Erica subsequently believes Matt dishonored his vow and was unfaithful to her, but Matt wins Erica back by reminding her of the special moments they shared during their relationship. The two reconcile in Matt's bedroom for many hours, with his co-workers making a new betting pool on the duration of their stamina.sex addiction laundromat",False,tt0243736,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,95092667,0,0,4.593686294117647,0.06660377319308829,73584248.25,95184709.75,68779415.5263158,105489941.84210527,95537308.75,111549642.08333333,80989651.0,1,172989651.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,102794640.0,128966640.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,172989651.0,80989651.0,0.125,1.0,95886927.05495417

The teenagers featured on the show attend Tracy and Penny's school, among them the arrogant and wealthy Amber von Tussle and her boyfriend, Link Larkin, the lead male dancer. Amber’s mother, Velma, manages WYZT and makes sure Amber is featured and that The Corny Collins Show remains a racially segregated program. Corny Collins and his Council Members are white; black kids are only allowed on the show on ""Negro Day"", held the last Tuesday of each month and hosted by R&B disc jockey Motormouth Maybelle, who owns the local record shop. Tracy's reclusive mother, Edna, and Penny's strict, religious mother, Prudy, disapprove of their daughters' fascination with the program, despite the fact that Prudy watches the show herself; Tracy's father, Wilbur, a joke-shop proprietor, is more lenient. Corny Collins announces that one of the Council Members, Brenda, is pregnant, and is going on a leave of absence, so auditions for a replacement will be held during school hours the next day . When Tracy attends, Velma rejects her for being overweight and supporting integration ("". Tracy is sent to detention by Miss Wimsey for skipping school, discovering the ""Negro Day"" kids practicing their dances in the detention hall. Tracy befriends the students' best dancer, Motormouth Maybelle's son, Seaweed, who teaches Tracy several dance moves. As Tracy leaves detention, she inadvertently bumps into Link and dreams of a life with him . At a record hop, Tracy’s moves attract the attention of Corny Collins  and he appoints her to the Council (""The Nicest Kids in Town . Tracy becomes one of Corny's most popular Council Members. This, however, threatens Amber's chances of winning the show's yearly ""Miss Teenage Hairspray"" pageant  and her relationship with Link, as he grows fonder of Tracy. Mr. Pinky, a slightly off-centered salesman, suggests that Tracy be the spokesgirl for his Hefty Hideaway boutique. Tracy persuades Edna to accompany her to the Hefty Hideaway as her agent, and in the process helps cure her mother's agoraphobia . Tracy introduces Seaweed to Penny, and the two are smitten. One afternoon, Amber has Tracy sent to detention. Link follows after taunting their teacher Mr. Flak. Seaweed invites the girls and Link to follow him and his sister Little Inez to a platter party at Motormouth Maybelle's store . Edna finds Tracy and tries to take her home, until Maybelle convinces her to stay and tells her to take pride in herself . Maybelle informs everyone that Velma has canceled ""Negro Day"". Tracy suggests that Maybelle and the others stage a demonstration for the next afternoon, a day before the ""Miss Teenage Hairspray"" pageant. Realizing that he has a chance at stardom by singing at the pageant, Link does not attend the demonstration. After the party, Edna goes to Wilbur's shop to flirt with him, but Velma gets there first and tries to seduce Wilbur (""Big, Blonde and Beautiful . Edna arrives and accuses Wilbur of infidelity. Edna, out of hatred for Velma, forbids Tracy from being on the show. Wilbur and Edna reconcile ("". The next morning, Tracy sneaks out of the house to join the protest , which comes to a halt at a police roadblock set up by Velma. The protesters are arrested, but Tracy runs to the Pingletons, where Penny hides her in a fallout shelter. Prudy catches Tracy and calls the police before tying Penny to her bed. Seaweed and his friends, having been bailed out by Wilbur, help Tracy and Penny escape. Link visits Tracy’s house to look for her and realizes that he loves her. Seaweed and Penny acknowledge their love during the escape from her house . With the pageant underway ("", Velma places police officers around WYZT to stop Tracy. She also changes the pageant tallies so Amber is guaranteed to win. Penny arrives at the pageant with Edna incognito, while Wilbur, Seaweed and the Negro Day kids help Tracy infiltrate the studio to participate in the Miss Teenage Hairspray contest. Link breaks away from Amber to dance with Tracy; later, he pulls Little Inez, who has arrived at WYZT with Maybelle, to the stage to dance in the pageant. Little Inez receives the most votes and wins the pageant, officially integrating The Corny Collins Show. Velma declares her frustration, informing her daughter of the tally-switching scheme. Edna and Wilbur have turned a camera on her, and Velma's outburst is broadcast on the air, causing her to be dismissed.

She wishes to be a writer, to the dismay of her mother and proud delight of her father. Thomas Lefroy  is a promising lawyer with a bad reputation, which he describes as ""typical"" for people in the profession. Tom makes a bad first impression upon meeting Jane, when he nearly falls asleep while she gives a reading of her work for the company. Overhearing his subsequent criticism, Jane cannot stand the arrogant Irishman. Meanwhile she turns down the affections of other men, including Mr. Wisley , the nephew and heir of the wealthy Lady Gresham . Wisley proposes, but Jane ultimately rejects him due to lack of affection. The mischievous Tom encounters Jane again; they argue, but increasingly take interest in each other, and Tom demonstrates that he takes Jane's literary aspirations seriously. In time they fall in love. Tom, Jane, her brother Henry ([[Joe Anderson , and Jane's rich widowed cousin, Eliza, Comtesse de Feullide , conspire to receive an invitation from Tom's uncle and benefactor, the Lord Chief Judge Langlois of London,  for the rich ""Madame La Comtesse"" and her friends. This visit is meant to be a short break in their journey to see Jane's brother, Edward. This would allow Judge Langlois to get to know Jane before and give a blessing for their marriage. Full of hope, Jane cannot sleep during the night at the Judge's place. In a flow of inspiration, she then begins the writing of First Impressions, the manuscript that will become Pride and Prejudice. However, Judge Langlois receives a letter informing him of the genteel poverty of Jane's family, and he refuses to give Tom his blessing, declaring that he would wish Tom to be the whoremonger he had been rather than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage. Tom tells Jane that he cannot marry her, and she is crushed, not knowing that Tom has a legitimate reason; his family depends on him financially. Jane goes back home and soon learns that Tom has become engaged to someone else at the arrangement of his family. Jane accepts the marriage proposal of Mr. Wisley, whom she had earlier turned down. Later, Tom realises he cannot live without Jane, and returns, asking Jane to run away with him, for ""what value will there be in life, if we are not together?"" Jane agrees, and they leave, with only Jane's sister Cassandra  knowing they plan to marry in secret. On the way, Jane stumbles upon a letter from Tom's mother, and realises his situation: he sends money he receives from his uncle back to his parents and siblings, and his family cannot survive without it. She tells Tom that they cannot elope, not with so many people depending upon him. He insists that he and Jane must marry and tells her he will earn money, but Jane tells him that it will not be enough; he will never be able to make enough money to support his dependents with a High Court judge  as an enemy and with a penniless wife. Distraught, Tom asks her if she loves him, and she replies, “Yes, but if our love destroys your family, then it will destroy itself, in a long, slow degradation of guilt and regret and blame."" She leaves to go home. Jane catches a last glimpse of Tom through the carriage window as he briefly follows, the horses outpacing him. Twenty years later, Jane, now a successful author and by choice unmarried, sees Tom pass by during a gathering. Her brother Henry, now married to Eliza, goes after Tom and brings him to her. Tom introduces his eldest daughter , who admires Jane's novels. As she asks Jane to read aloud, he remonstrates her by her name, also Jane. Astonished that he named his eldest after her, Jane agrees to read. The last scene shows Tom's daughter sitting by Jane as she reads aloud from Pride and Prejudice, while Tom watches Jane affectionately. As she concludes, their eyes meet, and Tom joins the rest of the company in honouring Jane and her work with applause.england judge new love empowerment country life future letter law lovers sister author ireland family",False,tt0416508,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,37311672,1,0,1.2613134545454543,-6.117028646878049,,,,,,,-6024216.5,5,14475783.5,2.0,155927340.5,3.0,213927340.5,4.0,95411161.0,7.0,102911161.0,2.0,108384128.0,1.0,123384128.0,1.0,159965472.83333334,22.0,188160306.16666666,6.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,-1392513.3333333333,4451711.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-49867.0,9950133.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-4370791.25,8129208.75,4.0,,,,,,,,,,-49867.0,9950133.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,128571743.83333333,102732777.16666667,4.75,3.0,105980128.20199434

He meets Natasha, a Russian countess , in Hong Kong after she sneaks aboard to escape being forced into prostitution. She has no passport and is forced to stay in his cabin during the voyage. Ogden dislikes the situation, being a married man, although partially separated, and worries how it might affect his career if she is found. But he reluctantly agrees to let her stay. They then have to figure out a way to get her off the ship, and it is arranged that she marry his aged valet, Hudson . Although it is only a formality, Hudson wishes to consummate the relationship, which a wish she does not share. Natasha avoids him and, before docking at port, jumps off the ship and swims ashore. Ogden's wife  then joins the cruise, having just missed her. Ogden's lawyer friend Harvey , who helped arrange the marriage, meets Natasha and tells her that the immigration officers have accepted her as Hudson's wife. Ogden's wife then confronts him about Natasha, speaking rather roughly about her and the life she led. He then asks if his wife would have done as well under such circumstances.

He lives with his long-time housemaid, Hanna, who loyally cares for him but disapproves of his homosexuality. Whale has suffered a series of strokes that have left him fragile and tormented by memories: growing up as a poor outcast, his tragic World War I service, and the filming of The Bride of Frankenstein. Whale slips into his past, and indulges in his fantasies, reminiscing about gay pool parties and also tormenting a starstruck fan who comes to interview him. Whale battles depression, at times contemplating suicide, as he realizes his life, his attractiveness, and his health are slipping away. Whale befriends his young, handsome gardener and former Marine, Clayton Boone and the two begin a sometimes uneasy friendship as Boone poses for Whale's sketches. The two men bond while discussing their lives and dealing with Whale's spells of disorientation and weakness from the strokes. Boone, impressed with Whale's fame, watches The Bride of Frankenstein on TV as his friends mock the movie, his friendship with Whale, and Whale's intentions. Boone assures Whale that he is straight and receives assurance from Whale that there is no sexual interest, but Boone storms out when Whale graphically discusses his sexual history. Boone later returns with the agreement that no such ""locker room"" discussions occur again. Boone is invited to escort Whale to a party hosted by George Cukor for Princess Margaret. There, a photo op has been arranged for Whale with ""his Monsters"": Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester from ""ancient"" movie fame. This event exacerbates his depression. A sudden rain storm becomes an excuse to leave. Back at Whale's home, Boone needs a dry change of clothes. Whale can only find a sweater, so Boone wears a towel wrapped around his waist. Whale decides to try to sketch Boone one more time. After some minutes, he shows his sketches to Boone, disclosing that he has lost his ability to draw. Boone drops his towel to pose nude. Whale uses the opportunity to make a sexual advance on Boone. Boone becomes enraged and attacks Whale, who confesses that this had been his plan and begs Boone to kill him to relieve him of his suffering. Boone refuses, puts Whale to bed, then sleeps downstairs. The next morning, Hanna is alarmed when she can't find Whale, prompting a search by Boone and Hanna. Boone finds Whale floating dead in the pool, as a distraught Hanna runs out clutching a suicide note. Boone and Hanna agree that Boone should disappear from the scene to avoid a scandal. The film closes roughly a decade later as Boone and his young son, Michael, watch The Bride of Frankenstein on television. The son is skeptical of the claim that his father knew Whale, but Clayton produces a sketch of the Frankenstein monster drawn by Whale, and signed, ""To Clayton. Friend?"" ""Friend?"", being a plea from the original misfit, Frankenstein's monster, and disclosing Whale's true intentions.gay movie business dying and death biography homosexuality author gardener 1950s film director",False,tt0120684,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,6451628,1,0,-0.5499963730084871,-2.5293608277783246,,,,,,,-3669454.5,15,3930545.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9090735.0,12090735.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3930545.5,-3669454.5,1.875,2.0,60772021.118274406

Tramell takes the man's hand and begins masturbating with it, all the while increasing her vehicle's speed. At the point of orgasm, Tramell veers off the road and crashes into the West India Docks in Canary Wharf. She attempts to save her partner but, as she says while being questioned by the police, ""When it came down to it, I guess my life was more important to me than his."" Tramell is interrogated by Detective Supt. Roy Washburn  of Scotland Yard. He notes that D-Tubocurarine, a neuromuscular blocking agent used to relax muscles during general anesthesia, was found in her car and in her companion's body, and the companion wasn't breathing at the time of the crash, and that a man named ""Dicky Pep"" said that he sold Tramell ""15 milliliters of DTC last Thursday."" Tramell counters by saying that this Dicky Pep must be lying because ""you’ve got him on some other charge and he's trying to deal his way out, if he even exists."" Tramell begins therapy sessions with Dr. Michael Glass , who has conducted a court-ordered psychiatric exam and given testimony in her case. Dr. Glass strongly suspects that Catherine is a sociopath incapable of telling the difference between right and wrong. Tramell begins to play mind games with Dr. Glass, who becomes increasingly frustrated with, yet intrigued by, this mysterious woman. Soon, Dr. Glass's own life begins a spiral of destruction. One night, Dr. Glass goes on a date with Michelle Broadwin , and has rough, violent sex with her after dealings with Tramell. Dr. Glass receives a phone call from his ex-wife, Denise , in a state of distress. Her partner, Adam Towers, a journalist writing a negative story about Dr. Glass, has been found strangled to death. Dr. Glass suspects that Tramell committed the murder and is attempting to frame him for it. More murders begin to surface around Dr. Glass as his obsession with Tramell grows and his career and life are threatened – he finds his ex-wife in a bathroom with her throat slit after they have an altercation in a bar. Later the aforementioned Dicky Pep is killed – eventually, he himself can no longer tell right from wrong, and the police begin to suspect Dr. Glass of involvement in the crimes. The situations comes to a head during a confrontation between Dr. Glass and Tramell at her apartment where, after a struggle, Dr. Glass attempts to kill Tramell. Tramell gives Dr. Glass a copy of the draft of her next novel, titled The Analyst. After reading it, he realizes that Catherine has novelized most of the recent events with herself and other people related to Dr. Glass, even himself, as characters. Then it turns out that the character based on herself is going to kill a therapist based on Dr. Glass's colleague, Dr. Gardosh . Glass runs to Gardosh's apartment to warn her, finding Tramell there to his dismay. Gardosh tells him that he is not in charge with Tramell's therapy anymore and that he's going to have his license revoked, due to bad practice regarding Tramell's treatment. There is a struggle between Glass and Gardosh, in which the latter is knocked out. Catherine then threatens Glass with a gun she carries, but Glass takes it away from her. When Washburn arrives at the scene, Glass shoots him because Tramell told him he had killed the girlfriend of one of Glass's patients just to ""nail him"". In the final scene, Tramell pays a visit to Glass at a local mental hospital where he has been institutionalized, and he learns from her that the subject of her latest best-selling novel was a man very much like him. Tramell claims that she manipulated Glass into committing all those murders for her own amusement, and flashbacks are shown of Dr. Glass committing the murders. Tramell leaves with a wicked smirk on her face, while Glass continues to sit silently in his wheelchair, stymied by frustration and rage.sex legs soho london playing god jacuzzi",False,tt0430912,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,38629478,0,0,-0.8120876497476875,-3.847336948521819,235000000.0,435000000.0,16252031.833333334,66963087.916666664,,,-9070394.0,7,929606.0,1.0,,0.0,,,5745315.666666667,5.0,55678649.0,3.0,659804554.0,2.0,789804554.0,1.0,,0.0,,,1109095.0,10.0,4109095.0,1.0,,0.0,,,39978312.0,2.0,115478312.0,2.0,170248826.0,242748826.0,2.0,44535060.75,49872560.75,4.0,,,,,,,-3550677.5,6949322.5,2.0,102867207.5,190367207.5,2.0,3596911.0,31596911.0,1.0,126047099.5,143547099.5,2.0,261305811.66666666,297472478.3333333,3.0,2467327.0,3000000.0,1.0,235000000.0,435000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,-11827302.0,28172698.0,2.0,222500000.0,262500000.0,1.0,,,,45525349.0,64775349.0,2.0,,,,222500000.0,262500000.0,1.0,45908436.333333336,83241769.66666667,3.0,87450043.8,117350043.8,5.0,-3611233.0,27388767.0,1.0,-2389127.0,27610873.0,1.0,,,,,,,257527166.0,336127166.0,5.0,,,193200043.2,139513376.53333333,3.25,1.6,92887866.92008553

The widow , disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to her only son. As a teenager, Barry falls in love with his older cousin, Nora Brady . Though she seduces him, she later drops Barry  for the well-off English Captain John Quin . Nora and her family plan to relieve their poverty with an advantageous marriage, but Barry refuses to accept the situation and shoots Quin in a duel. Barry flees to Dublin, but en route is robbed of purse and equipment by Captain Feeney , a famous highwayman. Broke, Barry joins the British army, whereupon he reunites with Captain Grogan , a family friend, who informs him that, in fact, he did not kill Quin — Barry's dueling pistol was loaded with tow. The duel was staged by Nora's family to get rid of Barry so that their family finances would be secured through the marriage of Nora and Quin. Barry's regiment is sent to France to fight in the Seven Years' War, where Captain Grogan is fatally wounded by the French at the Battle of Minden. Barry deserts the army, stealing an officer courier's uniform, horse, and identification papers. En route to neutral Holland he encounters the Prussian Captain Potzdorf , who, seeing through his disguise, offers him the choice of being turned back over to the British where he will be shot as a deserter, or enlisting in the Prussian army. Barry enlists in his second army and later receives a special commendation from Frederick the Great for saving Potzdorf's life in a battle. After the war ends in 1763, Barry is employed by Captain Potzdorf's uncle in the Prussian Ministry of Police to become the servant of the Chevalier de Balibari ([[Patrick Magee , a professional gambler. The Prussians suspect he is a spy and send Barry as an undercover agent to verify this. Barry reveals himself to the Chevalier right away and they become confederates cheating at cards. After he and the Chevalier cheat the Prince of Tübingen at the cardtable, the Prince accuses the Chevalier  and refuses to pay his debt unless the Chevalier demands satisfaction. When Barry relays this to his Prussian handlers, they  are wary of allowing another meeting between the Chevalier and the Prince. So, the Prussians arrange for the Chevalier to be expelled from the country. Barry conveys this plan to the Chevalier, who flees in the night. The next morning, Barry, under disguise as the Chevalier, is escorted from Prussian territory by Prussian officers. For the next few years, Barry and the Chevalier travel the spas and parlors of Europe, profiting from their gambling with Barry enforcing reluctant debtors with a duel. Seeing that his life is going nowhere, Barry decides to marry into wealth. At a gambling table in Belgium, he encounters the beautiful and wealthy Countess of Lyndon . He seduces and later marries her after the death of her elderly husband, Sir Charles Lyndon . <div styleAct IIEpilogue :It was in the reign of King George III that the aforesaid personages lived and quarreled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal nowbased on novel or book palace british army fencing epic debt ireland british soldier 18th century seven years war nobility prussia",False,tt0072684,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,20000000,0,0,0.8181818181818182,44.936812380342076,16014636.0,18014636.0,,,24389000.0,26589000.0,,0,,,,0.0,,,14444500.0,11.0,17294500.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23994818.0,28494818.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,29576424.0,34909757.333333336,3.0,,,,,,,24389000.0,26589000.0,1.0,,,,24389000.0,26589000.0,1.0,24389000.0,26589000.0,1.0,23994818.0,28494818.0,4.0,,,,89211887.66666667,93786887.66666667,6.0,,,,,,,,,,24389000.0,26589000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,17294500.0,14444500.0,1.375,2.0,65707483.04837625

Edward R. Murrow  and his dedicated staff—headed by his co-producer Fred Friendly  and reporter Joseph Wershba  in the CBS newsroom—defy corporate and sponsorship pressures, and discredit the tactics used by Joseph McCarthy during his crusade to root out Communist elements within the government. Murrow first defends Milo Radulovich, who is facing separation from the U.S. Air Force because of his sister's political leanings and because his father is subscribed to a Serbian newspaper. Murrow makes a show on McCarthy attacking him. A very public feud develops when McCarthy responds by accusing Murrow of being a communist. Murrow is accused of having been a member of the leftist union Industrial Workers of the World, which Murrow claimed was false. In this climate of fear and reprisal, the CBS crew carries on and their tenacity ultimately strikes a historic blow against McCarthy. Historical footage also shows the questioning of Annie Lee Moss, a Pentagon communication worker accused of being a communist based on her name appearing on a list seen by an FBI infiltrator of the American Communist Party. The film's subplots feature Joseph and Shirley Wershba, recently married staffers, having to hide their marriage to save their jobs at CBS as well as the suicide of Don Hollenbeck  who had been accused in print of being a Communist. The film is framed by performance of the speech given by Murrow to the Radio and Television News Directors Association in 1958, in which Murrow harshly admonishes his audience not to squander the potential of television to inform and educate the public.Edward R.

Her father, a Delftware painter, has recently gone blind, rendering him unable to work and putting his family in a precarious financial situation. Consequently, Griet is sent to work as a maid in the unhappy household of the painter Johannes Vermeer . Griet works hard, almost wordlessly, in the lowest position in a harsh hierarchy, where even one of the Vermeer's children treats her spitefully. On a routine shopping trip outside the house, a butcher's son, Pieter , is quickly taken with Griet, though she is slow to return his affections. As Griet cleans Vermeer's studio, which his wife Catharina  never enters, they become casually acquainted and he encourages her appreciation of painting, light and color. Vermeer gives her lessons in mixing paints and other tasks, taking care to keep this secret from his thin-lipped wife, who would react very jealously if she found out that her husband was spending time with Griet. In contrast, Vermeer's pragmatic mother-in-law, Maria Thins , sees Griet as useful to Vermeer's career. Vermeer's rich patron Van Ruijven  notices Griet on a visit to the Vermeer household and asks the painter if he will give her up to him to work in his own house, a situation which ruined a previous girl. Vermeer refuses, but accepts a commission to paint a portrait of Griet for Van Ruijven. As Vermeer secretly works on the eponymous painting, Catharina's growing jealousy of Griet becomes apparent. While Griet suffers through her fascination with Vermeer and his paintings, she also has to fend off Van Ruijven's attempt to rape her. Soon afterwards, Catharina's mother summons Griet, hands over her daughter's pearl earrings and instructs Griet to finish the painting while Catharina is away for the day. At the final painting session Vermeer pierces Griet's earlobe so she can wear one of the pearl earrings for the portrait, in the process sexually arousing Griet, who then runs to Pieter to be consoled. In the aftermath, Pieter proposes marriage, but she sadly turns him down. She then returns the earrings to Catharina's mother. Catharina discovers that Griet used her earrings, accusing her mother of complicity and orders Vermeer to show her the painting he and Griet have been working on. Heartbroken that Vermeer does not consider her worthy of being painted because she ""doesn't understand,"" Catharina tries but fails to destroy the painting, then banishes Griet from the house forever. Vermeer does not object, and Griet leaves the house in shock. Later, Griet is visited by the cook from the house, who comes bearing a gift: a sealed packet containing the blue headscarf she wore in the painting, which is wrapped around Catharina's pearl earrings.painter based on novel or book butcher biography painting holland maid earring 17th century",True,tt0335119,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,43274797,0,0,2.606233083333333,-14.415123713336484,,,,,,,3261608.0,2,8761608.0,1.0,153534115.83333334,14.0,176200782.5,6.0,123948358.0,8.0,138348358.0,5.0,38788091.5,1.0,43788091.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-6595000.0,405000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,91774710.0,79883043.33333334,3.125,3.5,79569518.43496008

He is a longshoreman, hoping to be a cashier; she wants to be an actress. Frank later secures a sales position with the same company at which his father worked and he and April marry. In 1955, the Wheelers move to 115 Revolutionary Road in suburban Connecticut when April becomes pregnant. Frank and April settle into the normality of suburban life while raising their children, Michael and Jennifer. The couple become close friends with their realtor Helen Givings  and her husband Howard Givings , and neighbor Milly Campbell  and her husband Shep . To their friends the Wheelers are the perfect couple, but their relationship is troubled. April fails to make a career out of acting, while Frank hates the tedium of his work. April wants new scenery and a chance to support the family so that Frank can find his passion. April recalls how Frank talked about moving back to Paris. With a failed career, she believes that Paris is the solution to their problems. She suggests they relocate. Initially Frank laughs off the idea, but then begins considering it. The only person who understands the Wheelers' decision is John ([[Michael Shannon , Helen's troubled son. Frank admits to John that they indeed are running away from the ""hopeless emptiness"" of their repetitive lifestyle. As the couple prepares to move, they are forced to reconsider. Frank, propelled by a carefree attitude brought on by the thought of Paris, turns in a sarcastic piece of work to his boss. To his surprise, his work is considered brilliant by company executives and he is offered a promotion. April becomes pregnant again. Frank discovers that April is contemplating having an abortion. He is furious and starts screaming at April, leading to a serious altercation. April is desperate to move to Paris, but Frank is disgusted by the thought of abortion, causing him to feel that moving to Paris is an unrealistic dream. The next day Frank takes the promotion and tries to accept his uneventful life. At the end of an evening at a jazz bar with Milly and Shep, a car blocks in one of the cars the couples came in. April suggests that Frank and Milly head home to release the babysitters at each house while she and Shep wait for the blocking car's driver to return. They re-enter the jazz bar, eventually dancing feverishly with each other, then making love in the car. Shep professes his long-held love for April, but she rejects his interest. The following morning, Frank cheerfully admits to having an affair with an assistant at his office, hoping to reconcile with April. April responds apathetically and tells him it does not matter and her love for him has gone. The Givings come over for dinner, and John lambasts Frank for crushing April's hope, as well as his acceptance of his circumstances, accusing Frank of getting April pregnant specifically to destroy the idea of moving to Paris, and saying that April allowed him to do it so that she would feel her husband was ""a real man"". Frank gets angry, nearly attacks John and the Givings hurry out. April and Frank have another fight, which causes April to flee the house. Frank spends the night in a drunken stupor, but is shocked to find April in the kitchen calmly making breakfast the next morning. The couple have a pleasant breakfast, with April asking Frank about work and Frank seeming enthusiastic as he describes how the large computer purchase he is making will help many businesses. April's mood seems to have improved, but after bidding good-bye to Frank she breaks down and prepares to perform her own vacuum aspiration abortion, which proves fatal. Shep goes to the hospital to support Frank, who hysterically tells him that ""she did it to herself"" but is grief-stricken when he hears of April's demise. A new couple buys the house and we hear Milly telling the story of the Wheelers to the new owners, telling them how Frank moved to the city and is still working with computers, devoting every spare moment of his life to his children. Shep quietly tells Milly that he doesn't want to talk about the Wheelers anymore. Helen tells Howard that she thinks the new couple that moved in are the first people she has ever found suitable for the home. Howard asks why she does not give credit to the Wheelers, and she says they were too whimsical, trying and neurotic. As she continues discussing what she did not like about the Wheelers, Howard turns off his hearing aid.adultery based on novel or book jealousy husband wife relationship infidelity american dream housewife career marriage crisis connecticut suburbia free spirit unhappiness getaway aspiring actor 1950s unhappy marriage feeling trapped bleak",False,tt0959337,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,75225693,0,0,1.1493055142857145,-1.6278585820155915,75827049.0,100827049.0,8983216.11764706,23186731.94117647,,,98435291.0,10,146768624.33333334,3.0,34863296.11111111,13.0,75863296.1111111,9.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,386090727.0,0.0,586090727.0,1.0,-25982016.0,10.0,39017984.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36968754.333333336,116302087.66666667,3.0,,,,37528173.0,87528173.0,1.0,,,,6000781.5,15500781.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,166465037.0,266465037.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,126720069.0,163720069.0,1.0,14332988.625,32082988.625,8.0,,,,,,,,,211935157.8611111,123351824.52777778,4.125,3.5,95612307.5388973

Jackie wants her fiancé, Simon Doyle , to work for Linnet. But he and Linnet have a whirlwind affair and end up marrying. While honeymooning in Egypt, they are continually hounded by a jilted Jackie. In an attempt to get away, the Doyles board a Nile paddle steamer, the S.S. Karnak. When the passengers venture off-shore to examine a nearby temple, a large stone is pushed off a pillar and narrowly misses Simon and Linnet. They again encounter Jackie, who boards the ship and ignores the warnings of detective Hercule Poirot  to stay away, revealing that she carries a small pistol. After a late-night game of cards in the ship's lounge, Jackie confronts Simon. She shoots him in a drunken rage and hits him in the leg. The next morning, Linnet Ridgeway is discovered murdered in her cabin, shot in the head by a similar weapon, with almost everyone aboard the S.S. Karnak having had a reason to want to do away with the heiress. The pistol has meanwhile gone missing.  * The elderly Mrs. van Schuyler  coveted Linnet's jewels. * Miss Bowers , was forced into a life of servitude when Linnet’s father destroyed her family. * The maid, Louise Bourget , was upset because Linnet refused her a promised dowry. * James Ferguson , a Communist, resented Linnet's life of luxury. * Eccentric novelist Salome Otterbourne  faced a libel suit brought by Linnet . * The author's daughter Rosalie  wanted to protect her mother. * American lawyer Andrew Pennington  had embezzled from the Ridgeway family. * Dr. Ludwig Bessner  was upset because Linnet made defamatory remarks about his clinic. * Jacqueline de Bellefort was upset with Linnet for obvious reasons. Poirot admits he found out all this by being a ""nasty eavesdropper."" Now it’s up to the Belgian sleuth, along with his vacationing friend Colonel Race , who was representing Linnet's British lawyers and investigating Pennington, to solve the mystery.  Jackie is a natural suspect but has a perfect alibi, having been sedated and observed by Miss Bowers all night. Simon Doyle was also unable to commit the crime due to his leg wound. Poirot is convinced someone on deck overheard the argument, removed the gun and used it to kill Linnet. A bundle had been found in the Nile. The missing pistol is wrapped in Mrs. van Schuyler's stole, which was apparently used to muffle the sound of a gunshot and prevent scorching, as seen around Linnet's injury. A handkerchief was also included, stained with red ink, some of which was found in Linnet's pearl nail-varnish bottle. While Poirot and Race conduct their investigation, the maid Louise is murdered. Her throat has been cut with one of Dr. Bessner's scalpels and a fragment of a banknote is found in her hand. Poirot realizes she probably saw the murderer coming out of Linnet's cabin and attempted to extort money in return for her silence. Salome Otterbourne claims to have seen Louise's murderer and is about to tell Poirot when she is shot in the head through an open cabin door with Pennington's revolver, too large to have been used on Linnet.  With several suspects eliminated, Poirot gathers everyone in the saloon, where he reveals the solution — Simon Doyle murdered his wife, with Jacqueline as his accomplice. Poirot reveals that Simon and Jackie were still lovers, and his marriage to Linnet had been cleverly plotted in order to gain her money. They faked Simon's shooting, leaving him free to murder Linnet while the doctor was being fetched by Ferguson and as Jacqueline was attended to by Miss Bowers. Simon was left alone long enough to run to Linnet's room, shoot her in the head, return to the lounge and shoot himself in the leg through the stole - a third shot of which no one was aware. Jackie covered up. She stole the knife and revolver, then killed the maid and Salome Otterbourne. Simon and Jackie point out that Poirot has no proof, so Poirot convinces Simon that his hands could be tested for grains of gunpowder removed with wax. When they realize that they have been found out, they confess, and in a final love embrace, Jackie covertly takes back her pistol and shoots Simon, then herself. Later Poirot says goodbye to the remaining guests, reveals that the test was made-up, and Rosalie and Ferguson announce that they are engaged.based on novel or book egypt paddleboat cruise nile sphinx murder cobra shipboard murder mystery 1930s pyramids hercule poirot",False,tt0077413,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,14560084,0,0,0.8383944444444444,15.1328345263288,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,26322359.0,17.0,35322359.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9100000.0,12600000.0,1.0,111692319.0,112892319.0,1.0,90572000.0,97572000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,-953079.0,46921.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,35322359.0,26322359.0,2.125,2.0,68011965.11413558

As Briony attempts to stage the play with her cousins, they get bored and decide to go swimming. Briony stays behind and witnesses a significant moment of sexual tension between her older sister, Cecilia , and Robbie Turner, a servant's son , a man that Briony has a childish crush on. Robbie returns home and writes several drafts of letters to Cecilia, including one that is explicit and erotically charged. He does not, however, intend to send it and sets it aside. On his way to join the Tallis family celebration, Robbie asks Briony to deliver his letter, only to later realise that he has mistakenly given her the prurient draft. Briony secretly reads the letter and is simultaneously disgusted and jealous. That evening, Cecilia and Robbie meet in the library, where they finally declare their love for one another and make love. During the act, Briony watches through the partially open door and her confused emotions about Robbie become heightened. At dinner it is revealed that the twin cousins have run away. Briony goes off alone into the woods looking for them and stumbles upon a man running away from apparently raping her teenage cousin Lola . Lola claims that she does not know the identity of her attacker, but in a fit of pique the still-wounded Briony tells everyone, including the police, that she saw Robbie commit the act. She shows Robbie's shocking letter to her mother. Everyone believes her story except for Cecilia. Robbie is arrested and sent to prison. Four years later, Robbie is released from prison on condition that he joins the army. He is assigned to A Company, 1st Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment. He is reunited with Cecilia  in London, where they renew their love before he is shipped off to the French front. Briony , now 18, has joined Cecilia's old nursing corps at St. Thomas's in London because she wants to be of some practical use to society and has given up an offer she received from Cambridge. Her attempts at contacting her sister go unanswered, as Cecilia blames her for Robbie's imprisonment. Later, Robbie, wounded and very ill, finally arrives at the beaches of Dunkirk, where he waits to be evacuated. Briony, now fully understanding the impact of her accusation, later visits the now-married Cecilia and Robbie to apologise to them directly. Cecilia coldly replies that she will never forgive her. Robbie, in a rage that almost becomes physical, confronts Briony and demands that she immediately tell her family and the authorities the truth. Briony admits that the rapist was actually family friend Paul Marshall , but that he cannot be implicated in a court of law because he has married Lola. Decades later, an elderly Briony  reveals in an interview that she is dying of vascular dementia, and that her novel, Atonement, which she has been working on for most of her adult life, will be her last. Briony reveals that the book's ending where she apologised to Cecilia and Robbie is fictional. Cecilia and Robbie never saw each other again once he left for war. In reality, Robbie actually died at Dunkirk of septicemia while awaiting evacuation, and Cecilia died a few months later as one of the flood victims in the Balham tube station bombing during The Blitz.

As Longbourn is destined to be inherited by Mr. Bennet's cousin, Mr. Collins, Mrs. Bennet is anxious to marry off her five daughters before Mr. Bennet dies. Wealthy bachelor Charles Bingley has recently moved into Netherfield, a large, nearby estate. He is introduced to local society at an assembly ball, along with his haughty sister Caroline and reserved friend, Mr. Darcy, who ""owns half of Derbyshire."" Bingley is enchanted with the gentle and beautiful Jane, while Elizabeth takes an instant dislike to Darcy after he coldly rebuffs her attempts at conversation and she overhears him insult her. When Jane becomes sick on a visit to Netherfield, Elizabeth goes to stay with her, verbally sparring with Caroline and Darcy. Later the Bennets are visited by Mr. Collins, a pompous clergyman who talks of nothing but his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Collins soon decides to pursue Elizabeth. Meanwhile, the handsome and charming Lieutenant Wickham of the newly-arrived militia captures the girls' attention; he wins Elizabeth's sympathy by telling her that Darcy had cheated him of his inheritance. At a ball at Netherfield, Elizabeth, startled by Darcy's abrupt appearance and request, accepts a dance with him, but vows to her best friend Charlotte Lucas that she has ""sworn to loathe him for all eternity."" During the dance, she attacks him with witty sarcasm and Darcy responds in kind. At the same ball, Charlotte expresses concern to Elizabeth that Jane's behaviour to Mr. Bingley is too reserved and that Bingley may not realise she loves him. The next day, at Longbourn, Collins proposes to Elizabeth, but she declines. When Bingley unexpectedly returns to London, Elizabeth dispatches a heartbroken Jane to the city to stay with their aunt and uncle, the Gardiners, in hopes of re-establishing contact between Jane and Bingley. Later, Elizabeth is appalled to learn that Charlotte will marry Collins to gain financial security and avoid remaining a spinster. Months later, Elizabeth visits the newly-wed Mr. and Mrs. Collins at Rosings, Lady Catherine's manor estate; they are invited to dine there, and meet Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam, whom it transpires are Lady Catherine's nephews. Here Darcy shows greater interest in Elizabeth, especially when she replies to Lady Catherine's jabs with spirited wit. The next day, Colonel Fitzwilliam lets slip to Elizabeth that Darcy had separated Bingley from Jane. Distraught, she flees outside, but Darcy chooses that moment to track her down and propose marriage. He claims that he loves her ""most ardently,"" despite her ""lower rank."" Elizabeth refuses him, citing his treatment of Jane and Bingley and of Wickham; they argue fiercely, with Darcy explaining that he had been convinced that Jane did not return Bingley's love. Darcy leaves angry and heartbroken. He finds Elizabeth later and presents her with a letter, which alleges Wickham is a gambler who demanded and received cash in lieu of the position intended for him by Darcy's father. It is further claimed that upon being refused more money, Wickham had attempted to elope with Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, in order to obtain her £30,000 inheritance, but abandoned her upon learning that he would never receive the money. The Gardiners take Elizabeth on a trip to the Peak District and visit Darcy's estate, Pemberley, believing that he is away travelling. Elizabeth is stunned by its wealth and beauty and hears nothing but good things about Darcy from his housekeeper. There, she accidentally runs into Darcy, who has arrived home early. He invites her and the Gardiners to meet his sister. His manners have softened considerably and Georgiana takes an instant liking to Elizabeth. When Elizabeth learns that her immature and flirtatious youngest sister Lydia has run away with Wickham, she tearfully blurts out the news to Darcy and the Gardiners before returning home. Her family expects social ruin for having a disgraced daughter, but they are soon relieved to hear that Mr. Gardiner had discovered the pair in London and that they had married. Lydia later reveals to Elizabeth that Darcy had found them and had paid for the marriage. When Bingley and Darcy return to Netherfield, Jane accepts Bingley's proposal. The same evening, Lady Catherine unexpectedly visits Elizabeth and insists that she renounce Darcy, as he is supposedly engaged to her own daughter, Anne. Elizabeth refuses and unable to sleep, walks on the moor at dawn. There, she meets Darcy, also unable to sleep after hearing of his aunt's behaviour. He admits his continued love and Elizabeth accepts his proposal. Mr. Bennet gives his consent after Elizabeth assures him of her love for Darcy. In the U.S. release of the film, an additional last scene shows the newlyweds outside of Pemberley showing affection for each other.based on novel or book bachelor prejudice suitor period drama georgian pride 18th century opposites attract",False,tt0414387,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,121147947,1,0,3.3267123928571434,-2.6760407675788414,71057778.5,118557778.5,-6254138.666666667,12079194.666666666,73088151.25806452,109975248.03225806,52227113.0,3,93398832.66666667,3.0,,0.0,,,291971116.0,3.0,431971116.0,1.0,,0.0,,,34680294.0,20.0,68680294.0,3.0,6331980.25,9.0,17456980.25,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,17316267.0,105316267.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,132003917.83333333,157753917.83333334,6.0,,,,94132401.38461539,128198555.23076923,13.0,,,,,,,-2863631.0,4161369.0,4.0,2300000.0,13300000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,152876805.72916666,96302625.8125,4.375,2.75,109858494.28372188

They go to Karlstadt to rid the town of a witch's ghost. After killing the ""ghost"", it is revealed that the Brothers Grimm have actually set up a fake witch to trick the town. Afterwards, as they are celebrating, Italian torturer Cavaldi takes them to the French General Delatombe. Delatombe forces them to solve a mystery: the girls of the small village of Marbaden are disappearing and the villagers are convinced that supernatural beings are responsible. The Grimms are charged with finding who is responsible and they soon discover that it is the work of a real supernatural force: a beautiful, yet dangerous 500-year-old Thuringian queen stealing young girls to restore her own beauty. Will and Jake have a complicated relationship, since Jake is the smaller, younger, more sensitive one that Will feels he needs to protect. Will is often very hard on Jake  and orders him around. Will is somewhat of a womanizer and wants to make money, while Jake is more interested in fairy tales and adventures. Jake feels that Will doesn't care about or believe in him, but Will is just frustrated about the way Jake acts so spontaneously, therefore making it hard for Will to protect him. Long ago, King Childeric I came to the forest to build a city while the queen experimented with black magic to gain eternal life. A plague swept through the land and she hid in her tower, while her husband and everyone below her perished. Her spell granted her immortal life, but not the youth and beauty to go along with it. Her youthful appearance now only exists in her mirror, the source of her life, as an illusion and nothing more. She needs to drink the blood of twelve young girls to regain her beauty; ten have already been reported missing. The queen is working an enchantment to regain her beauty with the aid of her werewolf huntsman and his magic axe, crow familiars, and various creatures in the forest. The Grimms, with the help of Cavaldi and Angelika, a knowing huntress from the village, intend to destroy The Mirror Queen. After another girl goes missing, Cavaldi takes the Grimms and Angelika back to Delatombe. Because they have failed, Cavaldi is ordered to kill both the Grimms, but after convincing Delatombe that the magic in the forest is actually caused by German rebels, he sends them back. While Cavaldi stays behind with Angelika in the village, the brothers attempt to get into the tower. Jake succeeds and discovers the queen and the power of her mirror. Meanwhile, another girl named Sasha is captured despite Angelika and Cavaldi's efforts to save her. Jake rides into the forest alone after a spat with Will, who follows him. After mistaking a dummy that is smashed into the tower for Jake, Will realizes that Jake needs him to believe in him, and assists Jake in climbing up the tower. On the roof of the tower, Jake notices twelve crypts in which the twelve victims must lie. When Sasha's body comes up from a well, the werewolf takes her to a tomb. After rescuing Sasha and taking the werewolf's magic axe, the Grimms return to the village. Delatombe captures the brothers and believes them to be frauds. French soldiers begin burning down the forest and Cavaldi represses his sympathy to the brothers, but they are eventually saved by Angelika. The werewolf is revealed to be Angelika's father, who is under the Queen's spell. It turns out that he is only able to keep on living due to an enchanted spike that is lodged into his chest and without such, the spell is broken. Angelika is drowned by her father, becoming the 12th victim. The Brothers reach the tower while the Queen breathes an ice wind which puts out the forest fire. Delatombe notices that the Grimms have escaped and goes after them with Cavaldi. When Cavaldi refuses to kill the Grimms, Delatombe shoots him, but is later impaled by Will. Will and Jake enter the tower, where Will falls under the Queen's spell by taking the enchanted spike from Angelika's father and lodging it inside of Will instead. Jake shatters the enchanting mirror in the tower, preventing the queen from completing the spell that will restore her youth. With the last of his strength, Angelika's father destroys the rest of the mirror by jumping out of the window with it, and Will, in an attempt to save the queen, tries to take back the mirror and falls with him, and both men are killed. Outside, Cavaldi survives, having donned the Grimm's faux-magic armor. He finds Will's body and recites an Italian curse, and the tower falls apart. Jake escapes, and Cavaldi informs Jake that he can break the spell and awaken Angelika with a kiss, which in turn resurrects the other girls and Will. With the menace gone and their daughters returned to them, the villagers of Marbaden celebrate and give their heart-felt thanks to the brothers. Cavaldi stays in the village and joins the villagers for the feast. Angelika kisses both the Grimms and tells them that they are always welcome at the village. The Grimms decide to pursue a new profession, presumably recording fairy tales although they are now wanted criminals of the state. One of the queen's crows is seen flying off with the last shard of her mirror, still holding the queen's watchful eye, and presumably, her living soul.germany sibling relationship literature brothers grimm con artist aftercreditsstinger 19th century fictionalized history fake exorcism",True,tt0355295,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,105316267,0,0,0.1967757613636364,-2.6760407675788414,101183863.0,171183863.0,,,11702990.5,14377990.5,-5117355.0,3,29882645.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,25148951.666666668,9.0,38415618.333333336,3.0,46438641.6,20.0,88038641.6,5.0,,0.0,,,-14340069.5,6.0,5159930.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,54478416.0,104478416.0,1.0,,,,70510237.5,100510237.5,2.0,-405050.5,16352449.5,4.0,102425936.6,175751936.6,5.0,-2803938.25,17103561.75,4.0,71189493.33333333,95467271.1111111,9.0,,,,,,,-2691316.0,17308684.0,3.0,143210943.0,241525943.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,-9189872.0,12686794.666666666,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-39808601.0,7191399.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,40374208.858333334,13032542.191666666,4.75,2.75,109858494.28372188

The train turns out to be carrying only a fraction of the money originally thought, and Frank James informs Charley Ford that the robbery would be the last the James brothers would commit, and that the gang had ""gave up their nightridin' for good"". Jesse returns home to Kansas City, bringing the Fords, Dick Liddil and his cousin, Wood Hite. Jesse sends Charley, Wood and Dick away, but insists that Bob stay, leading Bob to believe Jesse has taken a shine to him. It transpires that Jesse only required Bob to stay to assist him moving his furniture to a new home. Jesse then allows him to stay with the James family for a few extra days. Bob spends these days obsessing over Jesse, before being sent away to return to his sister's farmhouse and rejoin Wood, Dick and Charley. Dick Liddil reveals to Bob that he is in cahoots with another member of the James gang, Jim Cummins, to capture Jesse for a substantial bounty. Meanwhile, Jesse visits another gang member, Ed Miller, who unwittingly gives away information on Cummins' plot. Jesse kills Miller, then departs with Dick Liddil to hunt down Jim Cummins. Unable to locate Jim, Jesse viciously beats Albert Ford, a young cousin of Bob and Charley. Dick returns to the Bolton's farmhouse, and is involved in a dispute with Wood Hite, ending in Wood's death at the hands of Robert Ford. Hite's body is dumped in the woods, in an effort to conceal this from Jesse. Jesse and Charley Ford travel to St. Joseph, Missouri, and Jesse learns of Wood's disappearance, which Charley denies knowing anything about. Meanwhile, Bob approaches Kansas City police commissioner, Henry Craig, revealing that he has information regarding Jesse James's whereabouts. To prove his allegiance with the James gang, Bob urges Craig to arrest Dick Liddil. Following Dick's arrest, and subsequent confession to his involvement in numerous James gang robberies, Bob brokers a deal with the Governor of Missouri, Thomas T. Crittenden, in which he is given 10 days to capture or kill Jesse James. After being persuaded by Charley, Jesse agrees to take Bob into the gang, and the Ford brothers travel to Jesse's home in St. Joseph, to stay with him, his wife Zee, and their two children. Jesse plans numerous robberies with the Fords, beginning with the Platte City bank. On the morning of 3 April, 1882, Jesse and the Ford brothers prepare to depart for the Platte City robbery. After reading the morning newspaper, Jesse learns of the arrest and confessions of Dick Liddil. The Fords excuse themselves into the living room, and put on their gun holsters. Jesse removes his own gun belt, lest he look suspicious to the neighbours, and climbs a chair to clean a dusty picture. Robert Ford shoots Jesse James in the back of the head, and the Ford brothers flee the James household, sending a telegram to the Governor to announce Jesse's killing. After the assassination, the Fords become celebrities with a theater show in Manhattan, re-enacting the assassination with Bob playing himself, and Charley as Jesse James. Guilt-stricken, Charley pens numerous letters to Zee James asking for her forgiveness, none of which he mails. Overwhelmed with despair and terminally ill from tuberculosis, Charles Ford commits suicide in May 1884. On June 8, 1892, Bob is sought out and murdered by a man named Edward O'Kelley, while working as a saloonkeeper in Creede, Colorado. O'Kelley is later pardoned for the killing.killing admiration hold-up robbery to shoot dead idol missouri media jesse james cowardliness family coward",False,tt0443680,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,14711793,1,0,-1.0391804044551198,-6.117028646878049,2928871.0,18928871.0,78511035.0,132511035.0,195491376.0,298491376.0,141339094.66666666,7,241339094.66666666,3.0,1284514.0,12.0,21284514.0,1.0,54478416.0,2.0,104478416.0,1.0,80989651.0,6.0,172989651.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,24670271.5,3.0,32207296.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18564588.0,34564588.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,114459794.43333334,60552389.43333333,3.75,1.6,105980128.20199434

Seeing Protestant England as a threat, and in retaliation for English piracy of Spanish ships, Philip intends to make war. He plans to take over England, and make his daughter Isabella the Queen of England in Elizabeth's place. In England, Elizabeth  is being pressured to marry by her advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham . She is aging and, with no child, the throne will pass to her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots . The Queen is presented with portraits of appropriate suitors, but Elizabeth refuses to marry, particularly to the Archduke Charles of Austria , who has become infatuated with the Queen. Walter Raleigh  is presented at Elizabeth's court, having returned from the New World, and offers her potatoes, tobacco, two Native Americans, and gold from Spanish ships that he claims were ""unable to continue their journey"". The Spanish ambassador protests. Elizabeth commands that the Native Americans be treated well, and refuses to accept the gold. Elizabeth is attracted to Raleigh, enthralled by his tales of exploration, and asks Elizabeth Throckmorton  , her most favored lady-in-waiting, to observe him. Bess also finds Raleigh attractive and secretly begins an affair with him. Elizabeth meanwhile seeks guidance from her astrologer, Dr. John Dee  who predicts that two empires will go to war. However, he cannot predict which will triumph over the other, leaving Elizabeth to ponder her and England's fate. Jesuits in London conspire with Philip to assassinate Elizabeth and replace her with Mary, in what Philip calls ""The English Enterprise,"" and which is known to history as the Babington Plot. Walsingham discovers the plot. From her imprisonment Mary sends secret correspondence to the Jesuits, who recruit Anthony Babington  to assassinate Elizabeth. Walsingham continues to warn Elizabeth of Spain's rising power and of the Catholic plots against her. However she, unlike her predecessor and sister Mary I, refuses to force her people  to share her beliefs. Even then, those conspiring against Elizabeth are being hunted and murdered, including Bess's cousin, whom Bess had failed to protect. After learning of her cousin's torture and death at Walsingham's hands, Bess turns to Raleigh for comfort. The barely hidden closeness of Bess and Raleigh causes tension between them, testing her desire to keep him in England and increasing his desire to go back to the New World. Walsingham's brother, a Papist, knows of the plot against Elizabeth. It is revealed that Walsingham had known of the plot all along, intercepting letters, and his brother is jailed. He reveals the plot to Elizabeth, who angrily confronts the Spanish diplomats. The Spanish ambassador feigns ignorance and accuses Elizabeth of receiving Spanish gold from pirates and insinuating a sexual relationship with Raleigh. A sword fight nearly ensues between the queen's male escorts and the Spanish contingent. She throws the Spaniards out of court. Meanwhile, Philip is cutting the forests of Spain to build the Spanish Armada to invade England. Mary, Queen of Scots, writes letters condoning the plot. Babington storms into a cathedral where Elizabeth is praying and points a gun at her. Elizabeth opens her arms, seemingly fearless. He pulls the trigger, and the gun fires. At first Walsingham is unable to discern why the gun was harmless, though it is later revealed by the traitor in the torture chamber that there was no bullet in the gun. Elizabeth learns of Mary's involvement, and Walsingham insists she be executed to quell any possible revolt. Elizabeth is reluctant, but nevertheless agrees. Mary is tried for high treason. She is beheaded, ascending the block in a blood-red dress, red being the Catholic liturgical colour for martyrs. Walsingham sees that this was part of the Jesuit's plan all-along. Philip had never intended Mary to become queen. Since the Pope and other Catholic leaders regarded Mary as the true Queen of England, Philip uses Mary's death to obtain papal approval for war. In England, Raleigh asks to leave for the New World, which Elizabeth forbids, instead knighting him and making him Captain of the Royal Guard. Bess discovers she is pregnant with Raleigh's child and, after telling him the news, she pleads with him to leave. He chooses not to, and the couple marry in secret. At the same time, Elizabeth awakes during a dream as the wedding is taking place. She confronts Bess a few weeks later, who confesses that she is indeed pregnant with Raleigh's child, and that Raleigh is her husband. An enraged Elizabeth berates Bess, reminding her that she cannot marry without royal consent. Feeling betrayed, the queen banishes Bess from court and has Raleigh imprisoned for the crime of seducing a ward of the Queen. Walsingham arranges for his brother, William, who is eleven years Francis' junior, to be released and taken to France on the condition that he must never return to England. The Armada begins its approach up the English Channel, and Elizabeth forgives Bess and sets Raleigh free to join Sir Francis Drake in the battle. Elizabeth gives her Speech to the Troops at Tilbury seated on a war horse wearing full plate armour. The Spanish ships and army vastly outnumber England's, but at the last moment, a major storm blows the Armada towards the beaches, endangering their formation and ships. They drop anchor, and the Armada becomes a sitting duck for English fire ships. Elizabeth, back at her coastal headquarters, walks out to the cliffs and watches the Spanish Armada sink in flames. Philip's plan is shattered. Elizabeth visits Walsingham on his deathbed, telling her old friend to rest. She then visits Raleigh and Bess and blesses their child. Elizabeth seemingly triumphs personally through her ordeal, again resigned to her role as the Virgin Queen and mother to the English people.england assassination queen elizabeth i religious war tudors middle ages armada catholicism sea battle palace intrigue 16th century",False,tt0414055,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,74237563,0,0,0.3497738727272727,-6.117028646878049,75836626.975,112249126.975,43284537.0,69962314.77777778,97130015.73913044,120266885.30434783,3171992.5,10,17796992.5,4.0,45240182.0,6.0,104690182.0,4.0,128939335.0,9.0,148189335.0,2.0,20811672.0,0.0,37311672.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,115727804.33333333,8.0,154061137.66666666,3.0,,0.0,,,53106132.0,101856132.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,44279112.0,63279112.0,2.0,-7133970.666666667,17199362.666666668,3.0,-5117355.0,29882645.0,1.0,6699053.0,24699053.0,2.0,395015608.5,473015608.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,-8217802.0,5782198.0,1.0,42664502.0,85164502.0,4.0,62103501.0,114603501.0,2.0,,,,630382293.1666666,747382293.1666666,6.0,3842000.0,25842000.0,1.0,,,,17316267.0,105316267.0,1.0,4954532.5,97454532.5,2.0,-39011519.5,30988480.5,2.0,,,,57081479.28571428,72495765.0,7.0,70306374.0,85306374.0,1.0,128454181.33333333,163454181.33333334,3.0,,,92409863.83333333,62778197.166666664,4.125,2.8,105980128.20199434

His alarming appearance and strange behavior cause his co-workers to keep away; they eventually turn on him after he is involved in a machine accident that causes his colleague Miller  to lose his left arm. Trevor, who was distracted by an unfamiliar co-worker named Ivan , bears the blame for the accident. No one at the factory knows of Ivan and there are no records of him as an employee. Trevor seems to find peace only in the arms of Stevie , a prostitute who develops genuine affection for him, or in the company of Maria , a waitress at the airport diner where he spends many of his sleepless nights. Trevor is haunted by brief flashes of recurring imagery, and everyday objects take on a menacing air, like the car cigarette lighter. A mysterious series of post-it notes that appear on his refrigerator depict a game of hangman; these vaguely threatening incidents send Trevor further into paranoia. He nevertheless attempts to establish a tentative romantic relationship with Maria. Meeting her at an amusement park, Trevor accompanies her son Nicholas on a grotesque funhouse ride called ""Route 666"" whose flashing lights cause the boy to suffer an epileptic seizure. Trevor is no longer able to think clearly and begins to suspect that the bizarre events in his life are a concerted effort to drive him insane. These ideas are fed to him in small random clues. One of them takes the form of a picture of Ivan fishing with Reynolds, one of Trevor's co-workers, which Trevor discovers in Ivan's wallet when it's momentarily left behind in a pub. Another near-accident at work causes Trevor to lash out in rage at his co-workers and as a result he is immediately fired. Growing increasingly distracted and alienated, Trevor forgets to pay his utility bills and his electricity is disconnected. A dark, viscous liquid begins trickling out of the freezer, eventually coating the refrigerator door with streaks of what appears to be blood. After several unsuccessful attempts at confronting Ivan, Trevor tries to trace him through his license plate. He follows Ivan's car to read its license plate just before his gasoline runs out. When a DMV clerk insists that he cannot release personal information unless a crime has been committed, Trevor throws himself in front of a car in order to accuse Ivan of committing a hit and run. After filing a police report with Ivan's plate number on it, the battered Trevor is dumbfounded when the investigator tells him that the car in question is his own; Trevor reported the vehicle destroyed in a wreck one year ago. He runs from the policemen and goes to see Stevie, who clothes and washes him. But then Trevor finds the fishing picture of Ivan and Reynolds now framed in her home and accuses her of conspiring against him. Stevie is confused and says the picture is of Reynolds and him, not Ivan, but Trevor refuses to look at it. Following a short, intense bout of name-calling Trevor is thrown out. He goes to find solace at the airport diner but when he asks about Maria, an unfamiliar waitress tells him they never had an employee there by that name - the waitress says she has served Trevor every day for a year, without him ever saying a word. In the film's climax Trevor sees Ivan take Nicholas, who appears to have been kidnapped, into Trevor's apartment. Fearing the worst, Trevor sneaks inside. Nicholas is nowhere to be seen and does not respond to Trevor's calls. Trevor confronts Ivan in the bathroom, and asks him what he has done with Nicholas. Trevor struggles with and ultimately kills Ivan. He then flings open the shower curtain, expecting to see Nicholas's dead body, but the bathtub is empty. He goes to his refrigerator and opens it to find rotting fish and other spoiled foods tumbling out. His mind then flashes back to the fishing photo, which now shows a heavier, healthier Trevor standing near his co-worker Reynolds, just as Stevie claimed. Ivan was never in the photo; it was all a part of Trevor's hallucination. The scene then returns to one that occurred during the opening credit roll, in which Trevor tries to dispose of someone's corpse , rolling it in a rug and struggling to cast it into the ocean. When the rug unravels, there is nothing inside. Ivan—as alive as ever—appears holding a flashlight and laughing. Trevor, suddenly home again and staring at himself in a mirror, begins to repeat, ""I know who you are."" He then recalls his own role in a hit-and-run accident a year earlier, in which he ran over and killed a boy identical to Nicholas after taking his eyes off the road for a moment to use the car's cigarette lighter. The boy's mother, whom he later fantasizes as Maria the waitress, was at the scene; Trevor decided to drive away. The resulting guilt became the deep-seated cause of his insomnia. He fills in the missing letters for the hangman game on his refrigerator to spell ""killer."" Upon recovering this deeply repressed memory he briefly considers going to the airport and escaping. Instead he drives to police headquarters, accompanied by an encouraging but silent Ivan, who bids him an approving farewell from outside the station. At the police station's front desk Trevor confesses to his hit and run. Two police officers escort Trevor to a cell, where he states that he intends to go to sleep, and proceeds to do so for the first time in a year.factory insomnia post it machinist osha taunting manhole one armed man torment mother's day losing weight old photograph dostoevsky",False,tt0361862,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,8203235,0,0,0.6406470000000001,1.9257596443831189,,,,,,,7525574.0,6,49525574.0,3.0,-18602569.5,10.0,8897430.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-14443660.0,13.0,15556340.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,5858355.0,10158355.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24659781.5,-8506885.166666666,3.625,2.0,84824632.31357588

John and his greedy, snobbish wife Fanny  immediately install themselves in the large house; Fanny invites her brother Edward Ferrars  to stay with them. She frets about the budding friendship between Edward and Elinor and does everything she can to prevent it from developing. Sir John Middleton , a cousin of the widowed Mrs. Dashwood , offers her a small cottage house on his estate, Barton Park in Devonshire. She and her daughters move in, and are frequent guests at Barton Park. Marianne meets the older Colonel Brandon , who falls in love with her at first sight. Competing with him for her affections is the dashing but deceitful John Willoughby , whom Marianne falls in love with. On the morning she expects him to propose marriage to her, he instead leaves hurriedly for London. Unbeknownst to the Dashwood family, Brandon’s ward Beth, illegitimate daughter of his former love Eliza, is pregnant with Willoughby’s child, and Willoughby’s aunt Lady Allen has disinherited him upon discovering this. Sir John’s mother-in-law, Mrs. Jennings , invites her daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Palmer , to visit. They bring with them the impoverished Lucy Steele . Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been engaged secretly for five years, thus dashing Elinor’s hopes of a future with him. Mrs. Jennings takes Lucy, Elinor, and Marianne to London, where they meet Willoughby at a ball. He barely acknowledges their acquaintance, and they learn he is engaged to the extremely wealthy Miss Grey; Marianne is inconsolable. The clandestine engagement of Edward and Lucy also comes to light. Edward’s mother demands that he break off the engagement. When he refuses, his fortune is taken from him and given to his younger brother Robert . On their way home to Devonshire, Elinor and Marianne stop for the night at the country estate of the Palmers, who live near Willoughby. Marianne cannot resist going to see Willoughby's estate and walks a long way in a torrential rain to do so. As a result, she becomes seriously ill and is nursed back to health by Elinor after being rescued by Colonel Brandon. After Marianne recovers, the sisters return home. They learn that Miss Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars and assume that she is married to Edward. However, he arrives to explain that Miss Steele has unexpectedly wed Robert Ferrars and is thus released from his engagement. Edward proposes to Elinor and becomes a vicar, whilst Marianne falls in love with and marries Colonel Brandon.bowling based on novel or book servant country life inheritance rural area military officer period drama rainstorm horse and carriage decorum 19th century devon",False,tt0114388,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,134582776,0,0,7.4114235,2.52164293872272,,,15960245.625,23716495.625,,,,0,,,19077862.2,6.0,29577862.2,5.0,50568481.6,7.0,56368481.6,5.0,,0.0,,,-3148455.0,0.0,851545.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14932374.0,24682374.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,248700832.0,254700832.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,28932629.6,22165962.933333334,1.625,3.6666666666666665,104897737.26798174

The film is set in 1960s Australia. Four orphan boys from a Roman Catholic orphanage in the outback of Australia - Maps, Misty, Spark and Spit - were all born in the month of December, and for their birthday, they are sent on a holiday to the beach to stay with Mr. and Mrs. McAnsh. While there, they meet Fearless, a man who claims to be the risk motorbike rider in the nearby carnival, and his wife, Teresa. Misty, Spark and Spit instantly become closer to Teresa, but Maps, the eldest of the four, is still reluctant to talk to her. He instead finds more fun in spending time with a teenage girl named Lucy, who had come to the beach to stay with her uncle. He often goes up to a place with strange rocks, and meets her there. A few days later, the orphans peek through a window in Fearless' house to see Teresa undressing, but Misty, being the most religious of the four, throws a rock at the wall to make them go away. Misty runs back to Mr. McAnsh's house and looks through the small opening of a door to see someone in the shower, only to find that it is the sickly body of Mrs. McAnsh. They soon realise that she has breast cancer. One night, Misty overhears Fearless talking to his friends about the possibility of adopting one of the orphans. Excited about the opportunity to finally have parents, he keeps it to himself until he decides to reveal it to a priest who has driven to the beach for the orphans' confessions. The other boys realise that he is taking too long, and once he is finished, they force it out of him with the threat of Spit spitting on him while he is pinned to the ground. Misty, Spark and Spit are eager to compete for the love of the seemingly perfect Fearless and Teresa, but Maps is less than excited, even saying to Lucy, ""What's the big deal about parents, anyway?"" Maps experiences his first kiss with Lucy, and soon loses his virginity to her in one of the caves of the Remarkable Rocks. There, she tells him to promise that he will always remember her as his first. The next day, he goes up to the Remarkable Rocks, only to realise that Lucy is not there. Her uncle tells him that she's left the beach to return to her father, and will not be back until next summer. Heartbroken, he goes to the carnival to find Fearless and talk to him, but discovers that he is not a motorbike rider there, and instead cleans up after the animals. Furious that he'd lied all along, he finds a painting made by Misty of him as the son of Fearless and Teresa, and destroys it. Misty attacks him and hits him with the fragments of the frame he'd put the painting in, and the bond between the four orphans is broken. Fearless finds Maps in the cave of the Remarkable Rocks, and explains to him what had really happened. It is revealed to the audience that Fearless was formerly a bike rider, and did all of the stunts with Teresa riding in the back. Then, there was an accident that kept Teresa in the hospital for nearly a year, making her unable to have children. That was the reason they had wanted to adopt one of the orphans. Maps returns to the beach and finds out from Spark and Spit that Misty had gone into the water, and was drowning. Maps goes after him despite the fact that he cannot swim. Both he and Misty nearly drown. Underwater, they open their eyes to see a vision of the Virgin Mary, possibly meaning that they are dying. Before they can reach out to it, the two boys are grabbed by Fearless and brought back to the shore. Maps and Misty reconcile with each other and the four are friends again. The next day, the boys are called to Fearless' and Teresa's house for an announcement. There, they reveal the couple is going to adopt Misty. He take leave of his friends and he watches on the front porch with Fearless and Teresa as the three orphans leave and begin playing on some of the rocks. Misty realises that they were his true family all along, and asks Fearless and Teresa if he can stay with them instead. They accept, and he returns home with the orphans. Several decades later, Misty, as an old man, drives to the same beach with Spark and Spit, along with the ashes of Maps, who had died as a priest in Africa helping refugees, and Lucy's ring that she gave to him. They let the ashes loose in the wind, remembering their time there.sea beach adoption male friendship hope friendship orphanage rivalry teenage crush best friend",False,tt0465436,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,46474,1,0,-85.06963033093774,-6.117028646878049,324968763.0,474968763.0,-10887043.0,1612957.0,,,764420472.0,6,895420472.0,5.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,895420472.0,764420472.0,0.75,5.0,105980128.20199434

As a result, his superiors transfer him to ""crime-free"" Sandford, a town in rural Gloucestershire. Once in Sandford, he immediately arrests a large group of under-age drinkers, and a drunk driver who turns out to be his partner, PC Danny Butterman , the son of local police inspector Frank Butterman . Danny, well-meaning but naive, is in awe of his new partner. Angel struggles to adjust to the slow, uneventful pace of the village. Despite clearing up several otherwise unnoticed crimes, including confiscating a naval mine and a number of unlicensed firearms, Angel soon finds his most pressing concern is an escaped swan. His attention to the letter of the law makes him the target of dislike and mockery by his co-workers. Angel and Butterman eventually bond over drinks at the local pub and action films such as Point Break and Bad Boys II. A series of gruesome deaths shock the town; Angel investigates, believing them to be murders. He attempts to arrest Simon Skinner , the manager of the local Somerfield supermarket, and member of Sandford's Neighbourhood Watch Alliance , under suspicion of murdering the victims due to their involvement in a lucrative property deal. Skinner is able to provide plausible explanations for all of Angel's charges, and a solid alibi. Disappointed and concerned that he has become paranoid, Angel returns to his routine policing with Danny. However, he overhears a shopkeeper inquire about the 'killers'. He realizes that he was wrong in suspecting the murders to be the actions of one person. He takes his multiple-killer theory to Inspector Butterman, who asks him to sleep on it. When Angel returns to his hotel room he is attacked by a cloaked figure. He knocks the attacker unconscious, discovering it's Michael Armstrong , the trolley boy at Somerfield, sent by Skinner to kill Angel. Tipped off by Skinner on Michael's walkie-talkie, Angel heads to the nearby castle where he discovers the truth: Inspector Butterman and the NWA are obsessed with keeping Sandford's ""Village of the Year"" title, murdering anyone who they see as a threat to the village's image . The late Mrs Butterman had put everything into helping Sandford win the first ""Village of the Year"", but travellers ruined the park the night before the judges arrived, which drove her to committing suicide. While fleeing the mob, Angel discovers the bodies of various ""problem"" people whom the NWA had disposed of, but then Danny corners and stabs him. Having tricked the NWA into believing that Angel is dead , Danny drives him to the village limits and releases him, insisting that he knew nothing about their true activities. Danny urges Angel to go back to London, reasoning that no one would believe the truth about Sandford. At a motorway service station, Angel sees Point Break and Bad Boys II on a nearby DVD rack and is inspired to stop the NWA. He drives back to town and arms himself with the guns he confiscated earlier, and with Danny's help engages the NWA in an increasingly destructive series of gun fights, taking down most of them non-fatally. After persuading their colleagues of the truth, Angel and Danny take the battle to Somerfield: Skinner and Inspector Butterman flee, and are pursued by Angel and Danny  to the nearby model village. Angel fights Skinner one-on-one, until Skinner slips and impales his mouth on the spire of the miniature cathedral. Inspector Butterman attempts to escape in Angel's car, but crashes into a tree when the swan attacks him from the back seat. Angel's former superiors arrive from London, begging him to return as the crime rate has risen without him, but Angel chooses to remain in Sandford. Back at the police station, Tom Weaver , the last remaining member of the NWA, attempts to shoot Angel with an antique blunderbuss, but Danny dives in front of Angel and takes the shot. As Weaver tries to reload, Angel jumps and kicks him in the chest, causing him to fall onto the confiscated naval mine, triggering it and destroying the station. Angel tears through the rubble, distraught as he uncovers an unresponsive Danny. One year later, Inspector Angel lays flowers on a grave marked ""Butterman""; it is revealed that Danny has survived and the grave is his mother's. Danny is now a sergeant and Angel the head of the Sandford Police Service, and the two head off to patrol Sandford.village arrest police partner parody murder conspiracy serial killer rural area gunfight english countryside cult film police force accident",False,tt0425112,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,80573774,1,0,5.714481166666666,-6.117028646878049,71915916.21621622,109469970.27027027,,,40123382.375,68635882.375,5920234.5,3,15420234.5,2.0,13141259.0,3.0,20141259.0,2.0,98887799.9090909,15.0,139561030.63636363,11.0,3027375.0,2.0,4727375.0,1.0,-829000.0,1.0,165000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,145632427.66666666,240632427.66666666,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,26332385.0,30332385.0,1.0,,,,-3922864.25,8077135.75,4.0,22616192.5,28116192.5,2.0,85073240.0,116065004.70588236,17.0,,,,11971629.0,28971629.0,2.0,26332385.0,30332385.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,26332385.0,30332385.0,1.0,,,,26332385.0,30332385.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,2870249.0,6870249.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,36002979.82727273,24029533.68181818,3.0,3.4,105980128.20199434

Disliking guns, and considering himself a businessman, he leaves the more violent aspects of the business to his contact Gene . Gene is assisted by fellow gangster Morty ([[George Harris , who had previously spent ten years in prison. Having made his fortune, he plans to retire from the business for good. His plans go awry when his powerful supplier Jimmy Price  sends him to track down Charlie, the teenage daughter of Price's associate, Eddie Temple , who has fled a rehabilitation centre with her drug-addicted boyfriend. To help track her down XXXX enlists the help of con men Cody  and Tiptoes . At the same time, Price instructs XXXX to organize the purchase and distribution of one million ecstasy tablets from a brash, low-level gangster named The Duke . Unbeknownst to XXXX, the pills have been stolen from a gang of Serbian war criminals in the Netherlands. Meanwhile, XXXX encounters The Duke's idiotic nephew, Sidney  at a bar, and becomes attracted to Sidney's bored girlfriend Tammy . XXXX tries to broker the sale of the ecstasy to Liverpudlian gangsters Trevor  and Shanks , but they refuse, informing him of the drugs purloined nature and of the fact that the Serbians have sent a ruthless hitman, Dragan , to find the pills and kill those responsible for their theft. Because The Duke erroneously referenced XXXX's name to the Serbians beforehand, he too is now in danger. Members of The Duke's gang soon begin turning up dead and The Duke himself goes missing. XXXX arranges a tryst with Tammy but before it can be consummated he is kidnapped by henchmen of Eddie Temple. Temple informs him that Jimmy had lost millions of pounds in a failed investment in Africa and is now hoping to sell the pills to recoup his losses. He demands instead that XXXX sell the pills to him, and plays him a tape indicating that Jimmy has been a long term informant for Scotland Yard and intends to betray XXXX to the police as soon as the deal is done. XXXX shoots and kills Jimmy but foolishly does so with a gun that Gene had used to commit a prior murder. XXXX then discovers that his accountant, whom Jimmy referred to him, has embezzled his money and disappeared. Gene and Morty, after being given evidence of Jimmy's snitching, recognize XXXX as the new boss and show him the corpse of The Duke, whom Gene had killed along with Duke's girlfriend, Slasher , when the latter threatened to alert the police about the pills. XXXX delivers the severed head of The Duke to Dragan as a peace offering. To recoup something from the fiasco, XXXX arranges a con in which the police appear to raid The Duke's hideout and confiscate the drugs, which satisfies Dragan. In reality, the police are Cody and Tiptoes, who return the drugs to XXXX. However, when he attempts to sell them to Eddie Temple, Temple steals the drugs from them at gunpoint and gives XXXX a ""welcome to the layer cake"" in the form of a membership to the Stoke Park Club of which both he and Jimmy were members. However, suspecting betrayal, XXXX has arranged for Trevor and Shanks to steal the drugs from Temple's men. The final scene has the gang assembled for lunch at the Stoke Club, proclaiming XXXX their new boss. However, he demurs, stating his intention to stick to his planned retirement. Leaving the club with Tammy he addresses the audience about his own caution and cleverness before being shot without warning by Sidney. As the film fades out, XXXX is seen bleeding on the steps, his fate left uncertain.london, england based on novel or book kidnapping ecstasy drug traffic cocaine drug mule hitman mission of murder gangster planned murder drug smuggle murder cafe violence rooftop cult film neo-noir crack head",False,tt0375912,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,11850214,1,0,0.8231098461538462,1.9257596443831189,,,,,,,3000000.0,1,10000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-143702.0,1.0,4856298.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-8815745.0,2.0,184255.0,1.0,9090735.0,16.0,12090735.0,1.0,16330482.0,4.0,26330482.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19474570.333333332,28141237.0,3.0,157334658.6,186934658.6,5.0,,,,30387568.333333332,37504235.0,3.0,,,,73557872.0,83557872.0,1.0,27006188.0,28356188.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12491080.0,16491080.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10692354.0,3892354.0,3.0,1.0,84824632.31357588

The movie begins with some of the footage of the Rodney King beatings and then switches to a scene showing Sergeant Eldon Perry  pacing around in a motel room. He grabs a shotgun and pistol, and then the movie cuts to a scene with two men in a car , five days earlier. The two men, Darryl Orchard  and Gary Sidwell , appear to be robbing a convenience store, when they are actually after a safe in the room above the store. In the process, four people are murdered, and one severely wounded. The story then shifts to Detective Bobby Keough , who is in a Gun Board hearing in relation to an application of deadly force. His partner, Perry, defends him, and the two leave. Perry, Keough, and Jack Van Meter  are all sitting in a room when they find out that Keough is exonerated. Jack Van Meter is Keough and Perry's superior and a man of poor moral character—he often has his subordinates fabricate stories and evidence. It is later discovered that Perry killed the man that the Gun Board thinks Keough killed, meaning Perry and Keough perjured themselves earlier. Later that night Van Meter goes to Orchard and Sidwell's house and takes the money the two stole from the safe, indicating that the two work for him. That night Keough is shown having sex with a woman who is also a police officer ; the relationship is casual, and they do not reveal their surnames to one another. The next morning Van Meter tells Perry and Keough to investigate the convenience store murder-robbery. Their investigation ends with them finding Orchard and Sidwell as lead suspects; when this is brought to Van Meter, he tells them to pin it on someone else and provides a false alibi for Orchard and Sidwell. Meanwhile, Assistant Chief Arthur Holland  finds Perry's actions suspicious and also does not believe Keough killed the man he was charged with killing at the Gun Board hearing. He asks his assistant Sergeant Beth Williamson, who has a mutual fling with Keough, to help him. When Williamson is pulling files on Perry and Keough, she discovers the identity of her lover to be Keough. Later in the night, after obtaining a search warrant with underhanded techniques, a SWAT team raids the house of the ex-cons who are to be the fall guys. One of the ex-cons escapes and goes into a back alley, but is chased by Perry and Keough. When they catch up, Perry tells Keough to kill the man, but Keough has trouble pulling the trigger. Ultimately, however, Keough does kill the innocent man and is visibly shaken. Later on, Perry arrives at home mid-day and sees a moving truck outside of his house. His wife informs him that she is leaving him for another man. Perry tells her that she can keep the house, and leaves. Keough, still distraught after shooting an unarmed man begging for his life, goes to Williamson's house and confesses to her that he killed the man under Perry's orders. During this time, Van Meter decides he wants Perry killed and calls Orchard and Sidwell to do the job. Van Meter calls Perry and tells him that there is a witness at the address 12657 Juliet. Perry initially balks at this proposal, citing the fact that this ""witness"" was not directly involved, and that this suggested murder would be far different. He finally accepts, and the call ends. Perry then runs the address 12657 Juliet with the department, and it is uncovered to be the address of Orchard and Sidwell. Shocked at this revelation, Perry ultimately decides to arm himself and head out to the address anyway, perhaps to kill Orchard and Sidwell. This links back to the start of the film. Believing that Perry was sent by Van Meter to Orchard and Sidwell , Keough and Williamson also drive to 12657 Juliet. It is while driving there that they learn that the officers involved in the Rodney King beating were found not guilty and the city begins to break down. Turning a corner near Orchard and Sidwell's house, Perry sees Keough and Williamson and all three stop. This pause is only broken as Keough is killed by Orchard and Sidwell firing from the rooftop, and the latter subsequently flee. Before dying, Keough tells Perry that he has ratted him out. Infuriated, Williamson blames Perry for what happened, saying she hopes he will burn in Hell. Perry calls in the incident, hesitating briefly before stating his intention of pursuing Orchard and Sidwell. As they are driving through what are the LA riots, Sidwell is dragged out of his car and beaten to death by rioters while Orchard is captured by Perry. Perry then heads to the police academy promotions ceremony , where he confesses about the corruption and implicates Van Meter. Van Meter attempts to discredit Perry, but ultimately fails as Perry volunteers himself to be arrested, and Holland orders an officer to do so. After the ceremony is adjourned, Perry and Holland chat briefly; Perry is well aware he will be incarcerated, and asks Holland to help him avoid the rougher prisons. Holland says he will see what he can do. The film ends with Perry gazing at a burning skyline of downtown Los Angeles.corruption police brutality riot ghetto street war hold-up robbery moral conflict special unit police everyday life cop los angeles, california family",False,tt0279331,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,9237470,0,0,-0.6238212410974,0.06660377319308829,-5164923.333333333,24918410.0,,,,,44244700.0,21,50244700.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,33309942.5,6.0,49809942.5,2.0,146404396.0,3.0,212404396.0,1.0,-3548372.0,4.0,6451628.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,174868133.0,287368133.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-3000000.0,1500000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,79727666.625,55102666.625,4.25,1.25,95886927.05495417

When his pediatrician wife Katie finds out, she sees it as a justifiable opportunity to file for divorce and continue her extramarital affair unimpeded. Taking her lawyer's advice, she copies financial records and several other files from her husband's computer onto a CD. When the CD gets left on the locker room floor of Hardbodies, a local gym, by a careless law firm employee, it falls into the hands of personal trainer Chad Feldheimer and his co-worker Linda Litzke, who mistake the numerical data in the Cox's bank records and the cryptic first draft of Osbourne's memoir to be highly sensitive government information. After getting the data traced back to Osbourne, Chad and Linda plan to give the disc back to him for a reward, with Linda planning to use the money to pay for cosmetic surgery. But when a phone call and subsequent in-person meeting with Osbourne goes horribly wrong, Chad and Linda turn over the disc to the Russian embassy, offering more information in return for monetary compensation. With no other data to give them, Linda persuades Chad to sneak into the Cox home to get more files from their computer. Meanwhile, Osbourne's increasingly erratic behavior - aggravated in part by his encounters with Chad and Linda - prompt Katie to move ahead with the divorce proceedings. She changes the locks on their house, forcing Osbourne to move onto the sailboat they have docked on Chesapeake Bay. With her husband out of the picture, Katie invites her lover, Harry Pfarrer to move in. A womanizing Treasury Department employee and U.S. Marshal, Pfarrer is coincidentally also secretly seeing Linda. When he finds a strange man hiding in a bedroom closet in Katie's house - actually Chad in search of more documents for Linda - Harry panics and shoots him point blank in the face. Seeing that Chad has no identification or labels in his suit, Harry believes he has just killed a spy and quickly disposes of the body by dumping it in the bay. Two days later at the CIA headquarters, an official named Palmer and his director learn that information from Osbourne has been given to the Russian Embassy. They are perplexed and decide to maintain observation until the situation ""makes sense"". Harry, increasingly anxious after killing a man he believes was a government spy , gets into an argument with Katie and decides to leave the house. On his way out, he spots a man who has been trailing him for the past several days. After tackling him to the ground, Harry finds out that the man is a process server tasked with giving him divorce papers from his wife Sandy, who is having an extramarital liaison of her own. Harry is devastated and goes to see an agitated Linda, who confides in Harry that her friend Chad is missing; he agrees to try to help find him . The next morning, Harry and Linda meet in a park, and she provides him with more information about Chad's disappearance. When Harry realizes that Chad is the man he killed, he flees in terror, assuming Linda is also a spy. Linda then turns to Ted Treffon, the kindhearted manager of Hardbodies, who has unrequited feelings for her. Believing the Russians have kidnapped Chad, he agrees to go to the Cox home to search Osbourne's computer. Unemployed and having spent the past several days living on a small boat, Osbourne becomes unhinged when he finds out that his wife has emptied his bank accounts, and, no longer having keys, decides to break into the house to get some of his personal belongings. Finding Ted in the basement, Osbourne initially takes him to be Katie's lover. He soon realizes Ted's affiliation with Linda and the rest of the ""league of morons"" he feels he has been struggling against his whole life, and fires a gunshot at him. Ted manages to get out of the house, only to be fatally attacked by a hatchet-wielding Osbourne. At CIA headquarters a few days later, Palmer and his director try to understand what exactly happened. It is revealed that while trying to board a flight to Venezuela, Harry was detained because his name was on a hot list, Ted's body has been disposed of and the CIA are holding Linda who is promising to keep quiet about everything if they will pay for her cosmetic surgery. A CIA agent shot Osbourne during his hatchet assault on Ted and the bullet has put Osbourne in a coma. The director instructs Palmer to let Harry fly to Venezuela, mistakenly saying that the US has no extradition treaty with Venezuela, decides the CIA will pay for Linda's surgery and postpones considering Osbourne's situation until he regains consciousness, which is not likely. The director tells Palmer that they did not really learn anything.blackmail paranoia fitness-training plastic surgery autobiography memory corpse divorce gym disc ex priest",False,tt0887883,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,163720069,0,0,3.4248667297297297,-1.6278585820155915,19049486.375,44611986.375,42470376.4,75470376.4,90208010.44,114493930.44,79537724.5,11,155037724.5,2.0,26017230.0,12.0,47017230.0,2.0,102182269.25,8.0,184682269.25,4.0,53852968.666666664,24.0,86564079.77777778,9.0,159928763.0,8.0,223278763.0,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-23060577.0,27.0,939423.0,1.0,,,,19360581.8,30360581.8,5.0,,,,,,,42693441.25,58943441.25,4.0,14462845.0,37891416.428571425,7.0,20552391.6,39952391.6,5.0,,,,46734163.5,63234163.5,2.0,55499575.125,77535575.125,8.0,,,,,,,31955952.25,46205952.25,4.0,34807074.6,48907074.6,5.0,,,,,,,,,,17893097.5,38393097.5,4.0,,,,,,,,,,45868327.0,71868327.0,1.0,,,,-6040249.0,69959751.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,116253248.25462963,66409729.73611111,11.25,3.6666666666666665,95612307.5388973

Mr. Fletcher leaves on a trip for several days to join friends and memorialize Waller, leaving his only employee, Mike , to tend to the store. Before leaving Mr. Fletcher cautions Mike to keep his paranoid and klutzy friend, Jerry , away from the store. After attempting to sabotage a nearby electrical substation, believing its energy to be melting his brain, Jerry becomes magnetized, and when he enters the store the next day, he inadvertently erases all the VHS tapes in the store . Mike quickly discovers the disaster, and is further pressed when Miss Falewicz , Mr. Fletcher's friend, wants to rent Ghostbusters. To prevent her from reporting a problem to Mr. Fletcher, Mike comes up with an idea: as Miss Falewicz has never seen the movie, he proposes to recreate the film using himself and Jerry as the actors and cheap special effects hoping to fool her. They complete the movie just in time when another customer asks for Rush Hour 2. Mike and Jerry repeat their filming, enlisting the help of Alma , a local woman, for some of the parts. Word of mouth spreads through Miss Falewicz's nephew  of the inadvertently hilarious results of Mike and Jerry's filming, and soon the store is seeing more requests for such movies. Mike, Jerry, and Alma quickly pass off the movies as being ""sweded"", insisting the films came from Sweden and thus able to demand long wait times and higher costs for the rental. Soon, to meet demand, Mike and Jerry enlist the locals to help out in making the movies, using them as starring roles in their films. When Mr. Fletcher returns, intent on converting the store to a DVD rental outlet, he quickly recognizes that they are making more money from the sweded films than from normal rentals, and joins in with the process. However, the success is put to a halt when two court bailiffs  arrive, insisting the sweded films are copyright violations, and seize the tapes and the store's assets, crushing the tapes with a steamroller. Without any money to renovate the building, Mr. Fletcher gives up hope, and is forced to reveal to Mike that he made up the character of Fats Waller. Mr. Fletcher is given a week to evacuate the building before it will be razed. Jerry, with the help of the local townspeople, convinces Mr. Fletcher and Mike to give one last hurrah and put together a documentary dedicated to the fake life of Fats Waller, and the two quickly warm up to the idea. On the day the building is scheduled for demolition, Mr. Fletcher invites all the locals to watch the final film. In his eagerness to start the show due to the presence of the demolition crew waiting to start the job, Jerry accidentally breaks the only TV the store has, but a nearby DVD store owner loans them his video projector, allowing them to show the movie on a white cloth placed in the store's window. As their film ends, Mr. Fletcher, Mike and Jerry exit the store to find a crowd has gathered to watch the film through the window, including the city official and wrecking crew, and they are given a rousing applause by the gathered crowd. The final fate of the store is left ambiguous.  Films that were erased and recreated are referred to as having been sweded. These remakes are unedited with only a single take per scene. The tapes are described as having come from Sweden as an excuse for higher rental fees and longer wait times. Jerry fabricated the word ""sweded"" while arguing with Craig  and his gang. In light of the theme of sweding, director Michel Gondry sweded a version of the trailer of the film, starring himself. On the official website, users can engage in sweding, which puts their faces on the VHS cover of a movie.Matheson, Whitney. USA Today. Web watch. Life section, page 3D.

Salinger's and Whitman's investigation takes them from Berlin to Milan, where the IBBC assassinates Umberto Calvini, an arms manufacturer who is an Italian prime ministerial candidate. The bank's assassin diverts suspicion to a local assassin with political connections, who is promptly killed by a corrupt policeman. Salinger and Whitman get a lead on the second assassin, but the corrupt policeman shows up again and orders them out of the country. At the airport they are able to check the security camera footage for clues, and follow a suspect to New York. In New York, Salinger and Whitman are met by two NYPD detectives, Iggy Ornelas  and Bernie Ward ([[Jack McGee , who have a photograph of the assassin's face when he arrived in New York airport. Salinger, Ornelas, and Ward locate Dr. Isaacson  to whose practice the assassin's leg brace has been traced. They find the assassin  and follow him to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Jonas Skarssen , the chairman of the IBBC, reveals to his senior men White  and Wexler  that the bank had Calvini killed so that they could deal with his sons to buy guidance systems for missiles in which the bank has invested. Since the bank knows that Salinger and Whitman are close to finding their assassin, they send a hit team to kill him at a meeting between him and his handler, Wexler. Wexler leaves and is arrested by Ornelas. As Salinger speaks to the assassin, a spectacular gunfight at the Guggenheim erupts when a number of gunmen attempt to kill them with automatic weapons. They escape, but the assassin is mortally wounded. In interrogation, Wexler, a former Stasi colonel, explains to Salinger that the IBBC is practically untouchable because of its utility to terrorist organisations, drug cartels, governments, and powerful corporations of all complexions. Even if he succeeds in bringing the IBBC down there are hundreds of other banks which will replace them. If Salinger wants justice, he needs to go outside the system, and Wexler indicates a willingness to help. In Italy, Salinger tells the Calvini brothers of the IBBC's responsibility for their father's murder, prompting them to cancel the deal with the bank and have White killed. Salinger then accompanies Wexler to Istanbul, where Skarssen is buying the crucial components from their only other manufacturer. Salinger attempts to record the conversation so that he can obstruct the deal by proving to the buyers that the missiles will be useless, but he ultimately fails. Both Wexler and Skarssen are then killed by a hitman contracted by Enzo and Mario Calvini to avenge their father's murder by the bank. Salinger is left stunned, his investigation, pursuit, and determination to bring down the IBBC, have led him to nothing. During the closing credits, it is indicated that the bank is successfully continuing with its operations despite the death of its Chairman—as Skarssen had predicted to Salinger before he was killed. However with the new and more aggressive chairman, it is hinted that the IBBC's increased expansion and aggression will ultimately lead to its downfall, as shown by the last panel, revealing the beginnings of a United States Senate investigation, headed by Whitman.duringcreditsstinger",False,tt0963178,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,60161391,1,0,0.20322782,39.7198236153607,47696114.833333336,116029448.16666667,,,44822796.0,64822796.0,40039658.2,8,98599658.2,5.0,-1227260.5,2.0,32022739.5,2.0,1561208.5,18.0,29061208.5,2.0,,0.0,,,-143702.0,6.0,4856298.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-32589251.0,2.0,5410749.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,44822796.0,64822796.0,1.0,293899169.0,391565835.6666667,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33990130.64,1528130.6400000006,4.5,2.2,151278235.71911615

One day, Johnson dies of a heart attack at an electronics store. Frank dislikes the new, flashy gangsters who are in line to take over Harlem and decides to take control himself. Meanwhile, Newark Police Department detective Richie Roberts  is juggling a failing marriage, late-night law school classes, and his police career. When Richie and his partner, Javier Rivera , discover nearly 1&nbsp;million in unmarked bills in a car, Richie resists temptation and turns the money in. His rare honesty makes him a hated member of his precinct, causing his partner to be exiled from the force, while Richie's rampant womanizing behavior and undercover double life leads his wife to seek a divorce and custody of their son. After his exiled partner dies from overdosing on ""Blue Magic"", a relatively new and powerful type of heroin being sold for less money than its drug competition, Richie's honesty catches him a break when his superior Captain Lou Toback  puts him in charge of a newly created task force to stop major drug trafficking in Essex County, New Jersey by going after the actual supplier, rather than the middle-men. Richie handpicks honest cops and gets to work on finding who is supplying Blue Magic. Blue Magic is being supplied by Frank Lucas, who took over Bumpy's gang. After hearing a TV report referring to the cheaper drugs supplied to servicemen in Vietnam, Lucas decided to cut out the middle-man and buy his drugs directly from the producers in Thailand. By cutting out the middle-man, Frank is able to provide a higher quality product at a cheaper price than his rivals, eventually wholesaling drugs to most of the dealers in the New York area, while making his tracking by the authorities more difficult. He smuggles his drugs into the country by way of the US military involved in the Vietnam War. He creates a brand drug “Blue Magic” and with a great monopoly on quality product, Frank quickly makes a fortune and buys several nightclubs and apartments. He moves his family from North Carolina to New Jersey, where he purchases a large estate for his humble mother. His five brothers are enlisted as his gang lieutenants in the drug trade – forming “The Country Boys” - who work together to traffic and sell dope on New York area streets. During his rise, Frank meets and falls in love with Eva, a Puerto Rican beauty queen. Through his discipline, intelligence, organization, power, and willingness to kill everyone who stands in his way, Frank quickly rises to the top of the Harlem drug and crime scene as the biggest gang leader and drug dealer. As Frank's business prospers, he makes a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign of strength and to avoid attracting the attention of the law. However, Frank disregards this habit for his soon-to-be wife for one ostentatious night out, attending the Fight of the Century between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, in a gaudy chinchilla fur coat and hat, along with a ringside seat. As it happens, Roberts is on duty observing the event and sees this unknown, but obviously wealthy person associating with high-level criminals, as well as having better seats than the Italian Mafia high-stake Dons. Roberts becomes suspicious, and he begins to investigate this, unknown to him but well-known to the criminals, figure in New York organized crime. Even as Frank realizes he has exposed himself to police scrutiny, he must make deals with the Mafia, in this case Lucchese crime family Mob boss Dominic Cattano , and fend off corrupt NYPD detectives, such as Det. Nick Trupo , who attempt to extort and threaten him. Trupo interrupts Frank as he and his new wife are heading to their honeymoon. In retaliation Frank has Trupo's prized 1966 Shelby Mustang GT350-H<ref namehttp://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_115217-Shelby-GT-350-H-1966.html|titleJune 28, 2012}}  bombed before his eyes. Frank must also contend with local crime figure called Nicky Barnes , who is taking some of Frank's product, diluting it himself, and selling it under Frank's ""Blue Magic"" brand name. Unidentified assassins try to kill Frank & his wife, further destabilizing him and threatening his marriage. Things take a turn for the worse when the Fall of Saigon cuts off Frank's supply. His Kuomintang supplier sympathetically tells him ""Quitting while you are ahead...is not the same as quitting."" Richie catches another break when his men witness Frank's cousin shooting a woman. They use the driver’s predicament to get him to wear a wire. The wire allows Richie and his task force to discover when a plane carrying drugs is landing. The plane is a C-130 carrying some of the last U.S. Soldiers returning from Vietnam. Richie has his men search everyone and everything literally tearing the plane apart and even looking in the coffins of dead soldiers. Richie is ordered to cease his search by a Federal agent, who dismisses the influence of Frank and his ""negro""-run drug family. Meanwhile, Trupo and his men break into Frank's mansion and steals his emergency cash supply, as well as kill his German Shepherd dog. Frank initially sets out to kill Trupo, but his mother manages to dissuade him. Richie and his men continue observing the plane's contents and follow the drugs into Newark's projects and obtain a warrant. A huge group of police and detectives attack the drug apartments en masse and a large shootout ensues. Steve Lucas, Frank's nephew , who gave up a promising baseball career with the New York Yankees to work for his uncle, is shot in the shootout. Frank is at the church when the bust goes down, but he is arrested after the service ends. Richie meets with Frank and makes it clear to him that he has enough evidence to put him away for the rest of his life. He then tells Frank that he has a chance of doing a shorter term in jail if he helps him in the case. With no other options, Frank decides to provide names of dirty cops working for the NYPD. Numerous cops are arrested, and a distraught Trupo commits suicide with his revolver to avoid arrest. Richie, having passed the bar exam, prosecutes Frank. In the end, three quarters of the New York Drug Enforcement Agency are arrested and convicted. Once convicted, Lucas provides evidence that leads to more than 100 further drug-related convictions. In 1977, Lucas and his family are placed in the witness protection program, hiding somewhere in the country. Frank has his Federal and state term reduced four years later in 1981, and in 1984 is caught and convicted of trying to exchange one ounce of heroin and 13,000 for one kilogram of cocaine. He is defended by his former prosecutor, Richie Roberts, now a criminal defense attorney, and receives a sentence of seven years. At the film’s end, Frank steps out of jail in 1991, significantly older and out of place, now just a normal man. In a post-credits scene, he pulls out a gun and shoots ""the camera"".underdog black people drug traffic ghetto gangster drug smuggle society ambition rise and fall cop drug dealing police corruption police detective family law enforcement aftercreditsstinger dishonesty criminal heroes",False,tt0765429,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,266465037,1,0,1.66465037,-6.117028646878049,,,,,74456162.0,111322015.65853658,18077776.0,26,47077776.0,4.0,354640427.0,7.0,457640427.0,1.0,-3045058.0,2.0,39954942.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-5396999.0,3.0,14603001.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,176297822.25,253797822.25,4.0,,,,108048505.0,192298505.0,4.0,103994969.875,169307469.875,8.0,,,,-36602.11111111111,30407842.333333332,9.0,173167713.0,281667713.0,2.0,,,,,,,115900950.66666667,178317617.33333334,6.0,121146936.5,189480269.83333334,6.0,,,,82944923.0,162944923.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,172424412.0,280757745.3333333,3.0,,,,,,,,,,-5396999.0,14603001.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,139819036.5,91069036.5,4.75,2.0,105980128.20199434

A frightened scientist named Dr. Jorge Vargas  makes arrangements for a package containing two vials to be delivered to a Dr. Walter Jennings , then vanishes. Polly Perkins , a newspaper reporter for The Chronicle, looks into the disappearances of Vargas and five other renowned scientists. She receives a cryptic message telling her to go to Radio City Music Hall. Ignoring the warning of editor Paley  not to go, she meets Dr. Jennings during a showing of The Wizard of Oz. He tells her that Dr. Totenkopf is coming for him. Suddenly, air raid sirens go off as giant indestructible robots attack the city. In desperation, the police call for ""Sky Captain"" Joe Sullivan , who commands a private air force based in New York, the Flying Legion. Polly photographs the action from the street as Sullivan knocks out one robot and the rest leave. News reports show similar attacks around the globe. The robot's wreckage is taken back to the Legion's air base so that its expert, Dex Dearborn , can examine it. Polly follows, hoping to get information for her story. She and Joe are ex-lovers, who broke up three years earlier in China where Joe was serving with the Flying Tigers. Since it appears Polly has useful information, Joe agrees to let her in on the investigation. Her lead takes them to the ransacked laboratory of Dr. Jennings, with the scientist himself near death. The killer, a mysterious woman , escapes. Jennings gives Polly two vials, which he says are crucial to Dr. Totenkopf's plans. Polly withholds this information from Joe. They return to the Legion's base, which comes under attack from squadrons of ornithopter drones. Dex manages to track the origin of the robot control signal, but he's captured. However, he leaves behind a part of a map marking the location of Totenkopf's base. Joe and Polly find it and head to Nepal. Venturing into the Himalayas, they discover an abandoned mining outpost. Two guides turn out to be working for Totenkopf, forcing Polly to turn over the vials and then locking her and Joe in a room full of explosives, which they light. Joe and Polly are knocked unconscious by the explosion. They wake up together in the mythical Shangri-La. The monks there tell of Totenkopf's enslavement of their people, forcing them to work in the uranium mines. Most were killed by the radiation, but the final survivor  provides a clue to where Totenkopf is hiding. This leads them to another of Joe's ex-flames, Commander Franky Cook , who commands a Royal Navy flying aircraft carrier with submarine aircraft. Franky leads the attack while Joe and Polly enter through an underwater inlet. After surfacing, Polly notices that the identification number on Joe's aircraft reads ""Polly"" when viewed upside-down. Joe and Polly find themselves on an island with dinosaur-like creatures. They head to a mountain and find a secret underground facility, where robots are loading animals, as well as the mysterious vials, onto a large ""Noah's Ark"" rocket. Joe and Polly are detected and nearly killed. Dex, piloting a barge, arrives in the nick of time with three of the missing scientists. Dex explains that Totenkopf has given up on humanity and seeks to start the world over again: the ""World of Tomorrow"". The vials are genetic material for a male and female human: a new Adam and Eve. In Totenkopf's lair, one scientist is incinerated by the defense system. A holograph of Totenkopf  appears and speaks. Dex disables the defenses and the group discovers Totenkopf's mummified corpse. He had died 20 years before, but his machines have carried on his work. In his hand is a scrap of paper reading ""forgive me"". The only way to sabotage the rocket is from the inside. Polly tries to tag along, but Joe kisses her and knocks her out. He prepares to sacrifice himself while the others escape. Polly recovers and follows Joe, arriving in time to save him from the mysterious woman, who turns out to be a robot. The two board the rocket. Before it reaches 100&nbsp;km, when its second stage fires and incinerates the earth, Polly pushes an emergency button that ejects all the animals in escape pods. Joe tries to disable the rocket only to be interrupted by the same robot. He jolts her with her electric weapon and then uses it on the controls, disabling the rocket. They use the last pod to save themselves as the rocket safely explodes. Joe and Polly watch the animal pods splash down around their escape pod. Polly then uses the last shot on her camera to take a picture of Joe. He tells her that the lens cap was still on the camera. Polly's look of joy turns to shock as she realizes she has no proof any of their adventure happened.london, england himalaya journalist killer robot computer war steampunk robot",False,tt0346156,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,57958696,1,0,-0.20775664103968108,1.9257596443831189,-10436022.0,2063978.0,-2845606.6923076925,40692854.84615385,,,36948830.333333336,5,90948830.33333333,3.0,76107881.75,6.0,91857881.75,4.0,,0.0,,,167982836.5,3.0,206482836.5,4.0,61505388.0,1.0,156505388.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-4693269.0,26.0,13806731.0,2.0,,,,31515302.6,72915302.6,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37275263.5,90025263.5,2.0,13564027.0,14564027.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,101265204.0,179265204.0,1.0,,,,,,,174956144.66666666,246622811.33333334,3.0,,,111920333.51666667,67570333.51666667,5.125,2.8,84824632.31357588

In the shorter of the two, Holmes is approached by a famous Russian ballerina, Madame Petrova , who proposes that they conceive a child together, one who she hopes will inherit her physique and his intellect. Holmes manages to extricate himself by claiming that Watson is his lover, much to the doctor's embarrassment.  This part of the story was clearly inspired by the meeting between playwright George Bernard Shaw and the dancer Isadora Duncan. She is reported to have said, ""You are the greatest brain in the world and I have the most beautiful body, so we ought to produce the most perfect child."", to which he replied, ""What if the child inherits my beauty and your brains?"" In the main plot, Belgian Gabrielle Valladon  is fished out of the River Thames and brought to Baker Street. She begs Holmes to find her missing engineer husband. The resulting investigation leads to a castle in Scotland. Along the way, they encounter a group of monks and some midgets, and Watson apparently sights the Loch Ness monster. It turns out that Sherlock's brother Mycroft  is involved in building a pre-World War I submarine for the British Navy, with the assistance of Monsieur Valladon.  When taken out for testing, it was disguised as a sea monster. The midgets were recruited as crewmen because they took up less space and needed less air. When they meet, Mycroft informs Sherlock that his client is actually a top German spy, Ilse von Hoffmanstal, sent to steal the submersible. The ""monks"" are German sailors. Queen Victoria  arrives for an inspection of the new weapon, but objects to its unsportsmanlike nature. She orders the exasperated Mycroft to destroy it, so he conveniently leaves it unguarded for the monks to take . Fräulein von Hoffmanstal is arrested, to be exchanged for her British counterpart. In the final scene some months later, Sherlock receives a message from his brother, telling him that von Hoffmanstal had been arrested as a spy in Japan and subsequently, executed by firing squad. Saddened, the detective retreats to his room to seek solace in drugs and his violin.sherlock holmes loch ness monster german spy midgets",False,tt0066249,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1500000,0,0,-5.666666666666668,13.426263831701446,,,81461669.42857143,85454526.57142857,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,84558.0,4.0,364937.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20742193.0,27022193.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24350000.0,29950000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,364937.0,84558.0,0.5,1.0,74094781.91396043

On the way, they encounter actor Ivor Novello , American film producer Morris Weissman  and Weissman's valet, Henry Denton . At the house, they are greeted by Sir William McCordle , Lady Sylvia McCordle  and their daughter, Isobel . The other guests include Lady Sylvia's sisters, Louisa, Lady Stockbridge  and Lady Lavinia Meredith  and their husbands, Raymond, Lord Stockbridge  and Commander Anthony Meredith . Also in attendance are the Honourable Freddie Nesbitt  and his wife, Mabel ; Isobel's suitor, Lord Rupert Standish  and his friend Jeremy Blond . Commander Meredith is in financial difficulty and brings up the matter with Sir William, who reveals that he is rescinding his investment in Meredith's new scheme. Sir William also intends to stop paying Lady Trentham's allowance. Mary and Lord Stockbridge's valet, Parks  are attracted to one another. Denton asks a number of questions about life in service and Parks reveals that he was raised in an orphanage. Denton meets Lady Sylvia and during the night, he goes to her room. During the pheasant shoot Sir William is slightly injured by a low shot. Commander Meredith pleads with Sir William not to back out of the investment. During dinner, Lady Sylvia attacks Sir William, implying that he was a World War I profiteer. The head housemaid, Elsie , rises to his defence, thus revealing their affair. Sir William goes to the library, where the housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson  brings him coffee. He demands a glass of whisky instead. Lady Sylvia asks Mr. Novello to entertain the guests. George , Parks, Mr. Nesbitt and Commander Meredith disappear and an unknown man goes to the library and stabs Sir William. Commander Meredith and Mr. Nesbitt do not offer an explanation of their disappearances, while George was fetching milk for the coffee service and Parks was fetching hot water bottles. Lady Stockbridge goes to the library and her screams bring everyone to the room. Inspector Thomson  and Constable Dexter  arrive to investigate the murder. Dexter suggests that Sir William was already dead when he was stabbed. Denton confesses to Jennings , the butler, that he is not a valet but an American actor preparing for a movie role. The next morning, Lady Sylvia goes for her morning ride, which surprises Inspector Thomson. Barnes  overhears Commander Meredith tell Lady Lavinia that Sir William's death was lucky for them, as the investment is now secure. Barnes tells Inspector Thomson, who interrogates Meredith. Mrs. Croft  tells the kitchen maid, Bertha , that Sir William was known for seducing the women working in his factories. If a woman became pregnant, Sir William offered two choices: keep the baby and lose your job, or give the baby up and keep your job. Those who gave up their babies were told that the adoptions were being arranged with good families. In reality, Sir William paid orphanages to take the children. Mary goes to Parks's room and tells him that she knows he is the murderer. Parks tells her that he discovered Sir William was his father, entered service and attempted to gain employment with someone in his circle. Parks tells Mary that he did not poison Sir William and Mary is relieved, as Parks only stabbed the corpse. Mary listens to Lady Sylvia and Lady Trentham discussing why Mrs. Croft and Mrs. Wilson are enemies. Lady Sylvia believes that the tension between them stems from the fact that Mrs. Wilson now outranks Mrs. Croft. Lady Trentham asks if Mrs. Wilson was ever married and Lady Sylvia replies that her name was once Parks or Parker. Mary goes to Mrs. Wilson and the older woman reveals that she poisoned Sir William in order to protect her son, as she knew that Parks was there to kill Sir William. She also reveals that she and Mrs. Croft are sisters. After talking to Dorothy , Mrs. Wilson goes to her room and is comforted by Mrs. Croft. The guests leave and Lady Sylvia enters Gosford Park, while Jennings closes the door.servant butler country estate industrialist weekend inspector murder countess money maid housekeeper valet shooting party upstairs downstairs 1930s",False,tt0280707,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,87754044,0,0,3.4320224242424238,-0.8553948535632829,,,,,,,23967437.0,20,34967437.0,1.0,,0.0,,,7322513.666666667,16.0,15389180.333333334,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,111384849.0,9.0,123184849.0,4.0,4535191.0,2.0,18535191.0,1.0,,,,78560615.5,102810615.5,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70361962.33333333,93028629.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,118582776.0,134582776.0,1.0,20545404.333333332,27345404.333333332,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,166387367.0,203720700.33333334,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,48019164.333333336,36802497.666666664,5.875,2.25,121757219.71668534

Her parents, Leo  and Justine , let her attend, under the condition that she returns at midnight and calls if she's going to be late. Arriving early at the party, Angelica immediately attempts to acquire ecstasy and suspects an attendee named Swan  is carrying the drug. When asked about it, Swan informs the two girls that he doesn't have any ecstasy on him, but he has it in a nearby cabin, where his friends live. He requests that Emily and Angelica come to the cabin with him and meet his friends; the two comply. Unbeknownst to the girls, Swan's friends are actually his father Chaos ([[Kevin Gage , a notorious and wanted criminal and his father's gang, which consists of Chaos' girlfriend Daisy  and felon Frankie . Chaos sent his son to the party to lure unsuspecting females to him. Upon their arrival at the cabin, Emily and Angelica are quickly captured by the gang and taken to an abandoned part in the woods. The girls manage to escape their captors and split up in an attempt to make it harder for Chaos and his gang to find them. Angelica is ultimately caught by Daisy and brought before Chaos, who tortures and stabs her death, and then proceeds to violate her corpse. Chaos and his group continue their pursuit of Emily, even as the sun sets. They briefly re-encounter her, but Emily manages to steal Daisy's knife in a struggle and stabs Swan in the genitals. Knowing his wound is fatal, Chaos suffocates his son and promises to murder Emily. Meanwhile, Justine becomes nervous about Emily's whereabouts when she doesn't answer cell phone and convinces Leo to call the police. However, Justine suspects MacDunner , the investigating officer, won't attempt to find her, so she and Leo go into the woods themselves. While searching for Emily, the couple find Angelica's corpse. Chaos and Frankie finally recapture Emily and bound her with rope. In retaliation for his son's death, Chaos brutally violates Emily with his knife. With both girls dead, the gang prepares to leave the area, when Chaos' van fails to start up. Knowing that they'll be caught if they stay in the woods, Chaos and his gang leave the vehicle and look for a car to steal. Their van is then found by MacDunner and his partner Wilson , who discover blood stained clothes. The gang decides to go to a nearby house, with the intent of stealing the owner's car, unaware of the fact that they arrived at Emily's home. Leo lets Chaos and his group stay at the home, but notices that Daisy is wearing Emily's belt. Suspecting the group of being involved with Emily's disappearance, Leo calls the police, while Chaos and Frankie prepare to hot-wire his car and kill the couple. Chaos is confronted by a shotgun wielding Leo, determined to find out what happened to his daughter. When Frankie arrives with a captured Justine, Chaos disarms Leo and takes the shotgun. Instead of shooting Leo and Justine, however, Chaos shoots Daisy when she tries to convince him to leave the house. In the ensuing confusion, the couple escapes. Leo emerges with a chainsaw and slashes Frankie across the stomach, and proceeds to attack Chaos. In the ensuing struggle, Leo manages to get the upper hand and prepares to kill Chaos. Before he can, MacDunner arrives and kills Leo when he refuses to drop his weapon. Justine retaliates by shooting MacDunner in the back and Wilson is killed by Chaos. Chaos then shoots Justine in the head and his laughter is heard.chaos theory bank robbery",False,tt0402910,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,7000248,0,0,-1.8570416362391733,-2.6760407675788414,,,,,,,72211410.33333333,7,95994743.66666667,3.0,67954044.0,4.0,87754044.0,1.0,1554476.0,15.0,2554476.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,64370388.625,105495388.625,8.0,,,,,,,92473729.5,143473729.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11682170.0,36682170.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,264317794.0,289317794.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,62101087.88888889,47239976.777777776,3.25,1.6666666666666667,109858494.28372188

Adrian is emotionally repressed, prone to suspicion and paranoia, devoted to old movies and to his mother, who resides in a nursing home, suffering from dementia. Adrian visits her frequently, holding conversations which as her illness progresses become increasingly one-sided. Adrian is a tenant in a rundown apartment building; he lives in apartment 10, although the 1 is missing from his door . Apart from his mother, the core of his emotional life is movies--specifically classic American movies and stars. Apartment Zero opens with a shot of Adrian in his theater, watching the final scene of Touch of Evil. As his theater, Cine York, loses more and more money, Adrian advertises for a roommate to share his apartment. After several unsatisfactory applicants he meets the handsome, charming, and macho American Jack Carney . Adrian is clearly attracted to Jack and Jack is clearly aware of it. Jack agrees to take the room. They quickly settle into a domestic routine, with Adrian taking over laundry and cooking duties for Jack and Jack joining Adrian for films at his cinema. They also begin to bond emotionally. In contrast to Adrian's standoffishness, Jack establishes relationships with several of the neighbors, a rather odd bunch. Adrian, upset and jealous, lashes out at Jack, telling him that the neighbors aren't to be trusted. Despite Adrian's jealousy Jack continues to socialize with several of them, including becoming sexually involved with a female neighbor . Claudia, the ticket seller at Adrian's cinema, is involved with a political committee that's investigating a series of murders that bear a striking resemblance to those committed by members of death squads that operated in Argentina dating back to the 1970s. Adrian learns that Jack has been lying about being employed with a local computer company and becomes paranoid that Jack is spying on him but at the same time terrified that Jack will leave him. He searches Jack's room and finds a number of photographs of Jack in paramilitary garb. When Jack returns, a highly agitated Adrian begs him, ""If that's a mask, either take it off now or leave it on forever."" Jack calms him but his own suspicions are aroused when he realizes that Adrian's been in his room. Despite being himself apolitical, Adrian allows Claudia's committee to use his theatre to view footage of death squad members. Adrian watches some of it and is horrified to see the same sign in the film as appeared in some of the photos of Jack he'd found earlier. Jack, realizing that Adrian is growing more suspicious, falsifies Adrian's passport and prepares to leave Argentina. Unfortunately for him, the passport is expired and he can't leave. Jack picks up a gay man at the airport and goes to a hotel with him, where he murders him for his passport--but then makes a hash of trying to paste his own photos into the dead man's passport. Meanwhile, Adrian is devastated by the death of his mother. Claudia spots Jack in a death squad photo. He's identified as ""Michael Weller"" and listed as dead, but was identified only by his papers and a ring. Adrian gets drunk and creates a disturbance in his apartment, concerning his neighbors. The following morning a television report of the murder of a young man ironically leads the neighbors to think that Adrian has done something to Jack. That evening, the neighbors confront Adrian, forcing their way into his apartment and physically attacking him. Jack--unsuccessful in solving his passport problem--returns just then and soothes and tends to the badly injured Adrian. As Adrian attends his mother's funeral, Claudia comes to the apartment and recognizes Jack. Adrian returns to find Claudia dead at Jack's hands. Jack tries to charm him, telling him ""let me clean up and I'll put the mask back on, OK?"" A clearly unhinged Adrian, as terrified of losing Jack as he is horrified by the murder, helps Jack dispose of the body. On the way out they run into one of the neighbors and Jack says he's leaving for California in the morning. After they dump the body, Adrian suggests they really go to California together and Jack enthusiastically agrees. Back at the apartment Adrian changes his mind and goes for Jack's gun in the living room. Jack comes out of his room and Adrian runs back toward his. Jack realizes what's happening and they both go for the gun. Jack gets the upper hand and begins strangling Adrian, but can't go through with it and lets him up. Adrian again goes for the gun and he and Jack struggle again. With the gun pointed at him and with Adrian's finger on the trigger, Jack says ""Do it"" and the gun goes off. Some days after, Adrian is having dinner when a neighbor comes to the door seeking Jack's address in California. Adrian says he hasn't heard from him and shuts the door. He returns to the table and pours two glasses of wine, one for himself and one for Jack's corpse, which he has kept and sat at the table. The final scene shows Adrian's cinema, with a fairly large crowd--all men--pouring out--apparently the lean days are over. That's because the cinema is now a porn theater. And we see Adrian, who has never throughout the film gone out in public without a suit and tie , leaving the building wearing a tee-shirt and Jack's black leather jacket, smoking a cigarette--all just as Jack used to do.cia drag queen cat flat distrust cohabitant hitman buenos aires, argentina mission of murder male friendship film and cinema boarder neighbor cowardliness",False,tt0094667,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,670774,0,0,-4.9632603529653805,-0.030070667040354673,,,,,,,-20703562.0,5,14296438.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14296438.0,-20703562.0,0.625,1.0,88766264.70698021

Ian retreats from domestic life, preferring to write poetry in solitude. In July 1976 they attend a Sex Pistols concert with Bernard Sumner , Peter Hook ([[Joe Anderson , and Terry Mason , who are starting a band. Mesmerized by the concert, Ian volunteers to be their singer. They name themselves Warsaw, and Terry moves into a managerial role with the addition of drummer Stephen Morris . The band debuts 19 May 1977 and soon rename themselves Joy Division. Ian and Debbie finance their first EP, An Ideal for Living . During his job as an employment agent, Ian witnesses a seizure suffered by Corinne Lewis . Unsatisfied with the brief mention Joy Division receives from television host Tony Wilson , Ian demands that that he put the band on his program. In April 1978 Joy Division plays a battle of bands, impressing Tony and Rob Gretton , who becomes their new manager. They perform ""Transmission"" on Tony's program and sign to his Factory Records label; Tony signs the contract using his own blood. In December 1978 Ian suffers a seizure on the way back from the band's first London gig; He is diagnosed with epilepsy and prescribed medications that leave him drowsy and moody. Learning that Corinne Lewis has died of a seizure, he pens ""She's Lost Control"" about her. He begins to neglect Debbie, who gives birth to their daughter Natalie in April 1979. Ian quits his job to go on tour, leaving Debbie to work and care for the baby. Ian admits to Belgian journalist Annik Honoré  that he is miserable at home and considers his marriage a mistake. The two begin having an affair during Joy Division's January 1980 European tour. On returning home, Ian tells Debbie he is unsure if he still loves her. During the recording of ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"", Rob informs the band that they will be departing 19 May for a tour of the United States. Debbie finds evidence of Ian's infidelity and confronts him. He promises that the affair is over, but continues to see Annik during the recording of Closer in Islington. Ian suffers a seizure mid-performance and is comforted by Annik, who admits she is falling in love with him. He attempts suicide by overdosing on phenobarbital but doctors save his life. He continues to perform, but is exhausted by the strain and overwhelmed by the audience's expectations. At a performance at the Derby Hall the stress proves too much and he is unable to go onstage. The audience riots when Alan Hempstall  of Crispy Ambulance steps in to cover for Ian, and the gig is ruined. Ian tells Tony that he believes everyone hates him and that it is his own fault. When Debbie learns that Ian is still seeing Annik, she demands a divorce. Bernard attempts to use hypnotherapy on Ian, who then goes to stay with his parents. He writes to Annik admitting his fear that his epilepsy will eventually kill him, and confesses that he loves her. On 17 May 1980, two nights before Joy Division is due to depart for America, Ian returns home and begs Debbie not to divorce him. When she refuses, he angrily orders her out of the house. After drinking alone and writing Debbie a letter, he has another seizure. Regaining consciousness the following morning, he hangs himself from the clothes line in the kitchen. Debbie discovers his body and staggers into the street, crying for help. The news of Ian's death leaves the remaining Joy Division members stunned, while Tony consoles Annik.

Although he is of legitimate birth, he is an ill-natured fellow with plenty of hypocritical 'virtue' but none of Tom's warmth, honesty, or high spirits. When Bridget dies unexpectedly, Blifil intercepts a letter which his mother intended for her brother's eyes only. What this letter contains is not revealed until the end of the movie; however, after his mother's funeral, Blifil and his two tutors, Mr. Thwackum  and Mr. Square ([[John Moffatt , join forces to convince the squire that Tom is a villain. Allworthy gives Tom a small cash legacy and sorrowfully sends him out into the world to seek his fortune. In his road-traveling odyssey, Tom is knocked unconscious while defending the good name of his beloved Sophie and robbed of his legacy. He also flees from a jealous Irishman who falsely accuses him of having an affair with his wife, engages in deadly swordfights, meets his alleged father and his alleged mother, a certain Mrs. Waters, whom he saves from an evil Redcoat Officer, and later beds the same Mrs. Waters. In a celebrated scene, Tom and Mrs. Waters sit opposite each other in the dining room of the Upton Inn, wordlessly consuming an enormous meal while gazing lustfully at each other. Meanwhile, Sophie runs away from home soon after Tom's banishment to escape the attentions of the loathed Blifil. After narrowly missing each other at the Upton Inn, Tom and Sophie arrive separately in London. There, Tom attracts the attention of Lady Bellaston , a promiscuous noblewoman over 40 years of age. She is rich, beautiful, and completely amoral, though it is worth noting that Tom goes to her bed willingly and is generously rewarded for his services. Eventually, Tom ends up at Tyburn Gaol, facing a boisterous hanging crowd after two blackguardly agents of Blifil frame him for robbery and attempted murder. Allworthy learns the contents of the mysterious letter: Tom is not Jenny Jones's child, but Bridget's illegitimate son and Allworthy's nephew. Furthermore, since Blifil knew this, concealed it, and tried to destroy his half-brother, he is now in disgrace and disinherited. Allworthy uses this knowledge to get Tom a pardon, but Tom has already been conveyed to the gallows; his hanging is begun, but is interrupted by Squire Western, who cuts him down and takes him to Sophie. Tom now has permission to court Sophie, and all ends well with Tom embracing Sophie with Squire Western's blessing. In its original release, the film ran 2 hours and 37 minutes.based on novel or book rags to riches sword fight breaking the fourth wall tutor english countryside 18th century squire bawdy",False,tt0057590,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,37600000,0,0,36.6,14.350482420740235,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,50162.0,15.0,834332.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,834332.0,50162.0,1.875,1.0,78820932.06047031

The Allied advance is being slowed by overextended supply lines. A Dutch family, part of the Dutch resistance underground, observes the German withdrawal toward Germany. The Germans in the Netherlands have few resources in men or equipment and morale is very poor. U.S. General George S. Patton and British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery have competing plans for ending the war quickly, and being the first to get to Berlin. Under political pressure, Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower chose Montgomery's Operation Market Garden. Operation Market Garden envisions 35,000 men being flown 300 miles from air bases in England and being dropped as much as 64 miles behind enemy lines in the Netherlands. The largest airborne assault ever attempted, with Lieutenant-General Frederick Browning saying, ""We're going to lay a carpet, as it were, of airborne troops""00:11:37,480 frames 93/94 over which armoured divisions of XXX Corps can pass and confidently suggests that ""We shall seize the bridges - it's all a question of bridges - with thunderclap surprise, and hold them until they can be secured"".00:11:41,280 frames 94/95 Two divisions of U.S. paratroopers are responsible for securing the road and bridges as far as Nijmegen. A British division, under Major-General Urquhart is to land near Arnhem, and take and hold the far side of the bridge at Arnhem, backed by Polish paratroopers under General Sosabowski. XXX Corps are to push up the road to Arnhem, as quickly as possible, over the bridges captured by the paratroopers, and reach Arnhem two days after the drop. After the Market Garden command briefing, General Sosabowski voices his deep doubts that the plan can work. American commander General Gavin worries about parachuting in daylight. British commanders brief that they are badly short of transport aircraft and the area near Arnhem is ill-suited for a landing. They will have to land in an open area eight miles  from the bridge. The British officers present at that briefing do not question the orders, but Sosabowski walks up to check the RAF briefing officer's uniform insignia and says ""Just making sure whose side you're on."" Later, when General Urquhart briefs his officers, some of them are surprised they are going to attempt a landing so far from the bridge, but they have to make the best of it. General Urquhart tells them that the key for the eight mile distance from the drop zone to the bridge, is the use of gliders to bring in Jeeps. Browning lays out that if any one group fails, the entire operation fails. The consensus among the British top brass is that resistance will consist entirely of ""Hitler Youth or old men"",00:17:21,120 frames 177/178 but young British intelligence officer, Major Fuller, brings reconnaissance photos to General Browning showing German tanks at Arnhem. Browning dismisses the photos, and also ignores reports from the Dutch underground. Browning does not want to be the one to tell Montgomery of any doubts because many previous airborne operations have been cancelled. Major Fuller's concerns are brushed off and he is removed from duty. British officers note that the portable radios are not likely to work for the long distance from the drop zone to the Arnhem Bridge amid the water and trees of the Netherlands. They choose not to rock the boat and do not convey their concerns up the chain of command. At the XXX Corps briefing, the overall plan is outlined by Horrocks, laying out the bridges that will be taken by the paratroopers, held and then secured by ground forces. Speed is the vital factor, as Arnhem must be reached within 2–3 days. It is the crucial bridge, the last means of escape for the German forces in the Netherlands and an excellent route to Germany for Allied forces. The road to Arnhem is only a single highway linking the various key bridges - trucks and tanks have to squeeze to the shoulder to pass. The road is also elevated causing anything moving on the road to stand out.  The airborne drops catch the Germans totally by surprise, and there is little resistance. Most of the men come down safely and assemble quickly, but the Son bridge is blown up by the Germans. Model, thinking that the Allies are trying to capture him, panics and retreats from Arnhem. However, soon after landing, troubles beset Urquhart's division. Many of the Jeeps either don't arrive by gliders at all or are shot up in an ambush. Their radio sets are also useless, meaning no contact can be made with either paratroopers moving into Arnhem or XXX Corps. Meanwhile, German forces reinforce Nijmegen and Arnhem. XXX Corps' progress is slowed by German resistance, the narrowness of the highway and the need to construct a Bailey bridge to replace the destroyed bridge at Son. The XXX Corps is able to move onto the Graves bridge without much resistance, but is halted at Nijmegen. There, soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division perform a dangerous daylight river crossing in flimsy canvas-and-wood assault boats. Ultimately though, the river crossing is successful, and the Nijmegen bridge is captured. The Germans close in on the isolated British paratroopers occupying part of Arnhem at the bridge. Urquhart is separated from his men, and the supply drop zones are overrun by the Germans. German attacks on the paratroopers at the bridge are repelled. British armour continues to fight its way up the corridor, but is delayed by strong German resistance.  After securing Nijmegen Bridge, XXX Corps waits several hours for its infantry forces to finish securing the town. Finally Sosabowski's troops enter the battle. They attempt to reinforce the British in Arnhem, but fail. With the Germans fully alert, they gun down several Poles during their drop. They are only able to get a few men across to reinforce the British. After days of house-to-house fighting in Arnhem, with paratroops versus crack SS infantry and panzers, many of the paratroopers are either captured or forced to withdraw, and the city is indiscriminately razed to the ground. The dialogue between Frost and Bittrich's adjutant requesting surrender, and getting a reply the paratroopers do not have the facilities to accept German surrender, never took place. Instead Brigadeführer Heinz Harmel, commander of the 10th SS Panzer Division, selected a British prisoner, Sergeant Stanley Halliwell, and sent him into the British perimeter to request that Frost surrender his forces. After arriving, Halliwell explained what Harmel wants; Frost gave Halliwell a message for Harmel to “Go to hell.”, as is portrayed in the film. Halliwell then told Frost, “If it’s all the same to you, Colonel, I’ll stay. Jerry [the Germans] will get the message sooner or later.” - p.356, Arthur Operation Market Garden has failed. Urquhart manages to escape capture with fewer than two thousand of his troops, the remainder are forced to stay behind and give themselves up. Urquhart confronts Browning about his personal feeling about the operation, which was determined to have been 90% successful by a satisfied Montgomery. When asked if he thinks the operations went well, Browning replies ""Well, as you know, I always felt we tried to go a bridge too far"" .netherlands world war ii bridge allies army based on a true story mission tank soldier 1940s",False,tt0075784,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,50750000,0,0,1.306818181818182,16.09921713605479,79394534.66666667,84740368.0,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,4500000.0,13.0,8000000.0,1.0,76086852.375,15.0,80349977.375,8.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,36600000.0,37600000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1051794.0,3251794.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,36600000.0,37600000.0,1.0,135695658.0,141195658.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,46766673.5,55266673.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,44174988.6875,40293426.1875,3.5,4.5,77361929.38708472

The only survivor is a boy named Quinn Abercromby  whose mother, Karen , was crew chief on the project. She is crushed while protecting Quinn as the dragon makes its way to the surface. The dragon flies out and more dragons begin appearing, multiplying rapidly. It is shown through various newspaper clippings and a voice-over that scientists discovered that dragons are a lost species that are responsible for the dinosaurs' extinction by burning them all to ash. The speculation was that dragons instinctively hibernate after destroying most of the earth's living creatures, waiting until the Earth repopulates. In the months and years following the awakening of the dragons, humanity tried to resist using their combined military might, including nuclear weapons in 2010, but this only hastened the planet's destruction, and within a few years, human civilization worldwide was almost entirely wiped out. One decade later, in 2020, Quinn  leads a community of survivors living in a castle in Northumberland. The survivors are starving, though, while waiting for their crops to ripen. While many trust Quinn's leadership, some are becoming restless and openly defiant. While everyone is asleep, Eddie ([[David Kennedy  steals a truck to take his group to harvest tomatoes. Picking the crops too early won't allow the seeds to germinate so they can be used the next season. The group is attacked by a lone dragon, one is killed and the rest are surrounded by fire. They are rescued by Quinn, Creedy , and Jared  using old fire engines and firesuits. But while trying to escape, the dragon kills Eddie's son, who was manning a water cannon. Later, a group of Americans, the Kentucky Irregulars, arrive, led by Denton Van Zan , including a Chieftain tank and an Agusta A109 helicopter, piloted by Alex Jensen . Van Zan and his heavily armed soldiers have an elaborate tracking system to hunt dragons. Quinn is initially distrustful and surprised that anyone can kill dragons. After an intense discussion, Van Zan convinces Quinn to cooperate. Working together, Quinn and Van Zan kill the dragon that destroyed the crops. The inhabitants of the castle celebrate, only to be chastised by Van Zan, who lost three men in the hunt. Later, Van Zan tells Quinn that all the dragons they have encountered have been female. They have also found that all females carry unfertilized eggs and that their metabolism is so high that they live only a few months. The Americans believe there is only one male and that if they kill it the species will be unable to reproduce. Quinn knows about the male dragon since it is the one that killed his mother. He refuses to help since the male has attacked and destroyed any group who went after it before. Van Zan orders his soldiers to conscript the best men at the castle. Quinn becomes enraged and attacks Van Zan, but loses the fight. Quinn announces that if Van Zan's group finds the male it will kill them and backtrack to the castle. Ignoring Quinn, Van Zan's group head to London, but the male finds them and attacks them on the road, killing most of the soldiers. The male then finds the castle and kills most of the castle's residents. Some survive in the underground bunker. Quinn tries to get more people to safety but Creedy stops him and goes in his place, but is killed when the male attacks for a second time. Van Zan and Jensen return to the castle and free the residents trapped in the bunker. Quinn tells Van Zan he'll help them hunt the male in London, which is the main nesting ground. Quinn knows the male's nest is near the construction site where his mother was killed. They fly to London, where they find hundreds of dragons. They witness the smaller dragons being cannibalized by the much larger male. Van Zan's plan is to fire a magnesium and C-4 explosive charge with a crossbow bolt down the dragon's throat during the brief moment it opens its mouth to inhale and breathe out fire. Van Zan fires but the male destroys the arrow before it can hit. Knowing he's missed, Van Zan jumps off the building to attack the male with his giant axe, but is caught in mid-air and eaten. Quinn and Alex lure the dragon to street level, where Quinn is able to fire his own explosive crossbow bolt into the dragon's mouth, killing it. Quinn and Alex are later seen sitting on a sunny hill overlooking the North Sea, Quinn telling her there have been no dragon sightings for over three months. They are there to erect a radio tower. Jared rides up to tell them they have made radio contact with another group of survivors in France, who wish to speak to their leader. Quinn tells Jared he is now the leader and sends him back to talk to the French. Quinn then announces his dedication to rebuilding. He views the possibility of the dragons' return as remote; he says that, if they ever return, ""They'll burn. We'll build.

It chronicles his determination to rise from his working class Italian-American roots as Walden Robert Cassotto, a frail Bronx boy plagued by multiple bouts of rheumatic fever, and become a singer more famous than Frank Sinatra. To achieve that goal, he forms a band and struggles to find gigs at any nightclub that will hire him. His agent gets Darin a recording contract with Atlantic Records, where the singer enjoys teen idol success with ""Splish Splash"". Not wanting to limit his appeal to rock and roll audiences, he changes his niche to big band singing and records major hits, such as ""Mack the Knife."" To capitalize on his popularity with teenage and young adult audiences, Darin is cast in Come September opposite Sandra Dee. He falls in love with the 18-year-old actress and, determined to marry her, he woos her with songs like ""Beyond the Sea"" and ""Dream Lover."" The two finally elope, angering her mother. Darin finally realizes his own mother's dream when he is signed to appear at the famed Copacabana nightclub in Manhattan. As his success takes him on the road and away from home, Dee begins to drink heavily, and the couple fights frequently. Eventually they separate, then later reconcile. She gives birth to their son Dodd, and Darin is nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as a shell shocked soldier in Captain Newman, M.D. When Darin becomes involved in the campaign to elect Robert F. Kennedy for President and contemplates a political career of his own, his sister Nina, knowing his past will be investigated closely if he opts to enter the political arena, shocks him with the news his beloved mother actually was his grandmother and he is Nina's illegitimate child, the son of a father she can't identify. Devastated, Darin becomes a recluse living in a trailer on the Big Sur coast in California. He finds himself out of step with changing music trends, and when he tries to adapt by incorporating folk music and protest songs into his repertoire, he finds himself rejected by the audience that once embraced him. Undaunted, he stages a show, complete with a gospel choir, at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, and against all odds it is a huge success. But his triumph is short-lived - suffering with blood poisoning following surgery to repair his mechanical heart valve, he's rushed to the hospital, where he dies at the age of 37. Following his death, he meets the younger counterpart of himself once again, and the two duet with ""As Long as I'm Singing.""musical perfectionist rowboat courtship",False,tt0363473,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,8292914,0,0,-1.894037005568851,1.9257596443831189,,,,,,,-4364631.0,3,44635369.0,2.0,,0.0,,,16816792.25,13.0,31191792.25,4.0,-2486443.714285714,22.0,24227842.0,7.0,13678335.666666666,8.0,20511669.0,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-9109682.5,890317.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12339898.5,21839898.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,30141668.0625,5911013.300595238,5.75,4.0,84824632.31357588

The obvious choice seems to be Virginian Governor Jack Hathaway , who is hailed as a hero after he recently dove into a lake in a failed attempt to save a drowning girl. The president opts not to choose Hathaway, claiming that the administration cannot afford another Chappaquiddick. The President instead decides that his ""swan song"" will be helping to break the glass ceiling. He nominates Laine Hanson , a talented senator from Ohio who is a Republican-turned-Democrat. Standing in her way is Republican Congressman Shelley Runyon  of Illinois, who believes she is unqualified for the position, and backs Hathaway for the nod. His investigation in her background turns up an incident where she was apparently photographed participating in a drunken orgy as part of a sorority initiation. The confirmation hearings begin in Washington, D.C., and Runyon, who chairs the committee, quickly addresses Hanson's alleged sexual imbroglio. Hanson refuses to address the incident, neither confirming nor denying anything, and tries to turn the discussion towards political issues. Anticipating that Hanson would deem her personal past ""none of anyone's business,"" Runyon starts rumors in the media saying that the sexual escapade in college was done in exchange for money and favors, making it prostitution. Meanwhile, a woman testifies in front of the committee saying that Hanson engaged in a relationship with her then-husband prior to their divorce. Though Hanson is not guilty of adultery, her reputation is further tarnished. Senator Hanson meets with the President and offers to withdraw her name, to save his administration more embarrassment. Despite the wishes of the administration, she refuses to fight back or even address Runyon's charges, arguing that to answer the questions dignifies them being asked in the first place—something she does not believe. The President meets with Runyon, informing him he will not choose Hanson as Vice President. Runyon casually brings forward Governor Hathaway as a replacement. They make an agreement that Runyon will back down on his attacks if the President chooses Hathaway as Vice President. However, the President requests Runyon to make a public statement defending Hathaway. Hanson, Hathaway and Runyon are all invited to the White House. The president then shocks them by showing a FBI report that proves Hathaway paid the woman to drive off the bridge into the lake. It was part of a plan to increase his approval ratings and become the obvious choice for VP. Hathaway is arrested and Runyon is disgraced because he vouched for Hathaway's integrity just hours earlier. The president meets with Hanson, and she finally tells of what actually happened that night in college. She did indeed arrive at a fraternity house to have sex with two men as part of an initiation, but changed her mind before any sexual acts occurred. The girl in the photo was actually someone else. Though they have the evidence to vindicate Hanson, she explicitly expresses that a statement not be made, even if it will clear her; citing that by doing so will further the idea that it was acceptable to ask the questions in the first place. The president addresses all of Congress and uses Runyon's predicament as a way to gather support for Hanson's nomination.washington d.c. u.s. president sex scandal politics government vice president",False,tt0208874,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,17804273,0,0,0.9782525555555556,-1.1627692044360227,,,,,,,-4698946.0,14,3051054.0,2.0,,0.0,,,11059587.0,2.0,23559587.0,2.0,-50129433.0,2.0,19870567.0,1.0,8864985.0,22.0,11364985.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14461548.25,-8725951.75,5.0,1.5,76394553.2193505

The gregarious Roy befriends their cabin mates, a Spanish man, Carlos ([[Eduardo Noriega , travelling with his young Seattle-born girlfriend, Abby . The reserved Jessie does not share her husband's warmth towards the globe trotting pair. In course of the journey, Carlos shows Jessie a collection of ""rare"" souvenir matryoshka dolls he is carrying. When Roy misses the train in Irkutsk while sightseeing, Jessie is left alone with Carlos and Abby. Jessie gets off the train at Ilanskaya station, about 400 miles further, to wait for Roy to arrive in another train. Carlos and Abby get off with her, claiming she would not be safe alone. In a restaurant, Jessie sees dolls nearly identical to the ones that Carlos showed her. Abby is upset when she mentions this and goes off to bed. Jessie begs Carlos not to involve Abby in his suspicious activities. The next morning Carlos comes to Jessie's room, tells her that his shower is not working and asks to use her bathroom. Jessie receives a call from the reception desk and leaves Carlos alone in her room. At the reception she later receives a telephone call confirming that Roy will rejoin her at 4 o'clock, and Carlos convinces her to accompany him on a trek into the middle of a snowy wilderness, where they come upon the ruins of an abandoned church. Jessie, an amateur photographer, starts taking pictures of the old church. When Carlos makes advances at first she surrenders and the two begin kissing, but she comes to her senses and asks him to stop. When he continues and chases her, she becomes terrified and beats him to death with a fence post, then returns to the railway station and rejoins Roy on the train. Ilya Grinko , an inquisitive Russian narcotics officer whom Roy previously befriended, is the new cabin mate of Roy and Jessie. Jessie finds Carlos' dolls in her own suitcase and realizes that Carlos must have hidden them when he was in her room that morning. In the course of a conversation with Grinko about his police work, Jessie realizes that Carlos was smuggling heroin in the dolls, and she unsuccessfully tries to get rid of them. She panics when Grinko becomes suspicious and confronts her. When she returns to her cabin to find Roy examining the dolls, she breaks down and explains their origins to Roy, though without telling him about Carlos' death. The two of them surrender the dolls to Grinko, who at first seems satisfied that they were not involved in the smuggling operation. The next morning, however, she and Roy awake to discover that most of the train's cars are now gone along with the passengers; only Grinko and his partner Kolzak Yushenkov  remain. Grinko and Kolzak stop the train in the middle of nowhere and take Jessie and Roy to an abandoned military bunker, where Abby is being tortured. Grinko is on the payroll of a Russian drug lord and explains that, in addition to the heroin, he wants the money that Carlos carried, which belongs to the drug lord. Grinko tells Jessie that Abby is not a ""good girl"" as Jessie had thought: Abby recruited Carlos, was responsible for another man's death and is trying to cheat the drug lord of his money. Jessie disbelieves Grinko because Carlos told her Abby was innocent. Jessie and Roy escape with the train because Roy, a railway enthusiast, knows how to operate a locomotive, but the train starts to slow down and Grinko and Kolzak are able to re-board the train. When the pair question Jessie once again about Carlos' whereabouts while holding her and Roy at gunpoint, Jessie comes clean and screams that she killed Carlos. Kolzak however does not believe her, but before they can do anything else, the train has a head-on collision with another train. With the police on the way, Grinko shoots Kolzak to maintain his cover that he is on the right side of the law, claiming to have rescued Jessie and Roy from Kolzak. The couple are taken away by the police, while Grinko escapes. In Moscow, U.S. officials visit Jessie and Roy. Through a photograph Jessie took of Grinko and his associates, the officials believe it will be easy to shut down the drug operation. They reveal Carlos' criminal history and believe Abby just got mixed up with the wrong crowd. When signing statements, Jessie never tells the officials that she killed Carlos, although Roy may have heard her admit to this when the train was about to crash. Upon touring Moscow and seeing a billboard of a girl sitting on the end of a dock , Jessie insists on talking to Abby in the hospital. The final scene shows a still-limping Abby finding Carlos's body in the snow by the old church. Earlier, she had revealed to Jessie that she was ""working"" on finding money to buy back her grandfather's cottage on the lake in Vancouver. She takes the stolen money from his jacket and walks away.china married couple backpacker firearm police travel snow blood cowardliness train drugs killer siberia moscow trans-siberian railway",False,tt0800241,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,5926410,0,0,-1.5310432454048908,-1.6278585820155915,,,,,,,,0,,,33203187.0,5.0,43903187.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,84733706.0,6.0,124733706.0,2.0,-12669562.0,26.0,29047104.666666668,6.0,,0.0,,,-42165135.0,2.0,17834865.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3203235.0,8203235.0,1.0,,,,12451113.833333334,63284447.166666664,6.0,-4067329.0,432671.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3203235.0,8203235.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,3203235.0,8203235.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,53879715.666666664,15775549.0,4.875,2.75,95612307.5388973

Her husband sends an independent cattle drover , called ""Drover"", to transport her to Faraway Downs. Lady Sarah's husband is murdered shortly before she arrives, and the authorities tell her that the killer is an Aboriginal elder, ""King George"" . Meanwhile, cattle station manager Neil Fletcher  is trying to gain control of Faraway Downs, so that Lesley 'King' Carney  will have a complete cattle monopoly, giving him negotiating leverage with an Australian army officer, Captain Dutton . The childless Lady Sarah is captivated by the boy Nullah , who has an Aboriginal mother and a white father. Nullah tells her that he has seen her cattle being driven onto Carney's land — in other words, stolen from her. Because of this Fletcher mistreats Nullah and threatens him and his mother, so Lady Sarah fires Fletcher and decides to try to run the cattle station herself. When Nullah and his mother hide from the authorities in a water tower, his mother drowns. Lady Sarah comforts Nullah by singing the song ""Over the Rainbow"" from the film The Wizard of Oz. Nullah tells her that ""King George"" is his grandfather, and that like the Wizard, he too is a ""magic man"". Lady Sarah persuades Drover to take the cattle to Darwin for sale. Drover is friendly with the Aborigines, and therefore shunned by many of the other whites in the territory. It is revealed that he was married to an Aboriginal woman, who died after being refused medical treatment in a hospital because of her race. Lady Sarah also reveals she is barren. Drover leads a team of six other riders, including Lady Sarah, Drover's Aboriginal brother-in-law Magarri , Nullah, and the station's accountant Kipling Flynn ([[Jack Thompson , to drive the 1,500 cattle to Darwin. They encounter various obstacles along the way, including a fire set by Carney's men that scares the cattle, resulting in the death of Flynn when the group tries to stop the cattle from stampeding over a cliff. Lady Sarah and Drover fall in love, and she gains a new appreciation for the Australian territory. The team drive the cattle through the dangerous Never Never desert. Then, when at last delivering the cattle in Darwin, the group has to race them onto the ship before Carney's cattle are loaded. Afterwards, Lady Sarah, Nullah, and Drover live together happily at Faraway Downs for two years. Meanwhile, Fletcher kills Carney, marries his daughter Cath Carney, takes over Carney's cattle empire, and continues to menace Lady Sarah. It is established that Fletcher was the actual murderer of Lady Sarah's husband, and is also Nullah's father. Nullah is drawn to perform a walkabout with his grandfather ""King George"", but is instead taken by the authorities and sent to live on Mission Island (a fictitious island, but inspired by [[Bathurst Island  with the other half-Aboriginal children . Lady Sarah, who has come to regard Nullah as her adopted son, vows to rescue him. Meanwhile, she works as a radio operator in Darwin during the escalation of World War II. When the Japanese attack the island and Darwin in 1942, Lady Sarah fears that Nullah has been killed. Drover, who had quarrelled with Lady Sarah and left, returns to Darwin and hears  that she has been killed in the bombing. Drover learns of Nullah's abduction to Mission Island, and goes with Magarri and a young priest to rescue him and the other children. Meanwhile, Lady Sarah is about to evacuate, but when Drover and the children sail back into port at Darwin, and Nullah plays ""Over the Rainbow"" on his harmonica, Lady Sarah hears the music and the three are reunited. Fletcher, distraught at the ruination of his plans, attempts to shoot Nullah, but is speared by King George and falls dead. Lady Sarah, Drover, and Nullah return to the safety of remote Faraway Downs.

Kazim sends men to kill them and the NUMA team, not realizing their CIA and Navy background. Dirk, Al and Rudi survive the attack. Rudi tries to get out of the country to get help while Dirk and Al go to rescue the doctors. They save Eva, and then the three try to get across the border, but are captured by Tuareg, who are fighting the civil war against Kazim. The Tuaregs’ leader, Madibo, shows Eva his people, who are dying from the same disease she was investigating at the beginning. After taking samples, Eva finds that their water is contaminated. By accident, Al stumbles into a cave with a painting showing the ironclad Texas. Dirk believes that the Texas became stranded when the river water dried up after a storm and that the same river that carried the Texas now runs underground, spreading the contamination. They start to follow the dry river bed and work their way to the border. Dirk still hopes to find the ironclad along the way. Their plans are interrupted when they stumble upon the solar detoxification plant owned by Massarde, and realize that it is the source of the contamination. Rudi and Sandecker analyze their samples and find that the contamination is heading down the Niger River to the ocean, but they can't get any government help to intervene during a civil war in a sovereign country. Massarde captures Dirk and the others. He keeps Eva but sends Dirk and Al to Kazim. They escape but end up stranded in the middle of the desert. They find the wreck of a plane and fashion it into a land yacht which they use to find civilisation and contact Sandecker, who warns them that Kazim and his troops are after them. Dirk and Al enlist Madibo's aid to return to the plant and rescue Eva. He helps them infiltrate the plant and rescue his people who are working there as slaves. Rather than risk discovery, Massarde plans to destroy the plant, making it almost impossible to stop the contamination. Al goes to defuse the bombs while Dirk tries to head off Massarde. After a battle with a corrupt Tuareg, Dirk manages to save Eva while Massarde escapes. Dirk, Eva, and Al get away from the plant, but are strafed by Kazim in a helicopter gunship. A series of explosions along the dry river bed reveals the wreckage of the Texas, right where the cave painting showed it to be. They take cover inside thinking the ironclad's armor will protect them but Kazim's armor-piercing ammunition penetrates the rusted ironclad's armor with ease. They manage to fight back with an old cannon and destroy Kazim's gunship, just as Madibo arrives with Tuareg reinforcements which forces Kazim's army to surrender and end the civil war. In the end the contamination is dealt with, and Sandecker is offered a deal to do some covert work, while the government serendipitously funds NUMA, which he accepts, tentatively. It seems that Massarde, busy eating with a businessman, does not notice that the waiter  who pours him water from a bottle  served ONLY HIM and then disappeared with the rest of the bottle. It is implied that Massarde is poisoned  on orders from the US Government. The Texas gold, which belongs to the CSA &ndash; Confederate States of America, is left with Madibo's people. We see a soccer ball come bouncing into the same cave with the painting of the ironclad Texas, with Al in pursuit. He is playing soccer with the local kids. The cave, once empty, is now full of the gold. Later, while Al, Rudi, Sandecker are busy, Dirk and Eva are at the beach at her house on the bay in Monterey.civil war africa based on novel or book beach treasure ship car chase desert explorer tyrant ironclad ship",False,tt0318649,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,119269486,0,0,-0.08996864462046897,-2.6760407675788414,-37821105.0,72178895.0,-4931553.933333334,41468446.06666667,,,22150183.0,3,82150183.0,1.0,-915885.0,4.0,31334115.0,2.0,,0.0,,,53611975.0,9.0,60611975.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,106943107.5,194443107.5,2.0,,,,7602759.0,41352759.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,27894717.4,76094717.4,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23625736.0,96125736.0,2.0,,,,,,,204931766.0,244931766.0,1.0,,,,-13433539.0,12566461.0,2.0,106455534.0,169455534.0,2.0,,,,177905199.4,239265199.4,5.0,,,,17126295.0,47126295.0,1.0,,,,128206782.5,199456782.5,4.0,,,58032091.0,24948757.666666668,2.0,1.3333333333333333,109858494.28372188

Mrs. Tweedy serves as the genius but high-tempered wife of Mr. Tweedy, who is rather slow and timid, but handles his manual work industriously. The coop is run in the style of a World War II POW camp, with the chickens accountable for the number of eggs they lay daily. One chicken, Ginger, who is often treated as the chickens' leader, has attempted numerous plans to flee the coop, aided by contraband smuggled in by two rats, Nick and Fetcher. However, Ginger is routinely captured by Mr. Tweedy and his dogs, and is thrown into a coal bin for solitary confinement numerous times. Ginger is finally released from the coal bin just in time for roll call the next day. Mrs. Tweedy finds on her clipboard that a chicken named Edwina had not laid any eggs. With that, Mrs. Tweedy grabs Edwina and takes her to ""the chop"". Mrs. Tweedy beheads Edwina with a hatchet and cooks her for dinner. Ginger becomes increasingly desperate to find a plan of escape which will work, faces problems with Nick and Fetcher, who are tired of being paid with chicken feed and want eggs instead. Meanwhile, Mrs. Tweedy realizes that the couple's farm is failing, and reads a catalogue on an ambiguous method of increasing profits at the couple's farm. Ginger, realizing something is wrong, attempts to convince herself and the other chickens to speed up their efforts to escape. However, Ginger soon comes to the conclusion that the only escape route is to go over the fence, something Ginger and the other chickens cannot do. Later that same night, as Ginger sits outside, she sees a Rhode Island Red cockerel that seemingly flies over the fence and accidentally crashes into the coop. The other chicken fawn over the new arrival, who introduces himself as Rocky, while Ginger finds the first half of a poster with a picture of Rocky on it; showing it to the other chickens and explaining how Rocky came in, Ginger claims that Rocky can fly. Upon discovering that Rocky is from a circus, Ginger agrees to hide Rocky from his owners if he teaches them how to fly. Rocky reluctantly agrees, but due to injuring his wing as a result of his landing, he cannot show them immediately. Instead, Rocky puts Ginger and the other chickens through a set of exercises that seem to have no purpose while assuring them that all the chickens are making progress. Meanwhile, a large pie-making machine arrives, which Mr. Tweedy begins assembling. At the same time, Mrs. Tweedy orders food rations doubled. Ginger proclaims that their intent is to fatten them up, and then kill them, only for Rocky to drag her off. The two of them argue, Rocky claiming that Ginger's honesty will demoralize the chickens, and Ginger refusing to lie to the other hens. Discovering that the chickens have gone into depression following Ginger's announcement, Rocky organizes a party using a radio obtained by Nick and Fetcher, and he and Ginger grow closer whilst dancing. During the party, Rocky's arm is shown to have healed. Once the pie machine is complete, the Tweedys kidnap Ginger for its first test. Rocky follows Ginger into the machine and eventually rescues her, damaging the machine and giving Rocky and Ginger more time to work on their escape. Fowler, an older cockerel who has been doubting of Rocky's acts, gives him his respect for rescuing Ginger and his old Royal Air Force  badge in tribute. Rocky decides to flee the farm the next day, leaving behind Fowler's medal and the second half of his poster, showing that he was actually a stunt cockerel, only ""flying"" by being shot out of a cannon. This revelation outrages the other chickens, and a fight soon breaks out as morale falls. When Fowler arrives to try and restore order, he begins talking of his days in the RAF, leading Ginger to realize that she and the other chickens can build a plane made from Fowler's pictures and personal recollections. Supplied by Nick and Fetcher, the chickens race against time to assemble their plane as the Tweedys work to repair the pie machine. The chickens finally finish their plane just as Mr. Tweedy unexpectedly completes all the repairs of the pie machine and enters the coop to grab all the chickens. However, the chickens launch an open revolt, tying up and gagging Mr. Tweedy and readying the plane. As the chickens prepare for take-off, Mr. Tweedy ends up freeing himself and knocks down the ramp used to get the plane airborne. Ginger jumps down while Fowler turns the plane around, which knocks Mr. Tweedy unconscious. As Ginger struggles to lift the ramp, Mrs. Tweedy arrives and attempts to kill Ginger with her used hatchet. However, Rocky, having had a change of heart, jumps over the fence aboard his tricycle and hits Mrs. Tweedy in her face, briefly knocking her senseless. Rocky and Ginger grab onto the string of lights caught on the plane's landing gear as the plane takes off, but Mrs. Tweedy soon awakens and also grabs the lights, weighing down the plane. Ginger heads down the string to cut it, but accidentally loses her scissors. Realizing what is the only way left to cut the lights, Ginger manages to trick Mrs. Tweedy into using the hatchet to sever the string, which causes Mrs. Tweedy to fall, crash into the pie machine, and plugging her into the safety valve. This causes the pie machine to build-up pressure and explode in a mushroom cloud of gravy, destroying the barn and covering the entire farm with gravy, leaving only just the barn door standing. The chickens continue to fly to freedom as Mr. Tweedy reminds Mrs. Tweedy: ""I told you they was organized"". Mr. Tweedy later drops the door on top of Mrs. Tweedy before she can lash out on him. In the epilogue, the chickens find their idyllic setting in a bird sanctuary, where they can live in comfort and raise their new chicks. Rocky and Ginger, having fallen in love with each other, become a couple. Meanwhile, Nick and Fetcher discuss their plans of starting their own chicken farm, so they can have all the eggs they could eat. However, Nick and Fetcher ends up arguing with each other over whether the chicken or the egg came first. Their argument ultimately continues during the closing credits and even involves Rocky breaking it up in a post-credits scene.royal air force (raf) chicken northern england freedom yorkshire escape farmer chicken farm pie machine",False,tt0120630,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,224834564,0,0,3.996323644444443,-1.1627692044360227,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,-16386538.0,16.0,8613462.0,1.0,,0.0,,,15787233.0,2.0,21787233.0,1.0,58843409.0,8.0,62548947.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-8902610.666666666,10.0,5264056.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21158161.0,41158161.0,2.0,227840876.0,241590876.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24553424.5,12335373.333333334,4.5,1.5,76394553.2193505

With the exception of newcomer supporting actor Kevin Sandusky , the cast&mdash;fading action hero Tugg Speedman , five-time Academy Award-winning Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus , rapper Alpa Chino , and drug-addicted comedian Jeff Portnoy &mdash;behave unreasonably. Rookie director Damien Cockburn  cannot control them during filming of a large war scene and production is reported to be one month behind schedule. Cockburn is ordered by studio executive Les Grossman  to get filming back on track, or risk its cancellation. Acting on Tayback's advice, Cockburn drops the actors into the middle of the jungle, with hidden cameras and rigged special effects explosions to film ""guerrilla-style"". The actors have guns that fire blanks, along with a map and scene listing that will lead to a helicopter waiting at the end of the route. Unbeknownst to the actors and production, the group have been dropped in the middle of the Golden Triangle, the home of the heroin-producing Flaming Dragon gang. Shortly after the group set off, the five actors are stunned to see Cockburn blown up by an old land mine. Speedman, believing Cockburn faked his death, persuades the others that Cockburn is alive and that they are still shooting the film. Lazarus is unconvinced, but joins them in their trek through the jungle. When Tayback and pyrotechnics operator Cody Underwood  attempt to locate the dead director, they are captured by Flaming Dragon, at which point Tayback reveals that he fabricated his memoir and that he has hands. As the actors continue through the jungle, Lazarus and Sandusky discover that Speedman is leading them in the wrong direction. The four actors, tired of walking and hoping to be rescued, leave Speedman, who goes off by himself and is captured by Flaming Dragon. Taken to their heroin factory, Speedman believes it is a POW camp from the script. The gang discovers he is the star of their favorite film, the box office bomb Simple Jack, and force him to reenact it several times a day. Meanwhile in Los Angeles, Speedman's agent Rick Peck  is trying to negotiate with Grossman an unfulfilled term in Speedman's contract that entitles him to a TiVo. Flaming Dragon calls the two and demands a ransom for Speedman, but Grossman instead berates the gang. Despite the threats, Grossman expresses no interest in rescuing Speedman and attempts to convince Rick about the benefits of allowing Speedman to die and collecting the insurance. Grossman also offers Rick a Gulfstream V and money in return for his cooperation. Lazarus, Chino, Portnoy, and Sandusky discover Flaming Dragon's heroin factory. After seeing Speedman being tortured, they plan a rescue attempt based on the film's script. Lazarus impersonates a farmer towing a captured Portnoy on the back of a water buffalo, distracting the armed guards so Chino and Sandusky can locate the captives. After the gang notices inconsistencies in Lazarus' story, the actors open fire, temporarily subduing them. When the gang realize they are being guarded by actors, they gather their guns and begin firing. The four actors locate Speedman, Tayback, and Underwood, and cross a bridge rigged to explode to get to their helicopter. Speedman asks to remain behind with the gang which he considers his family, but quickly returns when Flaming Dragon fire in pursuit. Tayback detonates the bridge allowing Speedman to reach safety, but as the helicopter takes off, the gang fires an RPG at the helicopter. Rick unexpectedly stumbles out of the jungle carrying a TiVo box and throws it in the path of the RPG, saving them. The crew return to Hollywood, where footage from the hidden cameras is compiled into a feature film, Tropic Blunder, which becomes a major critical and box office hit. The film wins Speedman his first Academy Award, which Lazarus presents to him at the ceremony.movie business vietnam satire jungle movie star southeast asia land mine shackles war filmmaking duringcreditsstinger blackface method acting",False,tt0942385,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,188072649,0,0,1.0442679239130437,-1.6278585820155915,,,,,55836472.666666664,83503139.33333333,464480841.0,2,574480841.0,1.0,-3289090.5,13.0,18810909.5,2.0,45631665.0,8.0,90631665.0,3.0,44046660.0,23.0,88796660.0,2.0,-4036545.3333333335,9.0,15130121.333333334,3.0,-20716169.0,4.0,49783831.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,273531464.0,383531464.0,1.0,-5762530.0,9237470.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,222500000.0,262500000.0,1.0,109168700.0,194168700.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,119051595.5,222051595.5,2.0,235000000.0,435000000.0,1.0,,,,35479076.0,57479076.0,1.0,,,,-1978749.5,31521250.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,139605671.30555555,87686226.8611111,7.375,2.1666666666666665,95612307.5388973

He tries delaying the bulldozers by lying down in front of them. Ford Prefect, a friend of Arthur's, convinces him to go to the pub with him. Over a pint of beer , Ford explains that he is an alien from a planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and a journalist working on the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a universal guide book, and that the Earth is to be demolished later that day by a race called Vogons, in order to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Suddenly, a Vogon Constructor Fleet appears in the sky and destroys the planet. Ford saves himself and Arthur by hitching a ride on a Vogon ship. The two are discovered and thrown out of an airlock, but are picked up by the starship Heart of Gold. They find Ford's ""semi-half brother"" Zaphod Beeblebrox, the President of the Galaxy. He has stolen the ship along with Tricia ""Trillian"" McMillan, an Earth woman whom Arthur had met previously, and Marvin the Paranoid Android. Zaphod explains that he is seeking the planet Magrathea, where he believes he can discover the Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything to match with the answer ""42"" given by the supercomputer Deep Thought. Zaphod stole the Heart of Gold to use its improbability drive to get to Magrathea through trial and error. During one of these attempts they end up on the planet Viltvodle VI. Zaphod decides to visit Humma Kavula, his opponent from the election. Upon learning of Zaphod's plan, Kavula announces that he has the coordinates to Magrathea. He takes one of Zaphod's two heads hostage and demands they bring him the Point-of-view gun created by Deep Thought, which allows the target to understand the shooter's point of view. As they are leaving the planet, Trillian is captured by Vogons. The others travel to rescue her from the Vogon home world bureaucracy, facing long lines and frustrating form processing. Trillian is outraged to learn that Zaphod signed the authorization for the destruction of Earth thinking it was a request for an autograph. The Heart of Gold is chased by the Vogons, led by Galactic Vice-President Questular Rontok, who is attempting to rescue Zaphod from himself. As the Heart of Gold arrives in orbit above Magrathea, Arthur triggers the improbability drive to avoid the automated missile defense systems. The missiles transform into a bowl of petunias and a sperm whale. On the planet, Zaphod, Ford and Trillian take a portal to Deep Thought. When they ask the computer whether it has calculated the ultimate question, it reveals that it designed another supercomputer to do so - Earth. When the trio finds the Point-of-View gun, Trillian shoots Zaphod, making him understand how she feels about the destruction of Earth. She also finds out how much she loves Arthur. Arthur and Marvin miss the portal and encounter a Magrathean called Slartibartfast, who takes Arthur on a tour of the construction floor where Earth Mark II is being built. Slartibartfast takes Arthur home, where the others are enjoying a feast provided by pan-dimensional beings who resemble a pair of mice. Arthur realizes he has fallen into a trap. The mice, who constructed Deep Thought, used the supercomputer to build an even larger supercomputer, the planet Earth, to determine the Ultimate Question. Believing Arthur, the last remaining supercomputer component, may hold the Ultimate Answer, the mice attempt to remove his brain. Arthur kills the mice. As the crew regroup outside the house they are surrounded by Vogons and take shelter in a caravan as the Vogons open fire. Marvin is left outside and shot in the back of the head, and uses the Point-of-View gun on the Vogons, causing them to become depressed and unable to fight.

His agent, Morris Mecklen , discusses a potential immunity deal with FBI Deputy Director Stanley Locke . Agents Richard Messner  and Donald Carruthers  learn that ailing Las Vegas mob boss Primo Sparazza  has issued a bounty on Israel worth one million dollars, and involving a mysterious assassin known only as The Swede, stipulating that he will bring Sparazza Israel's heart. A number of assassins also seek the reward, including Lazlo Soot ([[Tommy Flanagan , who specializes in disguises and impersonations; Sharice Watters  and Georgia Sykes , two hitwomen hired by Sparazza's underboss; Pasquale Acosta , a calm torture expert and mercenary; and the psychotic punks Tremor brothers, Darwin , Jeeves , and Lester . Locke dispatches Messner and Carruthers to take Israel into custody when the deal is struck. Meanwhile, a team of bail bondsmen, Jack Dupree  and his partners, ""Pistol"" Pete Deeks  and Hollis Elmore  have been hired by the firm that posted Israel's bail to bring him into custody. The bondsmen are attacked by the Tremors, and only Elmore escapes alive. Messner is dispatched to the murder scene while Carruthers proceeds to Israel. At the same time, each of the assassins gain access to the hotel in their own various ways. Carruthers encounters Acosta, disguised as a security officer, in an elevator at the hotel. Carruthers senses something is wrong and both are mortally wounded in a gunfight. Meanwhile, Soot gains access to the penthouse by posing as one of Israel's henchmen. Israel's second-in-command, Sir Ivy ([[Common , learns that Israel agreed to inform upon Ivy as part of the plea deal and attempts to kill him, but Israel injures Ivy long enough for the hotel security team to restrain Ivy. Georgia finds Carruthers and Acosta in the elevator, but assumes Acosta is Soot. In Los Angeles, Locke abruptly withdraws from the deal with Israel and orders that Messner and Carruthers are not told. The Tremor brothers reach the penthouse floor, where they engage in a shootout with the security team and Ivy, who manages to kill Jeeves and Lester. Israel, learning of the FBI's new position, attempts suicide. Messner arrives at the hotel and sets up a position around Georgia's elevator. Sharice provides cover from another hotel with a .50-caliber, M82 sniper rifle, outgunning the FBI agents. Acosta, still alive, shoots Georgia, but is shot by Carruthers. Sharice, thinking Georgia is dead, refuses to escape and keeps shooting at the FBI team. Georgia escapes to the penthouse, where she stops Darwin Tremor before he can kill Ivy. Tremor escapes, and Messner, distraught over the death of Carruthers, stops Ivy and Georgia on the stairwell, but lets them escape. Sharice, after seeing the pair alive and free through her rifle scope, is gunned down by the FBI. Locke and a team of FBI agents descend on the penthouse and take Israel to the hospital, while Soot escapes by tearing off his disguise & dressing as a member of hotel security. Acosta, carted away on a gurney, is also shown to be alive. Darwin Tremor tries to escape, but is gunned down by Hollis Elmore. Messner arrives at the hospital and learns the truth about the day's events from Locke. It transpires that the mysterious Swede is a prominent heart surgeon and that Soot was hired by Sparazza to get Israel's heart so it could be transplanted into the body of Sparazza. Sparazza is further revealed to be Freeman Heller , an FBI agent who went undercover and was thought to have been killed by the mob. The FBI had attempted to kill Heller, after they thought his assignment had blurred the lines between being a mobster or an FBI agent. But Heller survived and ended up taking on the role as Sparazza full-time. The mobster has agreed to expose the mob's operations in exchange for Israel's heart as he is Sparazza's love child and, thus, the most compatible donor. Messner, furious over the unnecessary deaths, especially Carruthers', protests and is ordered by Locke to leave the hospital and go home to Washington, D.C, as he is no longer on the case. Realizing that the FBI will never admit what they did, he walks into the emergency room, locks the door and pulls the plug on both men. He then lays his gun and badge on the floor while Locke and his men desperately try to break in, apparently resigning as an FBI agent.neo nazism gun sniper fbi hitman bodyguard gangster to shoot dead police dark comedy shootout drugs female corpse",False,tt0475394,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,57103895,1,0,2.3590526470588244,-3.847336948521819,72799583.47222222,110924583.47222222,94494203.1,117501603.1,40126166.28571428,70283309.14285715,,0,,,264692268.0,5.0,351692268.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,124167015.0,17.0,156167015.0,1.0,,0.0,,,264317794.0,8.0,289317794.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,-7371596.5,87628403.5,2.0,,,,,,,43556623.333333336,59556623.333333336,3.0,10189336.666666666,34689336.666666664,6.0,,,,,,,15692101.0,70692101.0,1.0,,,,87883824.0625,119750074.0625,16.0,,,,,,,33482869.5,46857869.5,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,265725692.33333334,217725692.33333334,3.75,1.0,92887866.92008553

Alice defeats obstacles she had encountered or watched being encountered in the first film, though she is eventually killed by a bouncing mine. Her body is dumped into a pit that is full of Alice clones. The camera zooms out from the underground facility's camouflaged entrance. Despite all the Umbrella activities and attempts to quarantine and sanitize Raccoon City, the virus managed to leave the quarantine, and it has spread around the world. As organisms were infected, the environment became destroyed. Umbrella has placed facilities underground to prevent the human survivors from finding out about Umbrella's experiments. Five years after the spread, the rest of the world eventually turned into deserted wastelands. Meanwhile, the original Alice wanders the deserts of the Southwestern U.S. She has separated from the rest of her group for their own protection, as Umbrella is tracking her and she is afraid that they will kill anyone linked to her. She searches for supplies and travels on a motorcycle. Alice hears a call for help during this and goes to investigate, only to discover it is some survivors playing a cruel joke. They catch her and a man starts trying to sexually assault her. She warns him not to touch her, but he just slaps her, so she kicks him, killing him. Another man knocks her out. She wakes in a pit, and the sadistic survivors force her to face zombie dogs but she defeats them, also collapsing the ground, allowing the dogs to get up to the survivors and kill them. Alice escapes, unhurt. In the Umbrella facility, Dr. Sam Isaacs  considers Alice's re-capture a top priority since she has the ability to bond with the T-virus. He tries to persuade the Umbrella board that he can use her blood to develop a permanent cure, as well as tame the infected. The new Umbrella chairman Albert Wesker  refuses the re-capture, and orders Isaacs to use the clones to create a cure, with no authorization to recapture Alice until they are aware of her location and ability to capture her. Meanwhile, Claire Redfield's  convoy, which includes the Raccoon City survivors Carlos Olivera  and Lloyd ""L.J."" Jefferson Wade , along with new survivors K-Mart , Mikey ([[Chris Egan , Chase  and Nurse Betty ([[Ashanti  along with others, travels cross-country, looking for medical supplies, food, water, gas, and permanent shelter. One day, in a deserted town, while searching for supplies, L.J. is bitten, but keeps it a secret. The next morning, the convoy is attacked by infected crows, whom Claire deduces were feeding on the infected flesh. The crows almost overpower the convoy, killing Nurse Betty and taking out the flamethrower operator, causing the weapon to careen out of control. Alice appears and saves Carlos and others. She uses her psionic powers to cover the sky with a blanket of fire from the flamethrower, killing the remaining crows. But after that she passes out, having pushed her powers to the limit. Carlos catches her, holding her close, hinting that they may become close. She comes round later, safe with the covoy and being watched over by K-Mart. She is introduced to Claire, giving her a diary she found. The book claims there is a ""safe zone"" in Alaska. Alice and Carlos convince Claire to take her convoy to Alaska. They agree to go to Las Vegas to search for supplies for their trip to Alaska. Meanwhile, in the facility, Dr. Isaacs' attempts to domesticate the infected have led to a new zombie breed. Wesker's security officer, Captain Slater , is adamant about Isaacs not disregarding Umbrella's regulations. Slater does admit that the ""super zombies""  would be useful, but reiterates that Isaacs is out of control with his new horde, and he is losing his mind trying to re-capture Alice. Umbrella triangulates Alice's location based on her psionic abilities. Dr. Isaacs has a crate of his new zombies sent to ambush the convoy, against Wesker's orders. Most of the convoy, including Chase and Mikey, are killed in the ambush and Carlos is infected by L.J. as he turns. Umbrella tries to shut Alice down remotely, but she breaks free from their programming and continues to fight. She finds and kills the Umbrella team at the scene and Isaacs becomes infected as he flees. Alice and K-Mart use Isaacs' computer to track the helicopter's flight path, leading to Umbrella's underground location. The convoy arrives at the site, which is surrounded by infected. Carlos begins to slowly succumb to the virus, and he sacrifices himself by plowing his truck into the infected mob and blowing them up, giving Alice and Claire time to load survivors into the helicopter. Alice decides to stay behind. She finds the pit full of her clones, and determined, enters the facility. Ordered by Wesker to liquidate Isaacs, Slater finds him locked in his lab, injecting himself with massive doses of anti-virus in an attempt to counteract the infection, which causes him to mutate from overdosing. Slater shoots Dr. Isaacs, triggering his mutation into a powerful Tyrant, and he devours Slater instantly. Issacs kills all the facility employees, but the facility's AI, the White Queen  manages to temporarily lock him in the facility's lower levels. Entering the facility, Alice meets the White Queen, who informs Alice that her blood is the cure to the T-virus and puts the facility at her disposal to develop a cure. She then tells Alice about Isaacs. Alice agrees to deal with him. On her way to the lab's lower levels, Alice discovers one of her clones, still in development. The clone awakens, but seems to die from premature exposure. During a battle between Isaacs and Alice, they find themselves in a replica of the Hive's laser corridor. The grid activates and slices Isaacs apart. Just as Alice is about to meet the same fate, the system is deactivated by her clone, who has inexplicably revived. Meanwhile, Claire has left with survivors in the helicopter for Alaska. Later, in Tokyo, Japan, Wesker informs the rest of the Umbrella board that the North American facility has been destroyed and now rendered unstable, and he will now control everything from Japan. Alice's hologram makes an appearance, declaring that she is coming for him and Umbrella. Standing beside her clone, Alice looks out onto the hundreds of pods containing her developing clones, as the scene blacks out.clone mutant post-apocalyptic dystopia conspiracy evil corporation zombie based on video game",False,tt0432021,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,148412065,1,0,2.2980458888888893,-6.117028646878049,58448934.2,82448934.2,29330570.25,75330570.25,21464682.0,62964682.0,47585110.666666664,7,77918444.0,3.0,84394835.0,3.0,129394835.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-41696962.0,0.0,25303038.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,82944923.0,162944923.0,1.0,-13155759.333333334,7177574.0,3.0,-4012679.0,55987321.0,1.0,2467327.0,3000000.0,1.0,,,,44620003.666666664,77620003.66666667,3.0,,,,40742302.0,66417302.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,85187853.33333333,134521186.66666666,3.0,-9937594.0,2062406.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,84394835.0,129394835.0,1.0,85584362.5,137084362.5,2.0,,,,53686844.333333336,83020177.66666667,3.0,77189848.5,116189848.5,77538772.33333333,30094327.888888888,1.25,1.6666666666666667,105980128.20199434

One day, Ray Singh , a boy Susie has a crush on, approaches her at her locker and slips a note into her textbook. He asks her out for the following Saturday. As Susie walks home through a cornfield, she runs into her neighbor, George Harvey , who coaxes her into an underground den that he says he has built for the neighborhood children. Inside, Susie becomes uncomfortable in Harvey's presence and attempts to leave; when he grabs her, she kicks him in the face and runs into the field and onto the street, rushing past classmate Ruth Connors . Meanwhile, the Salmon family becomes worried that Susie failed to return. Her father, Jack , leaves to search for her, while her mother, Abigail , waits for the police. In town, Susie sees her father, but he does not respond to her calls. Susie then runs home to find Harvey soaking in a bathtub. After seeing her charm bracelet hanging on the sink faucet near a bloody shaving razor, Susie realizes that she never escaped the den and was actually murdered by Harvey. Screaming, she is pulled into the ""In-Between"", that is neither Heaven nor Earth. From there, Susie watches over her loved ones, unable to let go despite her new afterlife friend, Holly , urging her to move on. Investigating Susie's disappearance with Detective Len Fenerman , Jack thinks Susie was murdered by someone she knew. He begins obsessively researching neighbors, including Harvey, who is actually the one who murdered Susie; Jack also comes to think that Harvey is the killer. But Fenerman, after he interviewed Harvey, he is unable to find any evidence that would link him as a suspect. Susie's sister, Lindsey , comes to agree with her father's suspicions, but their casework takes an emotional toll on Abigail, and Jack invites her alcoholic mother, Lynn , to move in with the family. Feeling alienated from her husband, Abigail leaves for California. In her afterlife, Susie inspects a lighthouse and learns that Harvey, who has now targeted Lindsey as his next victim, has murdered six other females, including Holly, and that he stuffed Susie's body into a safe in his basement. One night, Jack, carrying a bat, trails Harvey into the cornfield. However, Jack accidentally stumbles across Susie's friend, Clarissa . Her boyfriend, Brian , who mistakenly thinks that his girlfriend is being assaulted, nearly beats Jack to death while Harvey watches from a hiding spot. As Jack recuperates, Lindsey breaks into Harvey's house looking for evidence. Upstairs, she finds a notebook containing a sketch of the den, a lock of Susie's hair, and news articles about Susie's disappearance. Harvey returns home but Lindsey manages to escape and runs home to discover that her mother has returned. Not wishing to spoil the happy reunion of her parents, she hides the book from them and instead gives it to her grandmother. Fearful of being caught, Harvey flees, taking the safe with Susie's remains with him. The realm in Susie's afterlife begins expanding into a larger heaven, and she is greeted by Harvey's other victims. She resists Holly's urging to enter heaven along with the others, claiming she has one final thing to do. Meanwhile, Ruth and Ray are present when Harvey drives up to dispose of the safe at a sinkhole dump site on the Connors' property. Susie returns to Earth and enters Ruth's body, causing Ruth to faint. Ray rushes to Ruth's aid only to realize she has become Susie. They share a kiss, completing Susie's last wish, and she returns to Heaven, as Harvey drives away. Meanwhile, the safe is seen tumbling down the sinkhole before disappearing into the muddy water. Sometime later, Harvey meets a young woman outside a diner and offers her a ride, but she rebuffs him and leaves. A large icicle falls from an overhead branch, hitting Harvey on the shoulder. He loses his balance on the ice and falls backward over a cliff to his death. Time passes, and Susie sees that her family is healing, which Susie refers to as ""the lovely bones"" that grew around her absence. As the film concludes, Susie finally enters Heaven, telling the audience: ""My name is Salmon, like the fish; first name Susie. I was 14 years old when I was murdered on December 6, 1973. I was here for a moment and then I was gone. I wish you all a long and happy life.""rape loss of loved one based on novel or book 1970s evidence tree afterlife serial killer corpse pedophile teenage love grieving childhood sexual abuse based on young adult novel",True,tt0380510,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,93525586,1,0,0.4388551692307692,39.7198236153607,,,,,,,43823195.0,2,68823195.0,2.0,45841377.8,11.0,72841377.8,5.0,116070171.0,6.0,176070171.0,1.0,70027977.0,34.0,76127977.0,2.0,26947965.0,1.0,86947965.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19766659.166666668,61766659.166666664,12.0,11892615.0,23168615.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,96162137.16,60542137.16,6.75,2.2,151278235.71911615

In the present day, Connor MacLeod, the Highlander, is in New York City. In an arena parking garage, Connor is confronted by fellow immortal Iman Fasil, and decapitates him, upon which an energy surge destroys several cars around him. Connor is arrested by the police. The story goes back the 16th century Scottish Highlands. Connor and his clan, the Clan MacLeod, get ready to go into battle. Back to 1980's, the police let Connor go as they have failed to get any information from him. One of the detectives involved, BrendaCWyatt, is an expert in metallurgy and recognises Fasil's sword as an extremely rare Toledo Salamanca broadsword. Later Connor returns to the garage to retrieve his own sword, but sees Brenda is looking at the crime scene. She finds some metal shards embedded in a concrete column and saves them for analysis. The scene returns to the Highlands, where the Kurgan assists the clan Fraser against the Clan MacLeod in exchange for the sole rights to Connor. In the resulting confrontation the Kurgan stabs Connor, but is then driven off by the MacLeod clansmen. The wounded Connor is taken back to the village and everyone assumes he will die. When he makes a remarkable overnight recovery, the village is convinced that it is the work of the devil. The clan leader exiles Connor. In the present, Connor lives under the alias Russell Nash and is a wealthy antiquities dealer. Meanwhile, the Kurgan takes up residence at a seedy motel. Connor tails Brenda to a bar, but she leaves quickly. She then tails Connor, but the Kurgan attacks them both. The fight is interrupted by a police helicopter and everybody flees. Brenda has analyzed the metal fragments and discovered them to be from a Japanese katana, dated about 600 B.C. but made with advanced technology for the era. She makes a date with Connor in an attempt to entrap him. Connor recognises the ruse, tells her to stop digging and leaves. In the past, Connor lives an idyllic life with his wife Heather. One day the mysterious Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez appears and begins training Connor in sword fighting. He explains that they both belong to a group of immortals, who constantly fight one another, but can only be killed by complete decapitation. When one immortal decapitates another, the winner receives a transfer of power called ""the quickening."" Eventually all the immortals must do battle until there is only one left; the last survivor will receive ""the Prize."" Ramirez tells Connor that the Kurgan, the strongest of the immortals, must not win the Prize, or mankind will enter a dark age. One night, while Connor is away, the Kurgan attacks and decapitates Ramirez. In Central Park, Connor meets a long-time friend, fellow immortal Kastigir. They talk about the impending gathering of immortals which precedes the final battle, and joke about old times. Brenda has by now discovered that Connor has been alive for centuries, living under false identities, faking his death every few decades, signing his assets over to children who had died at birth and assuming their identities. She confronts Connor, who demonstrates his immortality. After this revelation Brenda and Connor become lovers, although Connor is reluctant, following a flashback in which Connor's wife, Heather, dies of old age in his arms. Ramirez has earlier explained that immortals cannot have children and should not get romantically involved. Ramirez reveals his Japanese katana was made specifically for him by the father of his third wife. The Kurgan kills Kastigir. When the Kurgan finds out about Connor's relationship with Brenda, he kidnaps her to draw Connor out. After a climactic battle at the Silvercup Studios in Queens, Connor defeats and beheads the Kurgan. He receives the Prize, which manifests itself as a massive quickening. Now mortal and capable of having children, Connor and Brenda move to Scotland. Connor now has awareness of people's thoughts around the world and uses this to encourage cooperation and peace.new york city scotland swordplay sword immortality cult film",False,tt0091203,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,5900000,0,0,-1.7118644067796611,2.3644495162840293,,,19187653.0,27187653.0,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,69347219.45454545,24.0,79174946.72727273,11.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,-5067854.0,9932146.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16148863.5,26148863.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,45020907.0,59520907.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,79174946.72727273,69347219.45454545,3.0,11.0,55214818.96773516

Nakano holds his residence in a cave of Mount Niri, and has gained a reputation as a master of Illusion. However, another Immortal named Kane is also interested in mastering the power of Illusion. He is making his way across Asia in order to reach Nakano again, with two henchmen in tow . Entering a nearby village seeking information, they proceed to burn it to the ground, and massacre its population. Eventually, they reach the cave. Kane soon manages to defeat and decapitate Nakano, despite Connor's attempts to prevent this. However, the energies released during the Quickening cause the cave to collapse. The Highlander manages to escape in time, but Kane and his men are left trapped inside the depths of the mountain. Their situation prevents them from participating in ""The Gathering"" of 1985. 18th century In 1788/1789, Connor was in France, where he makes the acquaintance of Sarah Barrington, an Englishwoman visiting relatives there, and who happens to resemble the future Alex Johnson. The two eventually become lovers. However, when the French Revolution begins, MacLeod becomes involved. MacLeod is captured, and sentenced to death by guillotine for treason against King Louis XVI of France. His Immortal friend Pierre Bouchet explains that he was tired of his immortal life, and dupes the guards into executing him in his place. Connor is falsely reported deceased. Believing her lover dead, Sarah is left grieving. After his escape, MacLeod returns to discover that she has moved on with her life by marrying another man, and having children. Modern day In 1994, Connor is living with his adopted son John in Marakesh. It is revealed that in 1987, Brenda Wyatt, the woman he married after the Gathering, was killed in a car accident. Although he survived the accident himself, he still believes that ""The Game"" is over. Meanwhile, in Japan, two archaeologists have started excavating a cave in order to discover whether the legend of the sorcerer Nakano was based on fact. One of these archaeologists is Dr. Alexandra Johnson, whose interests in the legend eventually lead her to Connor MacLeod. Connor is intrigued by Alex due to her resemblance to Sarah. The excavations free Kane, who immediately sets out in pursuit of Connor. MacLeod leaves John in the care of his friend Jack Donovan, and then departs to New York City to engage in the final showdown for the Prize. However, as Khabul's decapitated body is found in a hospital washroom, Lt. John Stenn goes on the trail of the main suspect of the 1985 ""headhunter"" case, Russell Nash. Russell Nash was the alias used by MacLeod during the time of the Gathering. As Alex investigates a piece of cloth found on the site, she discovers that it is a shred of a kilt, with a design that designates a branch of the MacLeod family. This leads her to Nash Antiques, where Connor has returned in preparation for the battle against Kane. The Highlander is confronted on Holy Ground at a former Buddhist shrine by Kane, who proceeds to challenge him. The resulting fight is a violation of the Immortal Golden Rule; the battle ends when MacLeod's katana blade is shattered. Kane flees, and Connor decides to return to Scotland to build another sword though his initial attempts are unsuccessful. Alex tracks him down to give him a bar of finely refined steel that she found in Nakano's cave with which he is able to forge a new sword, and the two then become lovers. However, the trip is cut short, as MacLeod learns from Jack Donovan that his son John is on a plane bound for New York. MacLeod returns as quickly as possible, but he's too late. Kane abducts John, and holds him hostage to lure MacLeod to him. MacLeod meets Kane in an old church mission, and then follows him into an abandoned power plant for their final battle.

The Colonial Marine spaceship Sulaco experiences an onboard fire and launches an escape pod containing Ellen Ripley  along with Newt, Hicks, and the damaged android Bishop. All four are in cryonic stasis. During the launch, the ship's medical scans of the crew's cryotubes show an Alien facehugger attached to one of the crewmembers. The pod then crashes on Fiorina 'Fury' 161, a foundry facility and penal colony inhabited by all-male inmates with ""double-Y"" chromosome patterns and histories of physical and sexual violence. After some inmates recover the pod and its passengers, an Alien facehugger is seen approaching the prison dog. Ripley is taken in and awakened by Clemens , the prison doctor, and is told she is the only survivor of the crash. Many of the ex-inmates, led by Dillon , have embraced an apocalyptic, millenarian version of Christianity. Ripley is warned by the prison warden, Harold Andrews,  that her presence among them may have extremely disruptive effects. Suspicious of what caused the escape pod to jettison and what killed her companions, Ripley requests that Clemens perform an autopsy on Newt. She fears that Newt may be carrying an Alien embryo in her body, though she does not share this information. Despite protests from the warden and his assistant, Aaron , the autopsy is conducted. No embryo is found in Newt's body, and Clemens proclaims she simply died in the crash. Meanwhile, Ripley's unusual behavior begins to frustrate the warden and is agitating the prisoners, to the point that three of them attempt to rape her before being violently thwarted by Dillon. A funeral is performed for Newt and Hicks, during which their bodies are cremated in the facility's enormous furnace. In another section of the facility, the prison dog  enters convulsions, and a seemingly full-grown Alien bursts from its body. The Alien soon begins to attack members of the colony, killing several and returning an outcast prisoner Golic  to his former deranged state. To get answers, Ripley recovers and reactivates the damaged android Bishop, who confirms that there was an Alien on the Sulaco and it came with them to Fiorina in the escape pod. She then informs Andrews of her previous encounters with the Aliens and suggests everyone work together to hunt it down and kill it. Andrews does not believe her story and explains that the facility has no weapons. Their only hope of protection is the rescue ship being sent for Ripley by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. Back in the prison infirmary, while talking to Ripley about the situation, Clemens is killed by the Alien, but when it is about to attack Ripley, it suddenly pauses, then retreats, mysteriously sparing her life. She runs to the mess hall to warn the others, only to see the Alien kill the warden. Ripley rallies the inmates and proposes they pour highly flammable toxic waste, which is stored at the facility, into the ventilation system and ignite it to flush out the creature. An explosion is caused by the creature's premature intervention, resulting in several deaths. Using the medical equipment aboard the Sulaco escape pod, Ripley scans herself and discovers the embryo of an Alien Queen growing inside her. She also finds out that the Corporation truly wants the Queen embryo and the adult Alien, hoping to turn them into biological weapons. Deducing that the mature alien will not kill her because of the embryo she carries, Ripley begs Dillon to kill her; he agrees to do so only if she helps the inmates kill the adult creature first. They form a plan to lure it into the foundry's molding facility and drown it in molten lead by trapping it by closing a series of doors. The bait-and-chase style plan results in the death of Dillon and all the remaining prisoners, except Morse ([[Danny Webb , who pours the lead. The Alien, covered in molten metal, escapes the mold and is killed by Ripley when she turns on fire sprinklers and sprays the beast with water, causing its exoskeleton to cool rapidly and shatter via thermal shock. While Ripley battles the Alien, the Weyland-Yutani team arrives, including a man named Michael Bishop who looks identical to the Bishop android, claiming to be its creator. He tries to persuade Ripley to undergo surgery to remove the Queen embryo, which he claims will be destroyed. Ripley refuses and steps back onto a mobile platform, which Morse positions over the furnace. The company men shoot Morse in the leg, and Aaron picks up a large wrench and strikes Bishop over the head with it. Aaron is shot dead, and Bishop and his men show their true intentions, begging Ripley to let them have the ""magnificent specimen"". Ripley defies them by throwing herself into the gigantic furnace, just as the alien Queen begins to erupt from her chest. As she dies from the wound, Ripley grabs the creature, holding on to it as she falls into the fire. The facility is closed down and the last surviving inmate, Morse, is led away.

As the investigation proceeds, the agents begin to become aware of the possible existence of ""Suspect Zero"", a mythical ""super serial killer"" responsible for hundreds of deaths across all 50 states who leaves no evidence behind to link his crimes together. The agents must decide if O'Ryan is the key that will allow them to catch Suspect Zero, or if he is Suspect Zero himself. As it turns out, O'Ryan was part of a secret government experiment attempting to cultivate telepathic abilities in individuals for military purposes. The experiments gave O'Ryan the ability to see the actions of serial killers. These disturbing visions constantly torment O'Ryan, and drive him to find the killers and kill them. O'Ryan seeks out Mackelway because Mackelway shares his abilities to some degree and was involved in a controversial case that made headlines. O'Ryan hunts down Suspect Zero, whose child victims are giving O'Ryan even more nightmares. The actual ""Suspect Zero"" is another man who travels over the United States with a refrigerated truck. He targets children, whom he kidnaps and transports to his ranch to be killed. He is not THE Suspect Zero, however, as Mackelway had identified evidence linking his crimes together: Because of the time spent locked in the truck, all of his victims had signs of freezer burns. Eventually, Mackelway and O'Ryan find Suspect Zero at his ranch. After a struggle outside, Suspect Zero is killed when Mackelway crushes his skull with a rock. O'Ryan then tries to convince Mackelway to end his suffering by killing him. When Mackelway refuses, O'Ryan pretends to attack him, prompting Kulok  to shoot him to defend her partner. A major motif of the film is remote viewing, and the DVD's extra features include interviews with people who worked with the US military and intelligence agencies as part of those programs.serial killer",False,tt0324127,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,13000000,0,0,-1.0769230769230769,1.9257596443831189,-1916073.9166666667,43000592.75,,,73708457.0,95708457.0,127500343.0,4,152500343.0,1.0,-14886267.0,2.0,10113733.0,1.0,30798122.0,22.0,43948122.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,279017.0,8279017.0,1.0,,,,-9773208.0,226792.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,-2357142.0,5142858.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,68854066.0,47804066.0,3.5,1.3333333333333333,84824632.31357588

Pompey flees to Egypt, hoping to enlist the support of the young Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII  and his sister Cleopatra . Caesar pursues and meets the teenage Ptolemy and the boy's advisers, who seem to do most of the thinking for him. As a gesture of 'goodwill', the Egyptians present Caesar with Pompey's head, but Caesar is not pleased; it is a sorry end for a worthy foe. As Caesar settles in at the palace, Apollodorus , disguised as a rug peddler, brings a gift from Cleopatra. When a suspicious Caesar unrolls the rug, he finds Cleopatra herself concealed within and is intrigued. Days later, she warns Caesar that her brother has surrounded the palace with his soldiers and that he is vastly outnumbered. Caesar is unconcerned. He orders the Egyptian fleet burned so he can gain control of the harbor. The fire spreads to the city, burning many buildings, including the famous Library of Alexandria. Cleopatra angrily confronts Caesar, but he refuses to pull troops away from the fight with Ptolemy's forces to deal with the fire. In the middle of their spat, Caesar begins kissing her. The Romans hold, and the armies of Mithridates arrive on Egyptian soil. The following day, Caesar passes judgment. He sentences Ptolemy's lord chamberlain to death for arranging an assassination attempt on Cleopatra, and rules that Ptolemy and his tutor be sent to join Ptolemy's now greatly outnumbered troops, a sentence of death as the Egyptian army faces off against Mithridates. Cleopatra is crowned Queen of Egypt. She dreams of ruling the world with Caesar. When their son Caesarion is born, Caesar accepts him publicly, which becomes the talk of Rome and the Senate.  Caesar returns to Rome for his triumph, while Cleopatra remains in Egypt. Two years pass before the two see each other again. After he is made dictator for life, Caesar sends for Cleopatra. She arrives in Rome in a lavish procession and wins the adulation of the Roman people. The Senate grows increasingly discontented amid rumors that Caesar wishes to be made king, which is anathema to the Romans. On the Ides of March in 44 B.C., the Senate is preparing to vote on whether to award Caesar additional powers. Despite warnings from his wife Calpurnia  and Cleopatra, he is confident of victory. However, he is stabbed to death by various senators. Octavian , Caesar's nephew, is named as his heir, not Caesarion. Realizing she has no future in Rome, Cleopatra returns home to Egypt. Two years later, Caesar's assassins, among them Cassius  and Brutus , are killed at the Battle of Philippi. The following year, Mark Antony  establishes a second triumvirate with Octavian and Lepidus. They split up the empire: Lepidus receives Africa, Octavian Spain and Gaul, while Antony will take control of the eastern provinces. However, the rivalry between Octavian and Antony is becoming apparent. While planning a campaign against Parthia in the east, Antony realizes he needs money and supplies, and cannot get enough from anywhere but Egypt. After refusing several times to leave Egypt, Cleopatra gives in and meets him in Tarsus. Antony becomes drunk during a lavish feast. Cleopatra sneaks away, leaving a slave dressed as her, but Antony discovers the trick and confronts the queen. They soon become lovers. Octavian uses their affair in his smear campaign against Antony. When Antony returns to Rome to address the situation brewing there, Octavian traps him into a marriage of state to Octavian's sister, Octavia . Cleopatra flies into a rage when she learns the news. A year or so later, when Antony next sees Cleopatra, he is forced to humble himself publicly. She demands a third of the empire in return for her aid. Antony acquiesces and divorces Octavia. Octavian clamors for war against Antony and his ""Egyptian whore"". The Senate is unmoved by his demands until Octavian reveals that Antony has left a will stating that he is to be buried in Egypt; shocked and insulted, the Senators who had previously stood by Antony abandon their hero and vote for war. Octavian murders the Egyptian ambassador, Cleopatra's tutor Sosigenes , on the Senate steps.  The war is decided at the naval Battle of Actium on September 2, 31 B.C. where Octavian's fleet, under the command of Agrippa, defeats the Anthony-Egyptian fleet. Seeing Antony's ship burning, Cleopatra assumes he is dead and orders the Egyptian forces home. Antony follows, leaving his fleet leaderless and soon defeated. Several months later, Cleopatra manages to convince Antony to retake command of his troops and fight Octavian's advancing army. However, Antony's soldiers have lost faith in him and abandon him during the night; Rufio , the last man loyal to Antony, is killed. Antony tries to goad Octavian into single combat, but is finally forced to flee into the city. When Antony returns to the palace, Apollodorus, not believing that Antony is worthy of his queen, convinces him that she is dead, whereupon Antony falls on his own sword. Apollodorus then takes Antony to Cleopatra, and he dies in her arms. Octavian captures the city without a battle and Cleopatra is brought before him. He wants to return to Rome in triumph, with her as his prisoner. However, realizing that her son is also dead, she arranges to be bitten by a poisonous asp. She sends her servant Charmian to give Octavian a letter. In the letter she asks to be buried with Antony. Octavian realizes that she is going to kill herself and he and his guards burst into Cleopatra's chamber and find her dressed in gold and her and her servant Iras dead while an asp crawls along the floor. Octavian is angry that she is dead and leaves. One of Octavian's guards asks dying Charmian if the queen killed herself well and Charmian answers, ""Extremely well"" and dies.egypt greece snake nile ancient rome historical figure cleopatra epic library of alexandria julius caesar 1st century marcus aurelius alexandria marcus antonius ptolemaica cícero gaius triumvirate second triumvirate augustus caesar battle of actium batalha de áccio otaviano imperador augusto república romana império romano nilo",False,tt0056937,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,71000000,0,0,1.2818576249397398,14.350482420740235,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,78820932.06047031

Deirdre briefs the men on their mission, attacking a heavily armed convoy and stealing a briefcase, the contents of which are never identified. Following the briefing, the team begins assembling their equipment, and Deirdre meets with her handler, Seamus O'Rourke , who reveals that Russian gangsters are bidding for the case so the team must act quickly to intercept it. Later, Spence is exposed as a fraud and summarily dismissed. The others depart for Nice, France where they observe the convoy for several days and form a plan. They ambush the convoy and pursue the survivors through the surrounding countryside. After a lengthy car chase and gun battle, Gregor betrays the team, steals the case, and disappears. Gregor first tries to sell the case to the Russians, but his contact betrays him, and Gregor shoots him. He next contacts Mikhi , the leader of the gangsters, and threatens to sell the case to the IRA unless Mikhi pays a grossly inflated price; Mikhi agrees. Meanwhile, the rest of the team track Gregor through one of Sam's old CIA contacts and corner him in the Arles Amphitheatre. Following a hectic firefight, Gregor flees, but is captured by Seamus, who kills Larry and escapes with Deirdre. Sam is wounded in the fight, and is taken to a villa owned by Vincent's friend Jean-Pierre . After removing the bullet and allowing Sam time to recuperate, Vincent asks Jean-Pierre to help him locate Gregor, Deirdre, and Seamus. Meanwhile, Gregor admits to Seamus he mailed the case to himself. Days later, as Gregor and Seamus retrieve the case, Sam confronts Deirdre, who realizes that Sam has feelings for her and will not shoot her. Following a high-speed chase through Paris, Vincent shoots out Dierdre's tires and sends her car over a highway overpass. Gregor emerges from the car with the briefcase and escapes, while Deirdre and Seamus are rescued from the burning car. Vincent and Sam discover that the case is a type used by figure skaters. Intelligence from Jean-Pierre's contacts also suggest the Russians are involved with figure skater Natacha Kirilova , who is appearing at the local arena. At the arena, Mikhi, in the audience watching Natacha, receives a call and goes backstage. At the meet, Gregor reveals there is a sniper in the arena who will shoot Natacha if Mikhi betrays him. Mikhi shoots Gregor anyway, the sniper shoots Natacha, and Mikhi leaves with the case and the money. Vincent and Sam follow the panicked crowd out of the arena in time to see Seamus shoot Mikhi and steal the case. Sam runs ahead of Seamus and finds Deirdre sitting in the getaway car. He urges her to leave, revealing himself as a CIA agent pursuing Seamus, not the briefcase. Seamus shoots his way past the crowd, wounding Vincent, back to the arena, with Sam in pursuit. In the final gunfight, Seamus is about to kill Sam, but is fatally shot by Vincent.

Jill is participating in a clay pigeon shooting contest. They befriend a foreigner, Louis Bernard , who is staying in their hotel. One evening, as Jill dances with Louis, she witnesses his assassination as a French spy. Before dying, the spy passes on to them some vital information to be delivered to the British consul. In order to ensure their silence, the assassins, led by a charming and nefarious Abbott , kidnap the Lawrences' daughter. Unable therefore to seek help from the police, the couple return to England and, after following a series of leads, discover that the group intends to assassinate the ambassador of an unidentified European country, during a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Jill attends the concert and distracts the gunman with a scream. The assassins are tracked to a working-class area of London near the docks, where they have their hide-out in the church of a sun-worshipping cult. Bob enters and is held prisoner, but manages to escape. The police surround the building and a gunfight ensues. The assassins hold out until their ammunition runs low and most of them have been killed. Betty, who has been held there, and one of the criminals are seen on the roof, and it is Jill's sharpshooting skills that dispatch the man, who, it emerges, was the man who beat Jill in a shooting contest in Switzerland. As Abbott seems to commit suicide rather than be captured, Betty is returned to her parents.kidnapping concert murder shootout scream criminal clue dentist hypnotism ski resort brawl assassination plot corrupt church cymbals sharpshooting worship service",False,tt0025452,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,10250000,0,0,3.1,2.936674755788624,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,75553115.24729376

Three families represent three social classes: the Wilcoxes are wealthy capitalists, the class that is displacing the aristocracy; the Schlegel sisters represent the enlightened bourgeoisie; and the Basts are in the lower middle class.  The film asks the question 'Who will inherit England?' and answers it through the ownership of the house, Howards End, as it passes from person to person. At the start of the film, the younger sister, Helen Schlegel , rashly becomes engaged to the younger Wilcox son, Paul. The next day both realise their mistake and break it off, but Helen has told her older sister, who tells her family. Her Aunt Juley  arrives at Howards End and so makes the Wilcox family aware of the engagement. Later, when the Wilcox family takes a house near to the Schlegels in London, the sister, Margaret Schlegel , feels compelled to visit because of the social embarrassment of the previous year. She befriends the mother, Ruth Wilcox . Ruth is descended from English yeoman stock and it is through her family that the Wilcoxes own Howards End, a house which she loves dearly and which is the symbol of rural England and English tradition. Over the course of a few months, the two women become close friends, and Ruth sees in Margaret a kindred spirit. Hearing that the lease on the Schlegels' London house is due to expire, and knowing she is soon to die, Ruth bequeaths Howards End to Margaret. This causes great consternation for the Wilcoxes, who refuse to believe that Ruth was in her ""right mind"" or intended her home to go to a relative stranger. The Wilcoxes burn the piece of paper that Ruth's bequest is written on, and decide to keep her will secret. Because he knows that he has prevented the Schlegels from finding a home in Howards End, Henry Wilcox  offers to help Margaret find a new place to live. As a result, the two become close and Henry proposes. Margaret accepts. The Schlegels befriend a young, poor, yet intellectual clerk, Leonard Bast . Wishing to improve his lot, they pass along advice from Henry that Leonard should leave his post because his company is heading for a crash. Leonard does so, but finds himself in a worse position and eventually unemployed. The two plotlines converge at the marriage party of Evie Wilcox . Helen has found the Basts starving and brings them to the party. Jacky Bast  becomes drunk; Margaret approaches her with Henry to find out who she is. Jacky recognises Henry and it becomes clear that years previously he had had an affair with her. Humiliated and suspicious, Henry breaks off the engagement, but that evening he and Margaret reconcile and she forgives his sexual impropriety. In accordance with Henry's wishes, she insists that Helen take the Basts away and refuses them help. Because of this, the Schlegel sisters drift apart. Helen has a brief affair with Leonard Bast. She becomes pregnant, and leaves the country, telling none of her condition. When Helen returns to take her possessions, she asks if she can stay one night at Howards End. When Henry Wilcox finds out that Helen is pregnant, he insists that she cannot stay in the house, and that the man responsible must be found out and punished for dishonouring her. Margaret and Henry argue bitterly about the different standards of sexual propriety applied to men and women, and Margaret says she is leaving Henry. Margaret, Leonard and the oldest Wilcox son Charles  all make their way separately to Howards End and the final tragedy unfolds: Charles attacks and inadvertently kills Leonard, and is arrested. Henry's pride is shaken; his feelings break through at last, and he and Margaret become truly close. Ultimately, Ruth Wilcox's wish is fulfilled: Henry leaves Howards End to Margaret upon his death. Helen is reconciled with Margaret, and Helen will raise her son as heir. In both film and novel, the final ownership of Howards End is a symbol of new class relations in England: the wealth of the new industrialists  married to the politically reforming vision of liberalism  that will benefit the children of the lower classes .london, england sibling relationship based on novel or book empowerment sister class differences english countryside turn of the century edwardian england early 1900s wealthy family sister sister relationship",False,tt0104454,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,26126837,1,0,2.265854625,2.6736984935700776,,,,,,,1176701.0,3,10176701.0,1.0,17966644.0,7.0,20966644.0,1.0,11124775.333333334,15.0,28458108.666666668,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-7410692.0,9.0,589308.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,17966644.0,20966644.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,17966644.0,20966644.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,17966644.0,20966644.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17966644.0,20966644.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,15047690.416666668,5714357.083333334,4.25,1.5,96568078.59273516

He and his senior colleague Ken  are sent to Bruges by their employer Harry Waters , and told to await further instructions. While Ken takes in the sights and historic medieval buildings, Ray is agitated and depressed, wracked with guilt over the boy's death. One night, while observing a film shoot with a dwarf actor Jimmy , Ray strikes up a romance with Chloë , a local drug dealer and thief, moonlighting as a production assistant. On a date, Ray gets involved in a fistfight with a couple from Canada, mistaking them for Americans. Later that night, Chloë's former boyfriend Eirik  threatens Ray with a handgun loaded with blanks, but Ray disarms him and shoots Eirik in the eye, partially blinding him. Despite his budding romance with Chloë, Ray's guilt at his accidental killing of the boy continues to haunt him. Ken finally receives a call from Harry, who orders him to kill Ray on the principle that the killing of a child — even accidentally — is unforgivable; he would expect the same penalty if it happened to him, as Harry is a family man himself. Ken retrieves a handgun from Harry's local Belgian contact and tracks Ray to a park. As Ken sneaks up behind Ray to kill him, he sees Ray is about to shoot himself. His concern for his young friend overrides his sense of duty to their employer, and Ken prevents Ray's suicide. Ken then confesses to Ray that he had been ordered by Harry to kill Ray, although Ken denies that he intended to go through with the execution. While the two discuss the situation, Ken takes Ray's gun and convinces him to leave the city and the business. Following Ray's departure, Ken calls Harry, reveals his insubordination and location, and abruptly hangs up. An enraged Harry immediately heads to Bruges, where he gets a gun and dumdum bullets from his contact. Before Ray's train has travelled far from the city, he is arrested for assaulting the Canadian couple and escorted back to Bruges. Chloë bails Ray out of jail, and the two share a drink on the market square beneath Bruges' belfry. Ken and Harry meet for a drink nearby, before heading to the belfry, passing by Ray and Chloë without noticing them. At the top of the carillon tower, Ken declares that Ray deserves a chance at redemption, but refuses to fight Harry in defense of his own life, as he loves and respects him for his honor and generosity. Harry, while furious, takes pity on Ken and shoots him in the leg rather than in the head. When Eirik, passing by, spots Ray and Chloë and informs Harry of Ray's location, Ken fights with Harry for Ray's sake, and is shot in the neck. Harry descends the steps to confront Ray, leaving Ken seriously wounded. Ken drags himself back to the top of the carillon tower and searches for Harry in an attempt to shoot him before he harms Ray, but due to fog, he cannot see from the tower. Ken decides to jump off with his gun, hoping to allow Ray to use it in his defence. After first scattering coins to clear the area below of people, he jumps and lands in the plaza, living just long enough to warn Ray of Harry's arrival. However, the gun is shattered by the fall. With Harry in pursuit, Ray flees back to the hotel for his gun, which Ken had stashed in a drawer in their room. Harry arrives soon after, but Marie , the pregnant owner of the hotel, refuses to allow him up the stairs. Shouting through the stairwell, both men agree that Ray will try to flee from the back of the hotel, and Harry will run after him and shoot him if he can. Ray jumps on to a passing boat and drops his gun in the process. Ray looks back in time to see Harry drawing down on him from a bridge, but doubts that Harry will be able to make the shot due to the distance. Despite the long range, Harry fires and hits Ray in the abdomen. Harry pursues the now-wounded Ray through the streets before stumbling onto the film set, where Jimmy is in costume as a schoolboy. Harry shoots Ray another three times and in the process inadvertently shoots Jimmy in the head with the expanding ammunition, effectively decapitating him. Mistaking Jimmy's headless body for that of a child, Harry commits suicide on principle despite Ray's attempts to stop him. The gravely-wounded Ray is lifted onto an ambulance as he sees Marie, Eirik and Chloë in turn. Once in the ambulance, Ray considers prison or death as sufficient recompense for accidentally killing the boy, but then wonders if hell consists of staying in Bruges forever, at which point he says he hopes to live. He then slips into unconsciousness, leaving his fate unclear.drug dealer hitman tourist church guilt death cult film bruges belgium town square vietnamese canadian stereotype neo-noir christmas",False,tt0780536,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,34533783,1,0,1.3022521999999999,-1.6278585820155915,,,-5715000.0,285000.0,14932023.0,40682023.0,6077245.0,5,86077245.0,2.0,161626055.75,12.0,235876055.75,8.0,212127634.2222222,12.0,261849856.44444445,9.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-2438290.0,12.0,6811710.0,2.0,,0.0,,,17316267.0,105316267.0,1.0,19317281.5,29317281.5,4.0,,,,83567857.0,203567857.0,1.0,26332385.0,30332385.0,1.0,26332385.0,30332385.0,1.0,,,,,,,102245280.6,130095280.6,10.0,16547664.333333334,21340997.666666668,3.0,7548336.0,18798336.0,2.0,,,,52734926.4,59034926.4,5.0,481333024.0,577333024.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,123382157.0,138882157.0,2.0,,,,222500000.0,262500000.0,1.0,,,,10380902.5,23630902.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,147653716.7986111,94348161.24305555,5.125,5.25,95612307.5388973

The two soldiers confront each other in a trench, where they wait for dark. They trade insults and even find some common ground. Confounding the situation is another wounded Bosniak soldier  who wakes from unconsciousness. A land mine had been buried beneath him by the Bosnian Serbs; should he make any move, it would be fatal. A French sergeant , of the United Nations Protection Force , gets involved in effort to help the three trapped soldiers, despite initial orders to the contrary by high command. UNPROFOR's mission in Bosnia was to guard the humanitarian aid convoys, to remain neutral and act as a mere bystander. Luckily, an English reporter arrives on scene, bringing media pressure to bear that moves the United Nations high command to swing into action to try to save the soldiers. A row between the stressed out and fatigued Čiki and Nino gradually escalates even after being rescued. Eventually, Čiki shoots Nino and is in turn shot by a Peacekeeper. After this confrontation, it is found that the mine cannot be defused. The UNPROFOR high command tries to save face: they lie, saying that Cera has been saved and they leave the area, along with the reporters and everyone else. In reality, Cera is left alone and desolate in the trenches, still immobilized by the mine. Meanwhile, the UNPROFOR commander has arranged false information to be passed to both Bosnian and Serb troops, to make them believe their enemies will be trying to reoccupy the trench at night .bosnia and herzegovina recruit bosnian war united nations land mine unexploded bomb peacekeeper",True,tt0283509,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2684207,0,0,1.684207,-0.8553948535632829,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,121757219.71668534

Enchanted, he follows it on horseback, waving his arm. Ten years later, Lieutenant von Richthofen  is serving as a fighter pilot with the Imperial German Air Service along the Western Front. After dropping a wreath over the funeral of an Allied pilot, whom they knew, Richthofen and his fellow pilots Werner Voss  and Friedrich Sternberg encounter a squadron of enemy planes led by Captain Lanoe Hawker. Richthofen shoots down Canadian pilot Arthur Roy Brown . After pulling Brown out of the wreckage of his plane, Richthofen assists Nurse Käte Otersdorf  with applying a tourniquet to the Canadian's wounded leg. Later, after successfully shooting down and killing ""the notorious Captain Hawker,"" Richthofen is awarded the Pour le Mérite and promoted to command his own private aerial Squadron. There, he is soon joined by his brother Lothar von Richthofen. He orders his men to avoid killing enemy pilots unless absolutely necessary and is enraged when Lothar deliberately strafes and kills a British pilot who has already been forced into a landing. Later, during an aerial dogfight, Richthofen again encounters Captain Brown, who has escaped from a German POW camp after being nursed by Käte. Brown lands his damaged aircraft in No-Man's land and von Richthofen lands to make sure Brown is well and in the process von Richthofen damages his aircraft. They share a friendly drink and Brown expresses the hope that they will not meet again until after the war is over. He tells Richthofen that Käte has feelings for him. When Richthofen asks how he can be so sure, Brown retorts, ""She kept bitching about you for weeks."" On the way back to base, Richthofen is devastated to learn that his close friend, the Jewish pilot Friedrich Sternberg, has been shot down and killed. Over the days that follow, Richthofen makes no secret of his grief and refuses to leave his room. An enraged Lothar reminds him that ""A leader cannot afford to mourn."" Shortly thereafter, Richthofen is wounded in the skull during a dogfight and is sent to be nursed by Käte. As he recovers, the two share a romantic dinner and a dance in Lille. After Richthofen expresses gratitude for his wound, an enraged Käte gives him a tour of a local field hospital and berates him for regarding war as a game. Later, Richthofen and Käte are beginning to make love when they are interrupted by an Allied bombing raid. Determined to protect the squadron's aeroplanes, he orders Käte to hide in the cellar and takes to the air with his men. During the raid, Richthofen's wound begins to reopen, making him disoriented, and upon witnessing the death of his protege Kurt Wolff, he goes into a state of rage in the air. During a later visit from Käte, Richthofen informs her that he has been offered a rear echelon position in command of the entire Air Service. Käte, who has long been frantic at the thought of losing him, is overjoyed. Richthofen, however, conceals his doubts from her. He goes to speak with Werner Voss  about what decision to make. The two joke that Voss is encouraging him to take the promotion so that he can pass up Richthofen's score. He then jokingly tells Voss that he will step down if Voss stops flying first. Voss replies by saying: ""I don't think so. I'm married to my plane; this is how I spend my spare time."" Shortly after, Richthofen tours the Fokker manufacturing plant in Germany, when Anthony Fokker complains that Richthofen's pilots are installing enemy engines into the planes that he has made. When Richthofen asks how he knows about this, Fokker tells him about the British recovery of a ""new triplane"", and says that they were ""...less than amused to find one of their own Bentley engines in a Fokker they shot down."" indicating that Voss has been killed, and that Richthofen has lost yet another close friend. Richthofen has realized that he is being manipulated for propaganda by Kaiser Wilhelm II and his Generals Ernst Wilhelm von Hoeppner, Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff. On the eve of the Spring Offensive in February 1918, he approaches Generalfeldmarschall von Hindenburg and tells him that the war has become a no-win situation which should be ended as soon as possible. Hindenburg is outraged and orders him back to his squadron. As the offensive begins, Richthofen's squadron sets out to clear every Allied aeroplane and balloon out of the target area. As Käte tends the wounded on the ground, she is horrified to learn that her beloved has returned to combat. Käte confronts him and demands to know why he has turned down the chance to remain safe. Richthofen states that he will not betray the soldiers in the field ""by remaining the immortal god that Berlin wants me to be"", and tells her that ""You are my greatest victory."" On the morning of 21 April 1918, Richthofen leads his squadron into battle after making love to Käte. Soon after, he is killed in action. In the aftermath, Käte crosses over to Allied lines with Brown's assistance. She directly addresses Richthofen's grave, ""I could not come sooner. It is not so easy to cross the lines into British territory. Finally a friend of ours helped me. He asked me why it was important for me to come here. I told him I love you. Did I ever tell you?"" The camera pans to a funeral wreath left by the Royal Flying Corps, ""To our friend and enemy, Manfred von Richthofen.""flying nurse world war i airplane",False,tt0365675,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,2783332,1,0,-5.467068966260584,-1.6278585820155915,,,,,,,,0,,,61505388.0,5.0,156505388.0,1.0,-3787957.3333333335,9.0,38545376.0,3.0,94019883.0,10.0,135019883.0,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-7788574.0,22211426.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,110023549.0,50579104.55555555,3.0,2.3333333333333335,95612307.5388973

After her first sex-ed class, his 10-year-old daughter Maya  insists on hearing the story of how her parents met. Will gives in, but decides to change the names and some of the facts relating to the various love affairs of his youth, thereby creating a love mystery; Maya is left guessing which of the women will turn out to be her mother. The story he tells Maya is depicted in long flashbacks. From time to time the film switches back to the present, where Maya comments  and asks questions. The story begins in 1992 when Will, a starry-eyed aspiring political operative, moves away from Wisconsin and his college sweetheart, Emily  to New York City, where he works on the Clinton campaign. Over the years, Will becomes involved with three women who enter and re-enter his life, including Summer Hartley  an aspiring journalist, and April  the copy girl for the campaign. Will and April have a chance meeting outside work, where Will reveals he is going to propose to Emily. When Will practices his proposal to Emily on April, she is taken aback by Will's heartfelt words, and replies, ""Definitely, maybe."" They go back to her apartment, where April has multiple copies of Jane Eyre in her collection, explaining that her father gave her a copy with an inscription in the front shortly before he died, and the book was later lost. She has spent years looking through copies of Jane Eyre at secondhand stores hoping to find the copy her father gave her, but she buys any copy she finds that has inscription. They suddenly kiss, but Will backs away and leaves. Emily comes back to New York where she confesses, just after Will proposes, that she slept with his roommate. She did it on purpose to break up with Will, saying that she is ""letting him go"" because she doesn't share his rather lofty aspirations. After Clinton is elected, Will opens a campaigning business with most of his work colleagues, which enjoys a good amount of success. Before Will left Wisconsin, Emily asked Will to deliver a package to her former roommate, Summer Hartley, who is living in New York City. Will first meets Summer when he gives her the package, a diary that she wrote when she was a teenager . He finds she is going out with a famous writer who is old enough to be her father. However, the writer breaks up with Summer and Will starts a relationship with her. Meanwhile, April quits her job and goes to travel around the world. Will plans to propose to Summer when April comes back to tell him she loves him. However, she sees Will's intentions and reluctantly congratulates him instead. Summer writes a derogatory article about one of Will's clients, which causes the end of her relationship with Will. As a result of the article, Will loses his business and his dream of a political career goes down the drain. April calls after a long while and finds that Will is unemployed and unhappy. She throws a birthday party for him where he is reunited with his old colleagues. In a drunken rant, Will confesses his romantic feelings for April, but in the process ends up having a fight with her, questioning why she works in a used book store and telling her to ""go to life rehab."" Some time later, while walking the streets Will passes a used book store and sees the copy of Jane Eyre with the inscription from April's father. Will goes to April's apartment to give her the book, but he decides against it when he meets her live-in boyfriend Kevin. Emily re-enters Will's life when she moves to New York City, and turns out to be Maya's mother and Will's ex-wife, as Maya correctly guesses. Will explains to Maya that his story had a happy ending, which was Maya. Will and Maya share a hug and part ways as Maya leaves with her mother. At home, Will finds the book he has been saving for April, and goes to the offices of Amnesty International, where April is now working. After learning that April is now single again, Will gives her the book. But, when April finds out that Will had been holding on to the book for years, she becomes upset and asks him to leave. Maya is happy that she figured out the story, but also realizes that her father still loves April, as even though Will changed the names of Emily , and Summer , he did not change April's name. Encouraged by Maya, they go to April's apartment, where Will confesses to April that he held on to the copy of Jane Eyre because it was the only thing he had left of her. As the three enter into April's building, April springs into Will's arms and kisses him.lovesickness parent child relationship love of one's life narration lovers kiss daughter affection relation make a match sex education relationship divorce past relationship",False,tt0832266,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,55617866,1,0,6.94540942857143,-1.6278585820155915,,,74910232.90697674,112852093.37209302,40879839.6,70389839.6,40103895.0,2,57103895.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-9401355.0,6.0,598645.0,1.0,,0.0,,,45147255.75,10.0,77147255.75,4.0,18363501.25,26.0,34238501.25,4.0,-8217802.0,2.0,5782198.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,8453567.333333334,77453567.33333333,3.0,,,,45868327.0,71868327.0,1.0,,,,70306374.0,85306374.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,86704456.90476191,115935885.47619048,21.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34974099.0,17199099.0,5.75,2.2,95612307.5388973

Captain Miller  and his crew —Lieutenant Starck , pilot Smith , Medical Technician Peters , Engineer Ensign Justin , Rescue Technician Cooper , and Trauma Doctor D.J.  —are joined for the mission by the Event Horizon's designer Dr. William Weir . Dr. Weir briefs the crew that the Event Horizon was built to test an experimental gravity drive which generates an artificial black hole to use the immense gravitational power to bridge two points in spacetime, greatly reducing travel time over astronomical distances. Upon arriving at the ship's decaying orbit around Neptune and boarding the Event Horizon to search for survivors, the crew finds evidence of a massacre. During the search, the ship's gravity drive activates automatically. Justin is pulled into the resulting portal, returning in a catatonic state. He is later placed in stasis after a failed suicide attempt in apprehension over the events he witnessed during his crossover. The activation of the gravity drive causes a massive shockwave which critically damages the Lewis and Clark and forces the entire crew to board the Event Horizon. The crew then begins experiencing hallucinations of their fears and regrets: Miller sees a subordinate, Corrick, he was forced to abandon in a fire; Peters sees images of her son Denny with his legs covered in bloody lesions; and Dr. Weir, a widower, sees his wife Claire with missing eyes, urging him to join her. After deciphering a warning from a video log of the Event Horizon's crew going insane and mutilating each other, Miller and D.J. deduce that while the ship's gravity drive did successfully open a gateway in spacetime, it leapt outside the known universe and into another dimension, described later on by Dr. Weir as ""a dimension of pure chaos, pure evil"" . The Event Horizon has since then gained an evil sentience and telekinetic abilities, tormenting its occupants with the aim of compelling them to return to Hell. Miller decides to destroy the Event Horizon despite objections from Dr. Weir, who is seduced and eventually possessed by the evil presence and uses an explosive device from the Event Horizon to destroy the Lewis and Clark. Smith is killed in the explosion which also launches Cooper out of the ship and into space. Peters dies from a long fall after being lured into the engineering section by an apparition of her son. Dr. Weir kills D.J. by vivisecting him and corners Starck on the bridge. Miller tries to rescue Starck but is caught by Dr. Weir, who activates the ship's gravity drive, initiating a ten minute countdown after which the Event Horizon and its passengers will return to the other dimension. Cooper, having used his space suit's oxygen to propel him back to the ship, tries to contact those inside, and Dr. Weir retaliates by shooting out the bridge window. Dr. Weir is blown out into space by the ensuing decompression while Miller, Starck, and Cooper survive and manage to seal off the bridge area of the ship. Miller then resolves to detonate the explosives installed on the Event Horizon to split the ship in two and use the forward section of the ship as a lifeboat. He is attacked by manifestations of Corrick and Dr. Weir, who shows Miller horrifying visions of the Lewis and Clark's crew being tortured and mutilated once they return to Hell. Miller fights off the manifestation and manages to detonate the explosives, sacrificing himself so Justin, Cooper, and Starck can escape. The gravity drive activates, pulling the rear of the ship into a wormhole. Starck and Cooper join Justin in stasis and wait to be rescued. 72 days later, the Event Horizon is located by a rescue party, who discover the remaining crew still in stasis. Starck has a nightmare of the scarred Dr. Weir being one of the rescuers and is awakened in a distraught state by a rescue team. Cooper restrains Starck and one of the rescuers calls for a sedative as the doors to the stasis room ominously seem to close by themselves.space marine nightmare hallucination cryogenics space travel black hole insanity delusion crew alternate dimension flashback evil spirit hellgate religion explosion violence burning man rescue team super power trapped in space distress signal",False,tt0119081,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,26673242,0,0,-1.2494453430145462,-0.16960090051826512,,,-12124376.6,15875623.4,,,1554476.0,7,2554476.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,132166076.0,13.0,162916076.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,36333053.666666664,57333053.666666664,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1569178.0,5430822.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,29357676.0,46357676.0,1.0,36986020.5,56486020.5,4.0,,,,,,,109773545.0,159773545.0,1.0,,,,97608490.0,121775156.66666667,3.0,-1183023.5,3066976.5,2.0,11737911.0,23237911.0,1.0,143622207.5,167872207.5,2.0,,,,130565716.0,170399049.33333334,3.0,,,,,,,,,82735276.0,66860276.0,2.5,1.5,107279251.96773516

Her mother Mari nicknamed her Little Voice because of her shyness. Entranced by her late father’s array of vintage songs by Édith Piaf, Judy Garland, and Shirley Bassey, among others, she flees from her dreary existence by impersonating these singers. Mari, a profligate woman who engages in numerous affairs, discards her lovers as soon her interest falters. Her search for a long-time companion has so far been futile. Billy, a meek phone installer who comes to repair the family phone, soon shows interest in LV by sending her pamphlets. Her solitary existence shows signs of improvement when Ray Say, a manager of third-rate acts, becomes romantically involved with her mother. He overhears LV singing, recognises her prowess and determines to make her the star she declines to be, whereas Mari, who finds LV’s singing annoying and therefore disdains her, doubts her talent. Ray nonetheless asks his manager to showcase LV at his rather louche nightclub, where the girl quells her fear by imagining her father in the audience, and performs a couple of numbers that enrapture the crowd and argue her talent. For example, her voice is suffused with eroticism as she mimics Marilyn Monroe. Ray Say, who relishes the prospect of LV being a successful performer, tries to goad his newfound protégée into a singing career, but to no avail. Problems ensue when Little Voice retreats into privacy and boycotts a much-heralded appearance attended by an esteemed press agent. Ray Say’s hopes are extinguished when his attempts to console LV remain fruitless. Mari, who still scorns LV despite recognising her talent, prods her daughter into further performances without noticing the effect this has on LV. When a fire destroys LV’s records, Mari wrongly accuses her daughter of setting their house ablaze.

Crowther, Posner, Dakin, Timms, Akthar, Lockwood, Scripps, and Rudge have recently obtained the school's highest ever A-level scores and are hoping to enter Oxford or Cambridge, taking a seventh-term entrance exam in History. The General Studies teacher, known by staff and boys alike by his nickname ""Hector"" , is their favourite, and works alongside their deputy head and regular History teacher, Mrs. Lintott . The headmaster, Felix , hires an energetic young contract teacher named Irwin  to assist Hector and Mrs Lintott in preparing the boys for the Oxbridge entrance exams. Irwin's style is utterly different from Hector's and Mrs. Lintott's; while the older teachers emphasise cultural and factual knowledges and the quest for truth, Irwin urges the boys to put a spin on their historical analysis, to value originality above objective truth. As the plot progresses we learn that Hector habitually offers some of his students rides home on his motorcycle and surreptitiously fondles his passengers. The boys have all come to a mutual understanding on the subject and, while mildly annoyed, laugh off their teacher's advances and more or less willingly continue to take turns riding home on the back of his bike. This practice eventually lands Hector in trouble as he is reported to the headmaster by a lollipop lady who witnesses his action. The headmaster insists that Hector retire early, and also that Hector and Irwin share a class; when they do, the group engages in a tense discussions such as about how best to analyse the Holocaust. As part of their General Studies the class acts out scenes from romantic films and literature, and Posner ([[Samuel Barnett  sings a love song – Rodgers and Hart's ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"" – which he pointedly directs towards Dakin . Later he seeks out Irwin to discuss his attraction to Dakin. Dakin, who characterises himself as an aspiring lecher, is currently pursuing an affair with the headmaster's secretary, Fiona . He is not displeased by Posner's attention, but finds himself interested by Irwin. Gradually, Dakin's quest to impress Irwin on an intellectual level evolves into a flirtatious, potentially sexual pursuit of his young teacher – who, as Posner, his friend Scripps  and even Hector note, is visibly attracted to Dakin. After interviews, when the boys receive their replies through the post, it seems that they have all gained Oxbridge places, except for the group's gauche sportsman, Rudge . When Mrs Lintott questions him, it turns out that Rudge had already been told at interview that he has a place, due to a family connection with the college . Dakin approaches Irwin in his classroom after the celebrations and reveals that he found no record of Irwin's attendance at Corpus, the Oxford college he claimed as his alma mater, and Irwin confesses that he lied about his past. Dakin then, ""as a thank you"", invites Irwin to give him a blowjob. They make an appointment to ""have a drink"" on Sunday. Dakin tells Irwin that he has seen two sides to Irwin—a reckless, challenging intellectual whilst teaching but an uptight, cautious personality in real life—and he cannot reconcile them. Dakin then proceeds to the Headmaster's office and, by threatening to reveal Felix's own sexual harassment of Fiona, forces him to reinstate Hector. The boys prepare to leave the grammar school at the end of that term, and Hector agrees to give Dakin a ride home on the motorbike ""for old times' sake"". However, before they leave, the headmaster runs out and stops them, saying that Hector should not take one of the boys. He suggests that Hector take Irwin instead. Dakin gladly hands the helmet to him, and the screen fades to white as they drive off, the boys waving happily and laughing. Fast forward to a few days later, as it is revealed that the bike was in an accident on the way home, possibly caused by Irwin, never before having ridden on the back of a motorbike, leaning the wrong way on a corner. Irwin was badly injured and suffered total memory loss of his conversation with Dakin; Hector did not survive. At the memorial service, the boys sing ""Bye Bye Blackbird"" and the headmaster gives a trite eulogy. The scene then changes abruptly to an almost empty hall with only the eight boys and Mrs. Lintott present. ""Will they come to my funeral, I wonder,"" Mrs Lintott remarks, before recounting the futures of the eight boys. They have entered a variety of careers: Akthar a headmaster, Crowther a magistrate, Timms the owner of a dry cleaning chain who takes drugs at weekends, Dakin a tax lawyer. Lockwood , who entered the army, died as a result of friendly fire at the age of 28 while serving in the York and Lancaster Regiment . Rudge has become a builder, Scripps a journalist, and Irwin stops teaching and becomes a maker of TV history documentaries. Finally, Posner reveals he has become a teacher who followed in Hector's footsteps, with similar ambivalence and angst, though without ""touching the boys"", which is ""always a struggle. But maybe that's why I'm a good teacher"". The film ends with a collection of moments involving Hector, leading up to the moment that a photograph of the entire class was taken at Fountains Abbey, a scene from earlier in the film. The photo spans the entire screen, and the closing credits are played over the photo.gay becoming an adult education exam northern england high school scholarship oxford cambridge yorkshire history based on play or musical teacher student high school teacher history teacher headmaster boys' school teachers and students 1980s",False,tt0464049,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,13401952,1,0,2.350488,-3.847336948521819,108226540.33333333,125226540.33333333,11858013.5,20428013.5,-211943.16666666666,8468056.833333334,,0,,,,0.0,,,-8815745.0,4.0,184255.0,1.0,-6433260.5,20.0,5066739.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,12909684.6,34209684.6,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-884109.0,5282557.666666667,3.0,1818479.0,7818479.0,1.0,,,,104280263.0,109280263.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,67954044.0,87754044.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,2625497.25,-7624502.75,3.0,1.5,92887866.92008553

The ship is led by Captain Alexei Vostrikov , aided by executive officer Mikhail Polenin . Polenin, the original captain, and the crew have served together for some time but Vostrikov's appointment is alleged to have been aided by his wife's political connections . During his first inspection, Vostrikov discovers the submarine's reactor officer to be drunk and asleep on duty. Against Polenin's advice that the man is ""the best reactor officer in the fleet"", Vostrikov sacks the officer and orders Polenin to request a replacement. The new reactor officer  arrives direct from the naval academy and has never been to sea. Also, during the preparation period for the sub's launch, the ship's medical officer is killed when struck by an oncoming truck, and is subsequently replaced by a naval doctor  who, while being a longtime veteran, also has never served at sea, and has no experience in radiologically based illnesses. During the K-19's official launch, the bottle of champagne fails to break when it strikes the bow; the sailors nervously glance at each other due to this customary sign of bad luck. K-19 puts to sea for her trials. Vostrikov orders a series of diving maneuvers during which he directs Polenin to simulate a number of emergencies including fires and flooding while he times the crew's response. He is not happy with their performance. There are a number of minor accidents during these exercises which result in injuries to crew members. In addition, Vostrikov points out to Polenin that the crew are too slow and slipshod in their reaction and completion of these exercises. The crew begin to grumble about Vostrikov's demanding orders and authoritarian manner, but Polenin silences them when he visits the crew's quarters: ""I heard there'd been some complaining. I thought, 'Not from my crew. Not on my boat'."" Meanwhile, Vostrikov blames the officers for the crew's under-performance, accusing them of being soft on the men and lacking leadership. The crew's performance improves and Vostrikov decides to carry out the K-19's first mission, which is to surface in the Arctic and fire an unarmed  ballistic missile. Vostrikov orders the K-19 to submerge to maximum operational depth , then surface rapidly at full-speed to break through the Arctic pack-ice which he estimates to be no more than one metre thick. Polenin regards this maneuver as dangerous and, during the surfacing procedure, storms off the bridge. After scraping along the underside of the ice, the K-19 finally breaks through and surfaces with no apparent damage. The test missile is launched successfully and the crew are both relieved and exhilarated by Vostrikov's bold maneuver. The crew are allowed some time off during which they play football on the ice and a group photograph is taken. Talking privately with Polenin, the submarine's political officer, Suslov, expresses some confidence in Vostrikov, but Polenin asserts that the captain was ""lucky today, that's all."" K-19 then receives new orders, to sail down through the North Atlantic and patrol off the US east coast ""between Washington and New York."" As the K-19 sails southwards, a pipe carrying coolant to the reactor cooling system springs a leak and then bursts completely. The control rods are inserted to stop the reactor, but without coolant the reactor temperature continues to rise rapidly. Polenin and the reactor officer, Radtchenko, are shocked to discover that back-up coolant systems have not been installed. Vostrikov orders the K-19 to surface so that he may contact fleet command to inform them of the accident and await orders. But upon surfacing they discover the long-range transmitter on the conning tower is damaged and they are unable to contact fleet headquarters — Vostrikov assumes, ruefully, his surfacing maneuver in the Arctic caused the antenna damage. The reactor crew discuss options. Radtchenko informs them that if the reactor temperature exceeds 1000° Celsius it will result in a catastrophic explosion and may trigger the detonation of the submarine's nuclear warheads as well, and they estimate that they have three to four hours before this happens. The other option is that they try to cool down the reactor by opening it, they will be directly exposed and the whole crew would die from the radiation poisoning. Some suggest sending out a distress call on the submarine's short-range transmitter and abandoning and scuttling the ship. Vostrikov refuses to consider such an idea. Pavel Loktev, the senior reactor technician, suggests piping the K-19's drinking water into the reactor with which to cool it. But in order to do this they need to construct a system of pipes to transfer the water. Vostrikov approves the plan and the crew work feverishly, cannibalizing the submarine to construct the piping system. The final phase requires sailors to enter the radiation-filled reactor room to weld the pipes together. In order to restrict exposure to the deadly, leaking radiation, they require three teams of two, working for no more than ten minutes at a time. Vostrikov calls for volunteers. Pavel and another crewman, Anatoly Zubachev, volunteer to be the first team, but Vostrikov has to order others into the reactor. He orders Radtchenko in as part of the last team, to inspect the success of the welds. Polenin and the radiation safety officer then discover the K-19 has no radiation suits, only chemical suits. ""They might as well wear raincoats!"", exclaims Polenin. Nevertheless, with no other option, he lies to the men and tells them the chemical suits will protect them. The first team enter the reactor and begin welding. Emerging ten minutes later and removing the suits, they are both suffering from severe radiation poisoning and are carried to their quarters where the doctor attends to them. The second team enters. Meanwhile, on the bridge, the captain, officers, and crew monitor the reactor temperature which is climbing steadily. In the reactor room, the second team emerges just as badly poisoned as the first and are carried away. It is time for the third team to go in, but Radtchenko is overcome with fear and cannot bring himself to enter the reactor. Chief engineer Gorelov volunteers to go in his place. They complete the welding and to everyone's relief the reactor temperature begins to fall — the plan seems to have worked. But the submarine is beginning to fill with radiation as the reactor door is now breached, to allow the coolant pipe access. Polenin wants to seek help from a nearby NATO base on Jan Mayen. Vostrikov refuses to surrender his boat or crew and orders the K-19 to sail towards the USSR, under radio silence, in the hope that they will meet up with another Soviet submarine; Polenin is doubtful this plan will succeed as it relies on luck. Vostrikov is informed that a helicopter is approaching; he and some of the crew climb out onto the deck, thinking a Russian ship has come to save them, only to discover that it is a US Navy helicopter from a nearby US destroyer. The destroyer is asking if the K-19 requires assistance. Vostrikov orders a reply in the negative; the men on the deck notice a crewman in the helicopter photographing them, and they drop their trousers and bare their buttocks at him. The helicopter flies away. Vostrikov refuses to allow the Americans anywhere near K-19. The US destroyer follows them at a discreet distance. Demichev, the torpedo officer, meets with Suslov in private. He reminds the political officer that he is empowered to remove Vostrikov as captain, if he judges Vostrikov to be jeopardizing the mission. After a few hours and with no 'friendly' ship sighted, the weld connecting the temporary coolant pipe to the reactor fails and the reactor temperature again begins to rise dangerously. Radtchenko dons a useless safety suit and enters the reactor alone to fix the broken weld. Vostrikov again orders the K-19 to submerge, rather than abandon ship, angering the men. As the K-19 dives some torpedo fuel, spilled when the torpedo was stripped for pipes, ignites resulting in a fire in the aft torpedo room. Polenin refuses the captain's order to implement the fire suppression system, which would kill the men fighting the fire, but goes forward to supervise the effort. When he is gone, Demichev and Suslov produce pistols and point them at Vostrikov, and the Suslov announces he is replacing Vostrikov with Polenin as captain of the submarine, and to surface immediately. Vostrikov is handcuffed to a ladder. With the torpedo room fire extinguished, Polenin returns and is told what has happened. ""Good,"" he says and asks for Demichev and Suslov to hand over their weapons to him. They do so and Polenin immediately orders Vostrikov to be released and Demichev and Suslov to be placed under arrest. Polenin admonishes them for the attempted mutiny and re-affirms Vostrikov as the captain of the K-19. Vostrikov then attempts to re-order the crew of the K-19 to submerge, but Polenin interrupts him to say ""Don't order them; ask them."" Vostrikov explains the situation. If the reactor and the ballistic missiles explode while the K-19 is surfaced, the resulting nuclear blast will destroy not only the K-19 but also the nearby US navy ship and, most likely, the NATO base as well. As the K-19 has been unable to inform anyone in the outside world of her predicament, the United States, the Soviet Union, or anyone else will only know that a huge nuclear explosion has destroyed a U.S. warship and NATO base; that such a disaster could trigger World War III. The crew appreciate their wider duty and prepare to dive deep and scuttle the submarine. But Radtchenko has spent 18 minutes in the reactor successfully fixing the weld, and the temperature begins to drop again as Vostrikov himself drags the fatally poisoned officer from the reactor. Just as Vostrikov orders the men off the boat so that he can scuttle it, they are rescued by another Soviet submarine. Vostrikov wants to move his crew to the other submarine, away from the radiation, but permission is not granted. He moves the crew anyway. Polenin warns him that he will be sent to the gulag, just like his father, for disobeying orders. Vostrikov smiles and says, ""It's a family tradition, isn't it?"" Afterwards, during a formal inquiry of the events, Polenin speaks highly of Captain Vostrikov, and rebukes the convened tribunal for the hostile interrogations of both Vostrikov, and the radiation afflicted crew, even going so far as to say: ""None of you...none of you...has the right to judge Captain Vostrikov. You weren't there! I was! He was our captain! He was my captain. And it would be an honor to sail under his command again."" The inquiry acquits Vostrikov of any wrongdoing in the end, but he is never given command of another Soviet submarine again. An epilogue shows an aged Captain Vostrikov in 1989, putting on his dress uniform in a small flat and catching a train to meet up with Polenin. It is exactly 28 years after the accident; the Berlin Wall is shown to be coming down. Vostrikov grumbles about the inconvenience but Polenin informs him this is the anniversary of the day they were rescued. The commanders enter a cemetery where a number of the surviving K-19 crewmen are gathered by a gravesite. We learn that this is the first time the K-19 survivors have met since the incident; they were ordered never to meet or discuss the incident after the inquiry. Vostrikov is visibly moved as he greets the men and informs them that he nominated the men now dead of radiation poisoning  for the distinction of Hero of the Soviet Union, but was told they were not ""worthy"" of the title as they died not in battle, but as the result of an accident. The men drink a toast to their deceased comrades, and a flashback of the crew posing for the photograph on the ice is shown.submarine cold war soviet union core melt north atlantic based on a true story nuclear woman director 1960s nuclear submarine",False,tt0267626,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,35168966,0,0,-1.8434159821474416,0.06660377319308829,-1616654.0,32716679.333333332,6768298.8,22868298.8,,,3549471.5,24,20049471.5,2.0,-7703242.833333333,19.0,15380090.5,6.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,266689294.0,6.0,320689294.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,70017974.0,92275116.85714285,7.0,,,,,,,,,,98376005.0,117626005.0,2.0,97091208.0,162091208.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,402208848.0,424208848.0,1.0,27231879.0,40031879.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,118706285.33333333,87511840.8888889,6.125,3.0,95886927.05495417

Her proposal initially is met with great skepticism, but she eventually convinces ten women to participate in the project with her. They enlist one of the hospital workers, an amateur photographer named Lawrence, to help them with the concept. The head of the local Women's Institute chapter refuses to sanction the calendar, and Chris and Annie go to a national congress of the Women's Institute in London to plead their case. They are told the final decision rests with the local leader, who grudgingly agrees to the calendar's sale. The initial printing quickly sells out, and before long the tiny village is bombarded with members of the international media anxious to report the feel-good story. The women are invited to appear on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in Los Angeles. While there, tensions arise between Chris and Annie. All the publicity surrounding the calendar has taken a toll on their personal lives, and they lash out at each other in angry frustration. Annie accuses Chris of ignoring her husband and son and the demands of the family business in favour of her newfound celebrity, while Chris believes Annie welcomes the Mother Teresa-like status to which she's been elevated that allows her to cater to the ill and bereaved who have bombarded her with fan mail. All is resolved eventually, and the women return home to resume life as it was before they removed their clothing.england nudity mannequin northern england leukemia calendar yorkshire based on a true story",False,tt0337909,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,96542059,1,0,8.654205900000001,-14.415123713336484,9447833.0,30197833.0,,,,,45960740.5,22,61360740.5,2.0,104280263.0,3.0,109280263.0,1.0,,0.0,,,24400000.0,4.0,28200000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-13158562.5,6.0,1591437.5,2.0,,0.0,,,-22185580.0,32814420.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16330482.0,26330482.0,1.0,5112895.0,62112895.0,1.0,35513815.666666664,41847149.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16559495.5,40809495.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,18900000.0,25900000.0,1.0,,,,565664454.5,667164454.5,2.0,,,50108110.25,40370610.25,4.375,1.5,79569518.43496008

Shortly after, led by their leader the “Fantom”, the men dressed as British officers kidnap German scientists and destroy a factory, causing tension between England and Germany which could lead to war, with both attacks marked by highly advanced weaponry  such as tanks and machine guns. Sanderson Reed of the British Empire ventures to Kenya, visiting a gentlemen’s club to recruit world-renowned hunter and adventurer Allan Quartermain. Quartermain has no interest in helping, having retired and mourns the loss of his son after his last adventure. Assassins arrive to kill Quartermain but he defeats them, only for a bomb to destroy the club, forcing Quartermain to agree to work with Reed. In London, Quartermain meets “M”, Reed’s employer, who explains the Fantom plans to destroy Venice to prevent a meeting between the leaders of the world, his ultimate goal being to start a world war and arms race to profit from sale of his weapons. To combat the Fantom, a team of unique individuals known as the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is being formed – consisting of Quartermain himself, Captain Nemo, chemist Mina Harker, and invisible thief Rodney Skinner. M sends the group to recruit their fifth member, immortal Dorian Gray, who remains youthful while a currently missing portrait of himself ages. Dorian once was infatuated with Mina, but refuses to join the team. The Fantom and his assassins attack, but thanks to the presence of U.S. Secret Service Agent Tom Sawyer, who snuck in, the assassins are defeated although the Fantom escapes. Mina is revealed to be a vampire when a surviving assassin tries to take her hostage. Dorian and Sawyer join the team and set off to recruit their final member, Mr. Hyde, in Captain Nemo’s ship, the Nautilus. After capturing Hyde in Paris, Quartermain negotiates with him into joining the team by offering amnesty for his past crimes. Hyde agrees, turning into his harmless self, Dr. Jekyll. On the way to Venice, Quartermain bonds with Sawyer and teaches him to be a better marksman. It eventually becomes clear there is a traitor onboard when a camera’s flash powder is found in the ship’s wheelhouse and one of Dr. Jekyll’s transformation formulas goes missing. Skinner is quickly accused of being the saboteur, but he disappears. Arriving in Venice, the league are shocked when bombs planted beneath the city begin to destroy building in a domino effect but Nemo concludes they can stop the chain reaction by destroying a building out of sequence using one of the Nautilus’ missiles. Quartermain, Sawyer, Mina and Dorian take Nemo’s automobile to outrun the chain reaction with Dorian and Mina leaping out to fight the Fantom’s men. Quartermain spots the Fantom and confronts him, revealing him to be none other than M. Sawyer manages to signal for the missile to be launched and Venice is saved. Dorian returns to the ship and kills Nemo’s first mate Ishmael, revealing he is the traitor. The league learns of M and Dorian’s treachery, who escape in an exploration pod. A phonograph record made by M is found, M explaining his true goal was to gather physical elements of the team  to make superhuman formulas to sell to the highest paying countries, with Dorian revealing bombs are hidden on the ship. The bombs detonate, damaging the ship, but Hyde drains the flooding water from the Nautilus’ engine rooms. Skinner, who stowed away on Dorian’s pod, messages the group to follow his lead. The Nautilus travels to the Arctic where the league reunites with Skinner. Skinner reveals M runs a factory where the kidnapped scientists are forced to make the superhuman formulas and weaponized versions of the Nautilus are being constructed. The league break into the factory and split up to stop M – Nemo and Hyde free the scientists and their families, Skinner sets bombs to destroy the factory, Mina goes to kill Dorian, and Quartermain and Sawyer go after M, who is revealed to be Professor James Moriarty, who was believed to have died in his battle with Sherlock Holmes. Mina confronts Dorian and kills him by exposing his portrait to him. Quartermain fights Moriarty who points out Sawyer has been taken captive by an invisible Reed. Quartermain shoots Reed, but is then stabbed by Moriarty who escapes out of a window with the collection of formulas. Sawyer manages to use Quartermain’s teachings to shoot Moriarty dead from afar, the formulas sinking into the icy waters below. Quartermain dies but tells Sawyer to enjoy the new century. Quartermain is buried in Kenya beside his son, but the other league members recall how he said that a witch doctor would never let him die as long as he was in Africa. After Sawyer, Mina, Nemo, Skinner and Dr. Jekyll depart, the witch doctor appears and uses a ritual to summon a bolt of lightning which strikes Quartermain’s grave, implying the hunter is to be resurrected as promised.saving the world venice, italy vampire bite men superhero based on comic invisible person captain nemo allan quatermain immortal",True,tt0311429,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,179265204,0,0,1.2982718461538458,-14.415123713336484,,,,,,,57156628.4,41,73696961.73333333,15.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-2697796.0,6.0,302204.0,1.0,,0.0,,,23387071.333333332,8.0,44837071.333333336,3.0,-10887043.0,6.0,1612957.0,1.0,,,,75253168.33333333,98753168.33333333,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40169144.0,84169144.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-6439124.0,7060876.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16742935.5,31742935.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30112298.516666666,16739715.183333334,7.625,5.0,79569518.43496008

Doctor Carmack ([[Robert Russell  transmits a warning about a Level 5 security breach before the door behind him is torn open. He turns around and sees a large humanoid creature through the gap. On Earth, a team of eight Marines -  known as the RRTS Hellfighters  are preparing to go on leave. Their leave is cancelled when the squad leader, Sarge , receives new orders. Contact with Olduvai has been lost and the RRTS is being sent to investigate. The Mars station is quarantined and the 85 UAC employees on Mars are not allowed to return to Earth. As the men suit up, Sarge pulls aside John ""Reaper"" Grimm  and asks him not to go because Olduvai is where Reaper's parents died and his sister is still on the station. Reaper suits up anyway, and their team is deployed to Mars via a teleportation device called the ""Ark"", located at Area 51. The Ark was discovered in 2026, and scientists have been studying it. The team meets an early victim of the Ark system, Pinky , who ""went to one galaxy while his ass went to another"" during an Ark teleportation event . They meet up with Dr. Samantha Grimm , Reaper's sister. She briefs the RRTS that Doctor Carmacks division of the facility focused on genetic research has been quarantined off, with Carmack and five other scientists sealed inside. Sarge instructs his team that their mission is to eliminate the threat, secure the facility and retrieve UAC property; Dr. Grimm going into the genetics lab with the squad to recover Carmack's research data. Reaper converses with his sister and learns that they discovered humanoid remains on Mars, which, unlike humans, have an extra chromosome pair which granted them invulnerability to disease as well as advanced cellular regeneration. The team locates Carmack, who has gone mad to the point of tearing off his own ear. They return him to the lab and Grimm sedates him. The Marines explore the facility, encountering two of the five remaining scientists only to discover that they have been transformed into zombies, forcing them to kill them. After spotting and chasing a large creature through the facility, the team follows it into the sewer system, discovering the bloodied lab coat of a 'Doctor Steve Willits'. Whilst the team is split up, an Imp ambushes Goat  and causes a mortal wound on his throat before being killed by Reaper and brought to Dr. Grimm, alongside the wounded Goat. Despite the best efforts of the RRTS, Goat dies in the lab. In response to the event, Sarge orders the 85 workers in the facility to evacuate back to Earth through the Ark with the exception of Dr. Grimm and Pinky, the latter being left to guard the Ark. After the evacuations are complete, Duke  remains with Dr. Grimm whilst she examines the remains of the Imp, and the two notice that Doctor Carmack has vanished from the infirmary. Moments later outside the lab they are attacked by an Imp which manages to lightly wound Duke before Dr. Grimm closes a nanowall on the creature, keeping it alive but trapping it halfway through the wall. Shortly afterwards, Dr. Grimm conducts an autopsy of the deceased Imp and discovers that it was once human. A second later Duke notices that Goat has returned to life as a zombie and broken free of the body bag containing him. Retaining some shred of his humanity and aware that he is turning, Goat prevents it by violently smashing his head into the observation room window to kill himself once again. Meanwhile, the rest of the RRTS return to the genetics lab and begin exploring the archeological digsite in the facility. While searching the caverns, the team discovers the bodies of two more of Carmack's scientists, leaving only Doctor Willits still unaccounted for. While Sarge and Reaper examine the bodies, Mac  is ambushed and immediately decapitated by the Hell Knight, the large humanoid monster seen prior. Convinced that the team is going to need some additional firepower to take on the creature, Sarge uses the severed hand of one of the scientists and takes the Bio Force Gun, dubbing it the ""Big Fucking Gun."" Elsewhere, Portman  leaves his post to use the restroom, leaving Destroyer  alone. In reality, Portman is going against Sarge's orders to maintain quarantine by sending out a transmission to Earth to request RRTS reinforcements. At the same time, Destroyer is attacked by the Hell Knight and thrown into a pit with electrified walls used as a prison cell. The two engage in a brutal melee fight before Destroyer manages to pin the Hell Knight to the electrified wall with a large pipe, attempting to climb a hanging chain out of the pit. Unfortunately as he reaches the top, the Hell Knight breaks loose and pulls the chain down, causing Destroyer to fall to his death. Shortly after the fight concludes, Portman successfully sends his transmission to Earth and is abruptly attacked by the Hell Knight which proceeds to hang him upside down from the ceiling and smash him violently through the stall walls. By time the rest of the RRTS arrive to help him he is dead and Sarge fails to hit the Hell Knight with the BFG before it retreats again. After being brought the bodies of Portman and Destroyer, Dr. Grimm determines that the genetics of the creatures have been altered by the addition of the 24th Martian chromosome, which led to their mutations and that the chromosome is spread by the ovipositors of those infected. She also reveals that the Imp trapped halfway through the nanowall is in fact Doctor Carmack, as identified due to his missing ear. She theorizes that the Imp killed in the sewers is the missing Doctor Willits. Losing his patience with Grimm, Sarge executes the transformed Carmack and interrogates her for an explanation of their research. After reviewing the research data Grimm collected from Carmack's lab, video footage is discovered which reveals that Carmack and his team deliberately injected the chromosome into a man named Curtis Stahl, a prisoner convicted of multiple murders before being given to the UAC instead of facing execution. The footage revealed that Stahl mutated into the Hell Knight, which led to him breaking loose and killing / infecting the research team. With four men KIA, the squad is reduced to Sarge, Reaper, The Kid , and Duke. The team realize that the Hell Knight is cutting through the vault door into the Ark in an attempt to escape to Earth. Sarge orders Pinky to detonate an ST grenade that Mac left him to destroy the Ark and prevent it from getting through. However, Pinky fails to and instead retreats through the Ark back to Earth and the Hell Knight chases him through. Sarge confirms the mission is no longer containment and orders the RRTS to head back to Earth to eliminate the Hell Knight. Reaper returns to the lab to bring Dr. Grimm, who reveals that the ovipositor of the creatures are selectively choosing what humans to infect. Reaper and Dr. Grimm theorize that the creatures pick up on genetic markers to make their decision, impulsively trying to infect people with ""evil"" tendencies  while ignoring those with more of a ""good"" personality . Dr. Grimm explains that the 24th chromosome would turn ""good"" people into super humans like the remains found on Mars, while those who are ""evil"" are turned into monsters. Meanwhile, the rest of the RRTS reach the UAC facility on Earth and find it full of corpses, the researchers from Olduvai and the base staff having been slaughtered by the Hell Knight when it came through. With the facility on automatic lock down to prevent anyone from leaving, the RRTS have a single hour before the lock down is lifted and the creatures can escape the facility. Sarge orders his men to kill anything alive in order to prevent the infection from spreading, leading them on a cleanup operation through the facility that leads them to kill a considerable number of UAC employees transformed into zombies. However, Sarge shows no distinction between targets and even kills survivors who do not show immediate signs of infection. While confirming the bodies in the facility are really dead, Duke discovers Pinky hiding under a pile of bodies and brings him back to the Ark chamber where Reaper and Dr. Grimm are trying to convince Sarge that not everyone is capable of being infected due to their ""good"" genes. Sarge doesn't heed them and prepares to execute Pinky before The Kid rushes into the room, stating that he found a large group of non-infected humans. Sarge orders him to return and kill them but The Kid refuses, resulting in Sarge executing him for insubordination. Reaper prepares to retaliate for the murder before Pinky aims a pistol at Sarge, ordering him to drop his rifle. The stand off is abruptly cut short when the Hell Knight enters the room, grabbing Pinky and fleeing into the halls with him in tow. The RRTS attempt to chase the creature down before they run directly into a horde of Zombies, making their stand at a nanowall that is malfunctioning and failing to shut. Duke is suddenly pulled through a vent in the floor by an Imp and killed while the zombies drag Sarge through the nanowall. Just then, the nanowall shuts and Reaper is hit in the gut by a ricochet from his own rifle. The two siblings flee the area and barricade themselves in a storage room. To save Reaper's life, Dr. Grimm injects Reaper with Chomosome 24. Instead of becoming a monster, Reaper awakens as a superhuman with enhanced speed, strength and healing abilities, his gunshot wound and other inflicted injuries having healed. Following Reaper's transformation and the discovery that Dr. Grimm is missing, the movie takes on a first-person shooter perspective. Within a few minutes, Reaper moves through the facility and slays an array of zombies and Imps, eventually having a showdown with the Hell Knight after severely burning it. Reaper successfully manages to kill the Hell Knight when he detonates a planted mine at its feet, blowing it to pieces. Shortly after, Reaper is attacked by Pinky, who has now transformed into a Demon after the Hell Knight infected him. After an intense and brutal fight, Reaper manages to incapacitate Pinky with the Hell Knight's chainsaw and proceeds to finish him off with his rifle. Switching back to a standard camera angle, Reaper emerges at the facility's exit. Bodies are scattered everywhere, and a melted blue hole in the wall, the mark of a BFG blast, is still cooling. Reaper finds Dr. Grimm lying on the floor, injured but alive. Sarge then appears, seemingly none the worse for wear, but Reaper notices the same injury on Sarge that Carmack had before he turned into an Imp. When asked what happened to the non-infected survivors, Sarge replies that he ""took care of that problem""- he has killed them. Reaper tells Dr. Grimm to crawl to the elevator to the surface, intent on not letting Sarge leave the facility with the lock down only minutes from being lifted. After spending their last ammunition- Reaper's half of a magazine and Sarge's one round in the BFG, the two Marines battle hand to hand in the Ark chamber with their superhuman abilities. As Sarge manages to pin Reaper against a wall, he begins transforming, developing features such as a prominent skull structure, sharp teeth and yellow eyes. Without any other choice, Reaper activates the Ark and throws Sarge through, followed by a grenade. Sarge lands back in the Mars facility and soon notices the grenade. He and the Ark are obliterated in the explosion. Reaper retrieves Dr. Grimm, who is conscious but unable to walk, and holds her in his arms as he returns to the Earth's surface.teleportation based on video game severed ear future war wisecrack humor commando mission",True,tt0419706,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,55987321,0,0,-0.07167120927254228,-2.6760407675788414,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,192559531.5,3.0,276559531.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,84394835.0,1.0,129394835.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,67718567.0,169385233.66666666,3.0,-10730514.0,119269486.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,126453064.85714285,152524493.42857143,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17316267.0,105316267.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17316267.0,105316267.0,1.0,-74010360.0,5989640.0,1.0,,,,19740414.333333332,32157081.0,6.0,101224533.5,175224533.5,2.0,100419323.2,183419323.2,5.0,,,202977183.25,138477183.25,0.5,1.5,109858494.28372188

His friend, the photographer Kevin Swain's  ex-girlfriend, a former model named Martine Love  offers Terry a chance to earn enough money to never worry about debt again: a bank robbery in Baker Street, London, where she has critical details. Terry gathers his petty-criminal friends, including Kevin, a sometime pornographic actor Dave Shilling , a mechanic named Bambas , and an elegant con-man ""Major"" Guy Singer ([[James Faulkner . While scouting the branch of Lloyds Bank, Terry and Martine inspect the vault while Kevin and Dave case the exterior. The Soho gangster Lew Vogel , who keeps records of his police payoffs at the same branch, happens upon Kevin and Dave, the latter of whom has made some films for Vogel. Vogel does not immediately suspect anything is amiss. The newly-formed gang leases a leather accessories shop two lots away from the bank, and dig a tunnel under a fast-food restaurant to reach the underground bank vault. Terry employs Eddie Burton , one of his garage workers, as a watchman with a walkie-talkie on a nearby roof. Martine, once caught smuggling heroin into Britain and wanting to avoid jail, has set up the gang for this job on behalf of MI5, which desires the contents of a certain safe deposit box, No. 118. This box contains compromising photos of a British Royal . Martine is having an affair with ambitious MI5 operative Tim Everett ; the photos and box belong to a black militant gangster who calls himself Michael X ; he uses the photos to avoid trouble with the Metropolitan Police, and MI5 is charged with recovering the photos. As the gang digs, their radio chatter draws the attention of a local amateur radio operator, who realises a robbery is in progress. He calls the police, who search their ten-mile radius and listen for concrete details to pin the robbery down. Terry's crew enter and loot the vault, as Martine goes for the photo deposit-box. A suspicious Terry opens it with her and, upon seeing the pictures, wonders if Martine has a hidden agenda. Another box has many photos of high-ranking government officials, including a minister, in compromising positions in a local S&M brothel. The gang takes these with money and other valuables. Terry arranges for alternate transportation ""to be safe"", throwing off MI5 which had intended to intercept them. Guy and Bambas escape with their share and Terry confronts Martine over the photos; she explains the unfolding predicament. With the robbery discovered, the police -— corrupt ones receiving payoffs and honest ones —- began separate investigations while MI5 continues their search. Also joining the search for Terry's crew is Vogel, an organised crime figure worried about the contents of his ledger, which lists payoffs he made to police, which was also stolen in the robbery. He informs Michael X that the Royal 'portraits' have gone missing, and Michael X becomes suspicious of Gale Benson , an MI5 spy who is sleeping with his American colleague Black Power militant, Hakim Jamal , and has travelled with him and Jamal to Trinidad, with instructions to find the Royal portraits. Recalling the chance encounter with Dave outside the bank before the robbery, Vogel has him tortured for information. Dave breaks and Vogel's associates go to Terry's garage and kidnap Eddie, the lookout. Meanwhile, a senior government minister, Lord Drysdale, is shown photos of himself in the brothel run by Sonia Bern , given by Terry to Tim and then to MI5 Executive Director Miles Urquhart ; Drysdale and Urquhart agree to cooperate in absolving the robbers and securing them safe passage, in exchange for covering up the mess. Meanwhile, MI5 issues a D-Notice forbidding press reports. Police simultaneously release recordings of the walkie-talkie conversations in the hope that someone will recognise the voices. These recordings are heard on the radio by Terry's young daughters, who tell their mother; her worries over Terry's absence increase. Vogel's accomplice, corrupt Detective Gerald Pyke , shoots Dave and threatens to shoot Eddie unless Vogel gets his ledger back. Vogel agrees with Terry to meet him at Paddington Station in London. Meanwhile, Guy and Bambas are murdered by persons unknown, and Michael X has Gale killed in Trinidad by associates. Terry has Kevin give updates to Detective Sergeant Roy Given , the officer in charge of the investigation, citing knowledge of corrupt officers under Vogel's control. He convinces Vogel to go to Paddington Station at the same time, offering him the ledger in return for Eddie's safe return. Terry heads to the rendezvous while Martine meets Tim, her original contact in MI5, overlooking the scene. Vogel and his corrupt police arrive with Eddie, but recognise the MI5 agents and run. The deputy head of MI5  exchanges the fresh passports Terry negotiated for the photos of the princess. Terry then chases Vogel and in a fight knocks out Vogel and his thugs, including corrupt Detective Nick Barton . Detective Given, officer in charge of the true investigation, arrives to see the robbers arrested. He speaks with the MI5 officers present, who direct police to let the bank robbers go. Terry gives the ledger to Given before he, Kevin, and Eddie leave the scene. Vogel and the corrupt officers are arrested instead. Everett personally supervises Michael X's arrest in Trinidad, and has Gale's remains exhumed for reburial in Britain. The final scenes have Terry and Martine saying good-bye, and Terry and his reunited family enjoying a carefree life on their small motor yacht off a sunny beach. The epilogue states that the revelations about the brothel forced many government officials to resign. Scotland Yard investigates the corrupt officers named in the ledger. It notes that Michael X was hanged in 1975 for Benson's murder and erroneously claims that his personal files are kept hidden in the British National Archives until 2054.The National Archives catalogue shows six files relating to Michael X, all of which were made public before the film was made. Unreleased files appear in the catalogue while still retricted, but there is none such relating to Michael X. Vogel is imprisoned for eight years for crimes that were unrelated to the robbery. The murderers of Guy and Bambas have never been found. About ₤4 million worth of materials and money were stolen from the robbery.

An impeccably stylish lad in his late twenties, Alfie funds his hedonistic lifestyle by working as a driver for the local limousine service. Meeting, romancing, and seducing women comes as second nature to Alfie. In addition to maintaining a casual relationship with a single mother named Julie  that he refers to as his ""semi-regular-quasi-sort-of-girlfriend thing"", he also sleeps with various girls on the side, such as the married-yet-neglected-by-her-husband blonde named Dorie  whom he regularly meets for sex after work in the back of his limo. At the first inkling Dorie may desire their liaison to grow into something more, he decides to stop all contact. Alfie ultimately views women as expendable, cutting them loose as soon as he feels they're starting to cramp his style. Alfie's best friend, Marlon , is also a limo driver in the same company. In addition to their friendship, the two are working on a plan that would eventually see them start their own business. However, for the moment, Marlon is preoccupied with trying to win back his ex-girlfriend, Lonette , who dumped him after he hesitated to commit, and is now, despite his desperate efforts, stubbornly unresponsive to his reconciliation attempts. At a loss for ideas, Marlon eventually turns to Alfie for help by having him put in a good word with Lonette. This takes place late one night following a closing shift in a bar where Lonette is waitressing. As the staff is closing up, Alfie is trying to persuade her to take Marlon back, however, the conversation soon goes in a different direction and eventually after a few drinks, they end up having passionate sex on the pool table. Alfie is so terrified about facing his friend in the event he ever gets the word of what happened, but is amazed and relieved to be told by jubilant Marlon that Lonette got back with him the very next day after her ""conversation"" with Alfie. Around the same time, as he arrives to Julie's place looking for another booty call, Alfie is informed she no longer wants to see him since she found the proof of his infidelity . He seems to take it all in stride with a smile on his face as he disappears down her street. Alfie soon gets another unpleasant piece of news, this time from Lonette: she is pregnant with his child. Without telling Marlon, the two of them visit a clinic in order for her to have an abortion. Soon afterwards, Marlon and Lonette unexpectedly move upstate without even saying goodbye to Alfie. Alfie is then faced with an erectile problem that causes him plenty of embarrassment in front of his next few female conquests. Following repeated failures to achieve an erection with various women, he visits a doctor who performs an examination and reassures him there's nothing wrong physically that would stand in his way of achieving one, thus writing his erectile problems off to ""probably stress"". However, it's not all good news as the same doctor locates a lump, indicating a possibility of testicular cancer. Alfie immediately has a test run at the clinic and spends a few anxious days awaiting the results. During one of his trips to the hospital, Alfie meets an older man named Joe  in the clinic bathroom. After a brief conversation during which he reveals he's a widower, Joe imparts some life advice to depressed Alfie: ""Find somebody to love, and live every day like it's your last"". This is followed by him offering his card to Alfie ""in case he wants someone to talk to"". Soon afterwards, luckily, Alfie finds out he doesn't have cancer. Alfie takes the whole erection episode followed by a mortal health scare to heart and decides that ""aiming higher"" in his love life will be his new resolution. To that end, he picks up a beautiful young woman named Nikki  before Christmas, and they quickly embark on a passionate but turbulent relationship against the winter holidays backdrop. Soon after moving in together, Alfie is not happy about having to endure Nikki's wild mood swings and reckless behavior that occur as a result of her decision to go off her medication. While beginning to distance himself emotionally from Nikki, he sets his sights on an older woman, Liz , a sultry cosmetics mogul whom he meets in the company of an older man while driving them around. Although Alfie is clearly quite taken with her confident flair and high society ways, she, unlike many of the women in Alfie's life, seemingly displays no intent to move their relationship past the physical stage. Unsurprisingly, his infatuation with Liz serves as the final catalyst that leads to the end of his interest in Nikki, who soon moves out of his life. Not long afterwards, a chance meeting with his ex Julie in a coffee shop renews his feelings for her. To his dismay, she's now happily involved with someone else, filling Alfie with feelings of regret over his years of thoughtless womanizing. A trip upstate to visit Marlon and his now-wife, Lonette, reveals that she never actually went through with the abortion opting instead to give birth to Alfie's child. Alfie also learns that Marlon accepted the baby and cares for it now as though it's his biological child, all of which leaves Alfie feeling horrible. Downcast and gloomy, Alfie digs up the number given to him by a man named Joe from the clinic bathroom and calls him up. Walking along the beach together, Joe imparts some words of encouragment to Alfie. He then turns to Liz for reassurance and comfort, but is crushed to discover that she has a new man in her life. Completely rattled, Alfie insists to know what her new boyfriend has that he doesn't, to which she, after some initial hesitation, simply states: ""he's younger than you"". Shocked and dismayed by one blow after another, Alfie happens to run into Dorie. She walks by the docks late one night, but at this point he is more interested in a shoulder to lean on than sex. She, however, informs him she's moved on, and, though cordial and polite, generally lets him know she wants no part of him anymore. The film ends with Alfie's monologue in which he begins to question his shallow self-indulgent lifestyle.new york city cheating flirt lover older woman seduces younger guy playboy remake",False,tt0375173,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,35060882,0,0,-0.7113089168720855,1.9257596443831189,,,-3502442.214285714,41926129.21428572,,,24701296.75,5,82701296.75,4.0,,0.0,,,3250000.0,4.0,15250000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,5350214.0,0.0,11850214.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34735524.25,46485524.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1284514.0,21284514.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,69984862.0,102984862.0,1.0,,,,52721029.5,61221029.5,2.0,,,,10900509.238095239,39314794.952380955,21.0,,,36600503.583333336,11100503.583333334,1.125,2.0,84824632.31357588

A flashback of several months shows Charles with his wife and teenage daughter. Charles's marriage is deteriorating, and his daughter suffers from diabetes, requiring expensive medication. On a commuter train, Charles encounters an alluring woman named Lucinda Harris . She is a married financial adviser. A mutual attraction develops, and the two begin meeting frequently. Ultimately, they decide to consummate their affair and wind up in a seedy hotel. An armed man&mdash; later identified as Philippe LaRoche &mdash; bursts into the hotel room, beats Charles, and brutally rapes Lucinda. Charles and Lucinda agree not to report the crime, as they do not want their spouses to learn of the affair. Shortly after, Charles is blackmailed by LaRoche, who threatens to kill his family if he doesn't pay 20,000, which Charles promptly pays. A month later, the attacker calls again, this time demanding 100,000. Charles tells Winston Boyko , an ex-con, about LaRoche and asks for advice. Winston offers to scare LaRoche away in return for 10%  of LaRoche's demand. Charles embezzles the 10,000 from his employer. However, LaRoche shoots Winston dead. Charles is questioned by detective Franklin Church  about Winston's murder. Later, he receives a call from LaRoche: He has Lucinda at gunpoint, and will kill her if Charles doesn't bring the 100,000 immediately. Charles takes the money from an account meant specifically for his daughter's medical treatment; the payoff complete, he and Lucinda say a tortured goodbye. When he stops by Lucinda's office and asks for her, he is shown a woman who is the actual Lucinda Harris. The woman he met on the train is really Jane, a temporary employee, who was impersonating Lucinda. Charles realizes Jane was in on the scam. He tracks her down and sees her kissing LaRoche. Determined to retrieve his stolen 100,000, he follows Jane's moves and sees that she has suckered another unsuspecting businessman. He returns to the hotel where Jane, LaRoche, and their partner Dexter  are setting up their new mark. Jane and the businessman go inside the room; Charles waits for LaRoche to approach, and knocks him unconscious before he enters. He breaks in and demands the return of his money. A gunfight ensues and everyone gets shot but Charles. After the melee, Charles watches the false Lucinda die and leaves with his briefcase, which still contains his money. Charles is arrested for embezzling the 10,000 that he paid Winston and is sentenced to six months of community service teaching. During one of his classes, he comes across the story about him that was being written at the beginning of the film. The unknown writer instructs him to go to the laundry room—there, he finds LaRoche, who survived the gunfight. LaRoche threatens to continue interfering with his life but Charles stabs him to death. As he leaves, he encounters Detective Church. Though suspicious of Charles, he lets him return home to his wife and daughter.prison chicago, usa rape based on novel or book hotel room husband wife relationship anonymous letter blackmail family's daily life letter business man relationship problems man between two women revenge deception beating flashback violence wallet extramarital affair embezzlement advertising executive abortion commuter train",False,tt0398017,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,57479076,1,0,1.6126852727272727,-2.6760407675788414,-4012679.0,55987321.0,75789804.94444445,101634557.05555555,,,75760950.5,4,145660950.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,12232661.5,66232661.5,2.0,24255868.166666668,70422534.83333333,6.0,,,,,,,,,,-10730514.0,119269486.0,1.0,,,,57466670.0,82466670.0,1.0,-4252606.571428572,20890250.57142857,7.0,65802170.7,96452170.7,10.0,-4012679.0,55987321.0,1.0,,,,-6439124.0,7060876.0,1.0,,,,,,,50803716.0,113303716.0,2.0,,,,,,,44504693.0,49771029.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,29112941.25,37612941.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,145660950.5,75760950.5,0.5,2.0,109858494.28372188

Back in the attic of his house in London, Frank solves the puzzle box, prompting hooked chains to emerge from it and tear deep into his flesh. Black robed, horribly mutilated humanoids appear and attack Frank with hooked chains, tearing him into pieces. Their leader Pinhead , picks up the box and twists it back into its original state, taking Frank's dissected physical remnants back to their realm with them and restoring the room to normal. Sometime later, Frank's brother Larry ([[Andrew Robinson  arrives at the house along with his second wife, Julia , who previously had an affair with Frank. The pair know Frank as an avowed hedonist and petty criminal, and, presuming that he is in jail in some exotic location, decide to move in. Larry's teenage daughter, Kirsty Cotton , chooses not to live with her stepmother and moves into her own place. While moving into the house, Larry cuts his hand on a nail, and drips blood on the attic floor. The blood somehow reaches Frank in his prison in the humanoids' realm, partially restoring his body and allowing him to escape to the attic. That night, Julia finds Frank (now portrayed by [[Oliver Smith  in the attic; still obsessed with him after their affair, she agrees to harvest blood for him so that he can fully restore his body and they can run away together. The next day, Julia begins picking up men in bars and bringing them back to the house, where she murders them with a hammer; Frank then consumes their blood and internal organs, progressively regenerating his own body. Once he has regained enough strength, Frank explains to Julia that he had exhausted all sensory experiences and sought out the puzzle box on the promise that it would open a portal to a realm of new carnal pleasures. Instead, it opened up a portal to the realm of the ""Cenobites,"" who have since taken Frank as their prisoner and subjected him to extreme, sadomasochistic torture. Meanwhile, Kirsty spies Julia bringing men to the house and, believing her to be having an affair, follows her to the attic one afternoon, where she interrupts a murder. Frank attacks her, but panics when Kirsty grabs the puzzle box. Kirsty throws the box out the window, creating enough of a distraction for her to escape. Outside the house, she retrieves the puzzle box and runs away, but collapses from exhaustion shortly thereafter. After being taken to the hospital, Kirsty solves the puzzle box, summoning the Cenobites. Their leader explains that while the Cenobites have been perceived as angels and demons, they are simply ""explorers"" of carnal experience, practicing a form of sadomasochism so extreme that it transcends the boundary between pain and pleasure. Although they initially attempt to force Kirsty to return with them to their realm, the Leader becomes indignant at the suggestion one of their ""subjects"" has escaped, and agrees to consider freeing Kirsty in exchange for taking them to Frank. Kirsty returns home, where Larry tells her that he has confronted and killed Frank. Julia shows her a flayed corpse in the attic, and shortly after the Cenobites show up. Kirsty attempts to escape with Larry, but his language and mannerisms ultimately lead Kirsty to realize that Frank (now portrayed by [[Andrew Robinson  has in fact killed her father, and is wearing his skin. Frank pursues Kirsty through the house with a knife, inadvertently killing Julia in the process. He eventually corners Kirsty in the attic, where he brags about having killed his brother. The admission summons up the Cenobites, who ensnare him with chains and tear him to pieces. They then attempt to renege on their deal with Kirsty and take her back to their realm. Kirsty's boyfriend, Steve, arrives and looks for Kirsty. Kirsty defeats the Cenobites by reversing the motions needed to open the puzzle box, sending them back to their realm. Kirsty and Steve leave the house together. Afterwards, Kirsty tries to burn the box in a garbage dump. A vagrant enters the flames and retrieves the box before transforming into a winged creature and flying away. The box ends back in the hands of the merchant who sold it to Frank, asking another prospective customer, ""What's your pleasure, sir?"".underworld seduction supernatural revenge undead human sacrifice demon puzzle box cult film attic cenobite body horror",False,tt0093177,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,14564027,0,0,13.564027,2.4643612765605467,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,65482750.456980206

Cecily is enamoured of him and his name, but upon Jack's return home and Gwendolen's unexpected arrival it becomes clear there are both too many and too few Ernests.new love country estate country house false identity beguilement relatives victorian england pleasure",False,tt0278500,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,8378141,0,0,-0.7903733059636977,0.06660377319308829,,,,,,,4535191.0,3,18535191.0,1.0,180723697.0,13.0,200973697.0,4.0,,0.0,,,116045152.33333333,13.0,138461819.0,6.0,156590912.25,7.0,170840912.25,4.0,,0.0,,,4516978.5,42.0,6341978.5,2.0,38866270.2,25.0,60866270.2,5.0,,,,-9773208.0,226792.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,4535191.0,18535191.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,75000000.0,100000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4535191.0,18535191.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15943797.333333334,23443797.333333332,3.0,,,,,,,,,99336644.65833333,83546366.88055556,12.875,3.6666666666666665,95886927.05495417

Lord Marke of Cornwall  plans to unify the peoples of Britain – Celts, Angles, Saxons and Jutes – under himself as high king to resist Irish domination. Most lords agree to this, as Marke is highly regarded and respected as a fair and courageous leader. The Irish king Donnchadh  discovers this and sends troops to attack a Jutish castle where a treaty between the British tribes is being discussed. The raid claims the lives of the castle's lord and his wife, and Marke saves their son Tristan at the cost of losing a hand. Feeling compassion for the young boy whose father loyally supported him, Marke welcomes Tristan  into his home and regards him as a son. Tristan grows to be a fierce, courageous warrior whose loyalty to Marke is not that of a knight to his lord, but rather a son to his father. Tristan and other Cornish warriors launch an attack on an Irish slave caravan: in the battle, he finds himself fighting Morholt, Donnchadh's champion and leader of his army, to whom Princess Isolde  has been promised in marriage. Though he kills Morholt and Donnchadh's forces are overrun, Tristan is severely wounded in the fight and believed dead, though he is in fact only suffering the effects of Morholt's poisoned sword. Tristan's body is put out to sea on a funeral boat which eventually washes up along the shores of Ireland. He is discovered by Isolde and her maid Bragnae, who administer an antidote that revives him and then secretly nurse him back to health. Tristan and Isolde fall in love; however, Isolde does not disclose her real name. After some time Tristan is forced to flee to Cornwall. He returns home to a hero's welcome, where a confused but overjoyed Marke welcomes him back with open arms. Plotting to defeat Britain, Donnchadh proposes a peace treaty, promising his daughter Isolde in marriage to the winner of a tournament. Tristan participates on behalf of King Marke, unaware that ""the prize"" is the woman he fell in love with in Ireland. He wins the tournament, only to discover the truth about Isolde and to see her betrothed to Marke. Although Marke is kind to Isolde, and she grows fond of him, her heart still belongs to Tristan. Tristan, in turn, is torn between his love for Isolde and his loyalty to Marke, a man whom he has loved as a father and who saved his life as a child. The couple eventually renew their love and begin an affair behind Marke's back, although they often consider ending it for the sake of their duty to Marke. This affair is discovered by Lord Wictred , a longstanding dissenter to Marke's leadership. He conspires with Donnchadh to use their love to overthrow Marke, with Wictred getting Marke's throne in exchange. In Tristan's final attempt to end the relationship, he and Isolde are caught in an awkward situation by all of the British kings. Seeing this as weakness on Marke's part, the kings decide to part ways with Marke; the alliances are ruined and his wife and son-figure have betrayed him. Marke is at first hurt and furious over their betrayal, but relents after hearing Isolde explain her history with Tristan and offers them the chance to run away together. But Tristan  chooses instead to stay in England and fight for his king. At the same time, Marke's nephew and Tristan's old friend Melot , angry and resentful of his uncle's long favouring of Tristan and tricked by Wictred's seeming support of him, shows Wictred an old passage into the Roman foundations of Marke's castle that Tristan and Isolde used to carry out their affair. Wictred then fatally stabs Melot and sneaks his army into the castle. Marke and his forces swiftly become pinned down by Donnchadh's army outside the castle and Wictred's men within. Tristan sneaks back into the castle via the secret tunnel. On the way, he finds the dying Melot: the old friends forgive one another before he dies. Tristan emerges from the tunnel and attacks Wictred's men, allowing Marke's soldiers to secure the castle, but he is mortally wounded in combat by Wictred, though he kills Wictred shortly afterwards. Now outnumbered, Tristan, Marke and the soldiers loyal to him emerge from the castle and present Wictred's severed head to Donnchadh. Marke urges the British kings standing with the Irish to aid them in making Britain a single, free nation: inspired by his words, the British kings and their men attack Donnchadh and his army. As a fierce battle between the British and Irish erupts, Marke carries a dying Tristan to the river, where they are met by Isolde. Marke leaves to lead the British to victory, while Tristan eventually dies in Isolde's arms after uttering his last words of ""You were right. I don't know if life is greater than death. But love was more than either."" Isolde sees to his burial beneath the ashes of the Roman villa where they had met to be with each other, and plants two willows by the grave, which grow intertwined; she then disappears from history and is never seen again. Marke, it is said, defeated the Irish, united Britain, then ruled in peace until the end of his days.in love with enemy castle lovers hostility revenge murder knight battle middle ages 6th century",True,tt0375154,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,28000000,0,0,-0.10714285714285714,-3.847336948521819,,,58880192.0,106380192.0,-47554172.5,12445827.5,,0,,,73708457.0,3.0,95708457.0,1.0,-10870330.0,10.0,7129670.0,1.0,,0.0,,,31931658.0,10.0,37831658.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,101183863.0,171183863.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,51655791.0,106655791.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,101183863.0,171183863.0,1.0,354640427.0,457640427.0,1.0,,,,,,,14519976.0,32269976.0,2.0,,,,6651794.0,80651794.0,2.0,,,,77719885.0,82719885.0,1.0,,,,,,,-3148455.0,851545.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,46889928.333333336,31589928.333333332,2.875,1.0,92887866.92008553

Among the competitors are Kasumi , a shinobi ninja-princess looking for her brother Hayate  , Tina , a professional wrestler setting out to prove she has more potential (complicated by her father Bass , Christie , a master thief and assassin, her treacherous partner Maximillian ‘Max’ Marsh , and Hayabusa , a friend of Kasumi and Hayate who follows Kasumi to keep her safe, using the invitation to DOA for this. A final competitor is Helena Douglas , daughter of the tournament’s late founder. When they arrive, they are monitored by the island’s supervisor, Dr. Victor Donovan , who, aided by egghead Weatherby ([[Steve Howey , is gathering data  from the fights for some mysterious project. To add to the situation, an assassin from Kasumi’s colony named Ayane , has followed Kasumi to kill her and wipe away the disgrace the princess has caused to the clan. The contest plays out, with multiple contestants fighting and being defeated (including Gen Fu , Bayman , Leon  and Zack , until only Kasumi, Christie, Hayabusa and Tina are left, with Helena being defeated by Christie. During the course of the film, Max and Christie form a plan to steal over 100,000,000 stowed away inside a hidden vault. During her fight, Christie sees that the key to finding and unlocking the vault is a tattoo on the back of Helena’s neck. Meanwhile, Kasumi begins to suspect Donovan of lying about her brother being killed in the previous tournament, and Hayabusa, infiltrating the main facility to find the truth, is captured. She is more than once confronted and nearly killed by Ayane, who Kasumi tries to convince that Hayate is alive . Also, Weatherby begins to fall for Helena, and in the end tells her about what he knows of the mystery project, and that before Helena’s father could shut the project down, he died . On the final day of the tournament, wondering where Hayabusa is, Kasumi, Christie and Tina look for him and discover a secret entrance to the main complex, where they find Hayabusa unconscious. They are then gassed and captured. Meanwhile, Helena resolves to stop the mystery project, and has to fight the armed staff of the island, sent to kill her and Weatherby by Donovan. They are followed inside by Max, who finds his way to the vault, and is then knocked out by Bayman, who is working for Donovan. Inside the main complex, Donovan shows the four semifinalists the project he has been developing; an advanced form of neural interface that allows him and others to use the fighters' combined skills to become the ultimate fighter. After ‘downloading’ the data into the device , he then shows that he kept Hayate alive and in peak condition to test the technology. He challenges Hayate to fight and win, if the others are to survive. Hayate accepts and is defeated, then thrown through a wall to die. Hayate is saved by Ayane, and the two of them apparently accept each other. With the successful demo, Donovan prepares to sell the technology around the world, and begins downloading it to the watching buyers. Weatherby stops the broadcast and alerts the CIA, which provokes Donovan to head for them. Helena keeps Donovan back while Weatherby frees the others, but both are defeated and Donovan activates a self-destruct sequence which will obliterate the base. Kasumi, Helena, Christie, Tina, Ayane and Hayate launch a combined attack on Donovan, while Hayabusa and Weatherby find Max and escape with him, despite Max's urge to go back for the money. During the battle with the fighters, Donovan’s ‘glasses’ are knocked off and he is easily paralyzed by Hayate and Kasumi. The fighters then all escape as the base explodes and Donovan is consumed by the flames, making their escape by a hijacked pirates' boat. The film ends with Helena, Ayane, Christie, Tina and Kasumi preparing to fight an army of ninja in Kasumi’s palace .competition martial arts kung fu assassin fight island karate nerd wrestling bikini ninja tournament explosion violence based on video game swimsuit",False,tt0398913,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,480314,0,0,-42.721398918207676,-3.847336948521819,-12143288.0,2856712.0,45947322.333333336,100280655.66666667,84394835.0,129394835.0,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,37000000.0,10.0,42000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,77189848.5,116189848.5,2.0,,,,37496740.0,64996740.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42000000.0,37000000.0,1.25,1.0,92887866.92008553

While visiting a kibbutz, she sees the local schoolteacher, Rachel Rosenthal , and they realise they knew each other during World War II. As Rachel recalls the past near a riverbank, the film then flashes back to 1944, and begins the story of Rachel Stein, a Dutch Jewish singer who had lived in Berlin before the war and is now hiding from the Nazi regime in the occupied Netherlands.  When the farmhouse where she had been hiding is accidentally destroyed by an American bomber, Rachel manages to escape thanks to a local boy, Rob, and visits a lawyer named Smaal , who provides her with some of her father's money so that she can flee, helped by a member of the Resistance named Van Gein . Rachel and Rob are reunited with her family and try to flee by boat through the Biesbosch with them and other Jews from the Nazi-occupied part of the Netherlands to the liberated southern part of the country. However, it turns out to be a trap. They are ambushed on the river by members of the German SS, who kill them and rob the bodies of their cash and other valuables. Rachel alone survives, but she does not manage to escape from occupied territory. Using a non-Jewish alias, Ellis de Vries, Rachel becomes involved with a Resistance group in the Hague, under the leadership of Gerben Kuipers  and working closely with a doctor in the Resistance, Hans Akkermans . Smaal is in touch with this Resistance cell. When Kuipers' son and other members of the Resistance are captured, Ellis agrees to help by seducing local SD commander Hauptsturmführer Ludwig Müntze , bleaching her hair blonde. Müntze invites her to a party at the local SD headquarters, and there, Ellis recognises Obersturmführer Günther Franken , Müntze's brutal deputy, as the SS officer who oversaw the massacre of her refugee party. She obtains a job as a secretary at the SD headquarters while also falling in love with Müntze, who, in contrast to Franken, is not abusive or sadistic. He works out that her hair is bleached and she is a Jew, but does not care. She also becomes friends with her Dutch colleague Ronnie, who collaborates with the Germans, working for them, being sexually available to them , and accepting stolen gifts from them. Thanks to a bug Ellis manages to plant in Franken's office, the Resistance works out that it was Van Gein who betrayed Rachel, her family and the other Jews to the SS in return for a cut of the profits. Going against Kuipers' orders, Akkermans and others decide to abduct Van Gein to expose the suspected traitor. The plot goes wrong when Akkermans' chloroform fails to work, Van Gein fights back and is killed. Franken responds by planning to kill forty hostages, including most of the plotters, but Müntze, who realises the war is lost and has been negotiating with the Resistance, cancels the order. Müntze confronts Ellis as being a member of the Resistance. He demands that she tell him her story, which she does. On this evidence he confronts Franken with a superior and Franken is ordered to open his safe, in a search for the money, gold and jewels stolen from the Jews he had killed. Murdering Jews was not against SS regulations, but personally stealing their wealth was a capital offense. When opened by the commanding officer, Obergruppenführer Käutner , however, the safe reveals nothing. Realizing that Müntze is now a danger to him, the apparently angry and embarrassed Franken reveals to Käutner that Müntze has been negotiating with Dutch resistance ""terrorists"" for a truce. Müntze is condemned to death and imprisoned, along with the members of the resistance cell Franken was already planning to shoot as a reprisal for the killing of Van Gein. Ellis agrees to participate in a rescue attempt for the resistance prisoners only on the condition that they free Müntze too and, albeit reluctantly, the others agree. The plan has been betrayed by an unknown insider, and the would-be rescuers find the prisoners' cells to be filled with German troops. Only Akkermans and another resister survive the ""rescue"". Ellis is subsequently arrested by Franken and taken to his office, the one she bugged. Franken has known about her and the bug all the time. Knowing that the resistance is listening in, he stages a confrontation to make the resistance group believe Ellis is the Nazi collaborator, responsible for the catastrophic failure of the rescue operation. Hearing this, Kuipers and his companions swear to hunt her down and make her pay for her treason. Ronnie, having learned of Ellis's role with the Resistance, helps Ellis and Müntze escape. When the country is liberated by the Allies, Franken attempts to escape by boat, but is killed by Akkermans. Ronnie, instead of being imprisoned or publicly shamed as a collaborator, latches on to a Canadian captain whom she subsequently marries. Suspecting Smaal is the traitor, Müntze and Ellis return to confront him. Smaal, who has asked the Canadians for protection as refugee, denies the accusations. He shows them the titular black book in which he had detailed all his dealings with the Jews he helped. He and his wife have a theory about who the insider is and agrees to tell it to Ellis only if she goes with them. However, both are murdered before they can escape. Not getting a good look at the killer, Müntze chases him into the street, only to be recognized by the triumphant Dutch and arrested by the Canadians. The Dutch also recognize Ellis and arrest her as a ""collaborator"", but not before she grabs the black book. Müntze is brought before the ranking Canadian forces only to find that they have enlisted the assistance of Käutner in keeping order among the defeated German forces. Käutner convinces a Canadian colonel that under military law the defeated German military retains the right to punish its own soldiers. He then finds the death warrant he previously issued against Müntze for his negotiations with Ellis's resistance cell. Although initially opposing the idea of murdering a witness, the Canadian colonel finally agrees, and Müntze is immediately executed by a firing squad of German troops. Ellis is imprisoned with other accused collaborators, humiliated and tortured by the violently anti-Nazi volunteer jailers, but is rescued by Akkermans, now a colonel in the Dutch Army, who calls the jailers no better than the Nazis. Bringing her to his medical office, Akkermans tells Ellis that he killed Franken when the Nazi tried to escape, and shows her the cash and jewels stolen from Franken's Jewish victims. When informed about Müntze's fate, Ellis goes in shock, and is administered a tranquilizer by Akkermans. Feeling dizzy, Ellis grasps that Akkermans is trying to kill her with an overdose of insulin, and realizes that he had been the traitor with Franken, and the one murderer of the Smaals. While Akkermans is distracted playing hero to a crowd that heralds him, she survives by quickly eating a bar of chocolate to counteract the insulin and, staggering, jumps from Akkermans' balcony into the crowd below and runs away. He tries to follow her, but is blocked by the very same people cheering him as the hero of the Resistance. Ellis proves her innocence to the British intelligence and to the former Resistance leader Gerben Kuipers by means of Smaal's black book, which lists how many Jews  were secretly taken to Akkermans for medical help just prior to their murders. Together, Ellis and Kuipers intercept the fleeing Akkermans, who is hiding in a coffin in a hearse, filled with the stolen money, gold and jewels. They quickly dispatch the accomplice driver, and while Kuipers drives, Ellis screws down the coffin's secret air vents using the locket with the pictures of her murdered family. They drive to Hollands Diep where the SS trap had been sprung, and wait until Akkermans suffocates. Ellis and Kruipers are left wondering what to do with the stolen money and jewels. The scene changes to Israel in 1956, as Rachel meets her husband and their two children at the end of the day, walking back into Kibbutz Stein, which a sign at the gate announces was funded with the recovered money stolen from Jews killed during the war.

When the regimental Colonel  announces that the regiment is being dispatched to Egyptian-ruled Sudan to rescue the British General Charles ""Chinese"" Gordon , young Faversham becomes nervous and resigns his commission. Shocked by his son's actions, Harry's father  disowns him. Perceiving his resignation as cowardice, his friends and fiancée give him four white feathers, the symbol of cowardice. Tormented, isolated and alone in London, Harry learns that his best friend Jack  and his former regiment have come under brutal attack by rebels. Undertaking the perilous journey into the Sudan alone, he strikes up an alliance with Abou Fatma , a wise mercenary warrior. Harry then disguises himself as an Arab. Harry and Abou Fatma follow a group of army workers he believes to be Mahdi spies, following them takes them to the garrison of Abu-Klea , which they realize on entry has been overrun. However, before they can leave the gates are closed. Harry is taken roughly aside, as this happens he begs Abou Fatma to warn his friends that their destination is under siege and an attack is likely. Instead of being discovered Harry is given a red British military jacket. Meanwhile the regiment has stopped its march to bury a group of British dead killed by the Mahdi. Abou Fatma is captured by Egyptian soldiers; believing he is an enemy scout they bring him before the British officers . He tells the British that he has been sent by a British officer, referring to Faversham, in order to warn them of the Mahdi's attack. He also points out that Muslims always bury their dead and that of the enemy, but that these bodies have been left to keep the British occupied. Faversham's comrades are worried, but ultimately Abou Fatma's warnings are disregarded, and he is whipped. Because of their disregard of the warnings, the British and Egyptian troops are not prepared for battle. The Mahdi rebels attack with spearmen, riflemen and cavalry, while the British forces form a square. Firing volley after volley, the British repel the initial Mahdi assault just as they spot British cavalry reinforcements in their distinctive red uniforms. A force of skirmishers is sent to pursue the retreating Sudanese, but they are ambushed by Mahdi rebels hiding beneath the sand, and the skirmishers are forced to fight on foot. Soon the British discover that the cavalry they perceived were their own reinforcements are actually Sudanese disguised in British uniforms. Among them is Faversham, who was mistakenly thought to be a Sudanese. The British square hastily reorganises and fires a few volleys, in the process killing several skirmishers who have not yet returned to the square (including Harry's friend Edward Castleton . In the end the order is given for retreat. Jack was found and protected by Harry during the battle. Jack's rifle had misfired and blinded him. Harry finds letters of tenderness from Ethne but puts aside his feelings and cares for Jack without telling him who he is. Not knowing who his rescuer was, Jack then returns home. He asks Ethne to marry him, but she does not give him an answer discussing the matter with Harry's father. Tom tells Jack that Harry had come to visit him in the Sudan to tell him he had been the officer that sent Abou, and that Harry had expressed bitter anger and sorrow that his friends did not listen to the warning. Harry asked for money and explained that he believes William lives on in the notorious Mahdi prison of Omdurman, and Harry is determined to find him and rescue him. Abou advises him not to go, but Harry goes anyway. Later Abou rescues Harry and his miraculously still alive comrade by giving them 'poison' that really just fakes the symptoms of death. However, a guard is suspicious of the duo's death and follows them along with three other guards. All four guards are killed by Harry and Abou and then the two part ways: Abou back to the desert and Harry back to England. Harry is acknowledged by his father and Ethne asks for her feather back; however she is now engaged to Jack. Jack comes to find out Harry rescued him as Jack touches his face as he did in the desert and releases Ethne from their engagement. After a ceremony of Remembrance, Harry and Ethne hold hands and are engaged once more.islam sex loyalty bravery british empire army revenge honor murder escape soldier battle church violence britain slave colonialism military imperialism",False,tt0240510,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,29882645,0,0,-0.1712483951805471,0.06660377319308829,,,-7938092.0,32961908.0,73931049.6923077,95177629.53846154,,0,,,-11624365.0,2.0,1375635.0,1.0,,0.0,,,354640427.0,2.0,457640427.0,1.0,,0.0,,,80479.0,1.0,5580479.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,45848166.0,75598166.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,64765282.5,70015282.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,154865513.66666666,114365513.66666667,0.625,1.0,95886927.05495417

He is replaced by the ""squeaky clean"" Sheldon Mopes  and his character, Smoochy the Rhino. Mopes is uniquely sincere and thoroughly interested in providing quality child edutainment but is seen by the network as nothing but a substitute for Randolph and they immediately implement a full line of theme-related products based on Smoochy in order to reap the tremendous commercial benefits of what has quickly become a tremendously popular kids show. Randolph finds himself unemployed, homeless, and outcast from the television industry by his two-faced associate Marion Stokes . In an effort to return to the spotlight, Randolph hatches several schemes to bring down Mopes in hopes of reclaiming his time slot, including planting phallic-shaped cookies into a live taping of the Smoochy show. Mopes quickly finds himself losing creative control over his show to his hardened producer Nora Wells . With the help of his new agent Burke Bennett , Mopes renegotiates his contract and is named executive producer. He is approached by Irish mob boss Tommy Cotter , who wants Mopes to create a spot on his show for her cousin Spinner , a former boxer whose numerous head injuries have left him with severe brain damage. Sheldon reluctantly adds Spinner to the show, first as a cowbell-wielding game warden, and later on as Smoochy's cousin Moochy. Rainbow Randolph sets a scheme to destroy Mopes's career and regain his show too. but both fail. Mopes becomes enraged to learn that Burke signed him up to star in a Smoochy ice show; he feels that the event will exploit children. Burke and Merv Green , the heads of the corrupt charity running the ice show, unsuccessfully warn Mopes from backing out of the event. Soon afterward, a disguised Randolph dupes Mopes into doing a Smoochy act at a neo-Nazi rally that is raided by the police. Smoochy is labeled a racist and fired. However, when Randolph accidentally lets it slip to Nora that he framed Smoochy, he is arrested. Smoochy's reputation and show are restored. After telling him that his show is back on the air, Nora kisses Mopes and has sex with him, starting a relationship. Smoochy commits to the ice show. He decides that all proceeds will go to the drug rehab clinic he used to work at, which was closed due to lack of funding; the kids will be given free souvenirs and healthful snacks. Burke and Green retaliate by plotting to kill Mopes and hire a new host who will cooperate with their profit skimming. However, Green and his men accidentally kill Spinner in his Moochy costume; they are discovered and killed by Cotter. Meanwhile, Randolph corners Mopes and Nora in their penthouse and threatens to kill them. They talk him down and discover that he's depressed and genuinely misses entertaining children. An empathetic Mopes offers to let Randolph stay in the penthouse until he recovers. Burke and Stokes hire heroin addict Buggy Ding Dong , another former host, to assassinate Mopes during his ice show. Buggy steals a backstage pass to get inside. However, Randolph, who has been summoned to the ice show, tackles Buggy just as he tries to shoot Mopes from the rafters. Randolph and Buggy struggle for the sniper rifle, until Buggy falls to his death. After Mopes realizes that Burke and Stokes set him up, he chases after Burke into an alley. He pulls a gun and threatens to kill Burke, but Cotter and her men arrive and persuade him to stop. The movie ends with Smoochy and Rainbow Randolph launching a new show together.corruption moderator success irish mob duringcreditsstinger",False,tt0266452,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,8374062,0,0,-4.970817985345702,0.06660377319308829,,,16128397.333333334,21495064.0,,,,0,,,-4227303.5,6.0,1272696.5,2.0,,0.0,,,200000000.0,10.0,280000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20552391.6,39952391.6,5.0,,,,,,,10244207.0,22244207.0,1.0,,,,113207122.0,238207122.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,183245422.0,284912088.6666667,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,140636348.25,97886348.25,2.0,1.5,95886927.05495417

Ali and Da West Staines Massiv are heartbroken to learn that their beloved local leisure centre  will be demolished by the local council. Ali and his friends decide to protest this injustice. After he goes on a hunger strike and is spotted chained to some railings by the nefarious Chancellor of the Exchequer/Deputy Prime Minister David Carlton , he is drawn into a world of seedy political intrigue, as the Deputy Prime Minister tries to use Ali as a tool to destroy the Prime Minister's credibility. Ali is put forward as a candidate to be the next MP for Staines in a crucial by-election and manages to alienate most who cross his path, including feminists and the elderly. During a debate with his rival candidate, Ali tries to insult his rival by claiming that he ""sucked off a horse"". Unknown to Ali and the public, it turns out that the rival did indeed do such a thing, and trying to explain it away, he claims when he was out hunting with a friend he slipped, and his mouth landed on a horse's penis, which due to the mating season was erect. Ali then wins. Although originally seeming out of his depth as a Member of Parliament, Ali's bizarre behaviour and solutions seem to actually work. He visits a Customs checkpoint in Dover, as a delegate compiling a report . Through ideas such as making more ""relatable"" education and selectively ensuring the immigration of attractive  women into the UK, Ali becomes incredibly popular, meeting the Prime Minister's intentions and bringing his percentage lead in the polls up twenty two percent. With this the Prime Minister offers to save Ali's leisure centre. First though, Ali accompanies the Prime Minister to a United Nations peace conference to avert war between the French-speaking African nations of Chad and Burkina Faso. The United States and Russia back opposite countries and both threaten nuclear attacks. It gets to the point where World War III is almost declared when Ali sneaks into the catering area and puts an entire bag of marijuana, which he had stolen from Customs earlier, into the delegates' tea and orders that they be served it right away. He throws the empty bag into a nearby rubbish bin. A side-effect is that the two opposing African presidents become allies . The Prime Minister says that Ali has saved the world. However, Carlton's secretary Kate Hedges figures out what Ali has done and retrieves the empty marijuana bag , which she mails to the press. Upon his return to the UK, Ali is forced to leave parliament. Before the Leisure Centre can be saved, a video emerges of Ali and his girlfriend having sex in the Prime Minister's bedroom at Chequers. As Ali was wearing items of the Prime Minister's clothing at the time, the media believe the video details the Prime Minister with a prostitute, forcing his resignation. This results in Deputy Prime Minister David Carlton being made Prime Minister. Carlton, who despises Ali, orders the destruction of the aforementioned leisure centre. He has also bought all available real estate in Staines in the knowledge that the town is to be destroyed to make way for a new terminal for Heathrow Airport, which will make him super wealthy. After turning down an offer to have sex with Kate Hedges, in exchange for ""keeping his mouth shut"" about the videotape, Ali and the West Staines Massiv must race against time to find the master copy of the CCTV tape proving the former Prime Minister's innocence, extending the olive branch to all the gangs all over Staines and neighbouring Berkshire  to help them break into the vaults and retrieve the said tape. They do this successfully and manage to reinstate the original Prime Minister, save the Leisure Centre, and all live happily ever after when Ali is posted as the British ambassador to Jamaica. Staines is saved from destruction, with the reinstated Prime Minister declaring that Slough is to be destroyed instead.

When starving peasants in Paris start rioting for food, he responds by ordering his chief adviser Pierre, to send them rotten food - although he later orders Pierre executed for this and all rioters shot dead. Meanwhile, the king wallows in hedonistic luxury and seduces a parade of women. The legendary Three Musketeers have retired from their posts: Aramis is now a priest of the Jesuits; Porthos is a frequent visitor to Parisian brothels; Athos has a son named Raoul who has just returned from the war and signifies his application to join the musketeers, like his father who once served with pride and honor. Meanwhile, Athos gives Raoul his wife's ring, saying that the only lady worthy to wear it is the one that Raoul loves. The lucky girl he loves is Christine Bellefort whom he intends to propose for marriage. At a festival, the two lovers are greeted by an older D'Artagnan, who is still in the service of the King as Captain of the Musketeers, striving to retain the esprit de corps of the old days. D'Artagnan wishes Raoul and Christine luck, but just before Raoul can propose, the king's eyes fall on Christine. He arranges for Raoul to be returned to combat, where he is killed by the Dutch cannons while leading ground troops in an attack en-masse. The news of his son's death reaches Athos, who, in a fit of rage, proceeds to the king's palace to seek vengeance. He injures two musketeers before D'Artagnan overpowers him on the Palace grounds. This puts a severe strain on Athos's friendship with D'Artagnan, who he now sees as a traitor for siding with his son's killer. In the wake of Raoul's death, Louis invites Christine to the palace where she sleeps with him, grateful for the medical assistance his doctors have given to her mother and sister. When Louis orders the death of the secret leader of the Jesuit order, Aramis sets in motion a plot to overthrow the king with the help of his old comrades for the secret leader is none other than him. Only Athos and Porthos agree to the plan; D'Artagnan refuses to betray his oath of honor and allegiance to the king. The three former Musketeers sneak into an island prison and arrange the escape of a mysterious prisoner: a man in an iron mask. They replace him with a corpse in a matching iron mask and, pretending it is plague ridden, burn it so the guards will not know the face behind the iron mask. They take the young man to a safe house in the countryside and unmask him: he is Philippe, the identical twin of King Louis. While he is identical to his brother, Philippe is compassionate and gentle. Aramis reveals that Philippe was sent away by his father, King Louis XIII, to save France from dynastic warfare. Later, when Louis discovered Philippe's existence, he was too superstitious to have his own brother murdered; so instead, he devised a way to keep him hidden: the iron mask. Aramis, at time still serving as a musketeer and clad in black uniform, the only thing Philippe remembers, was the one who took him away to prison, an act which has haunted him ever since. Meanwhile, King Louis succeeds in seducing Christine completely, claiming that he ordered Raoul to be placed far from the battlefront. Christine receives a letter from Raoul, predicting his death and saying that he forgives her for becoming the king's mistress. Whilst in bed with Louis, Christine admits that she still loves Raoul and that she is not in love with him. Enraged, Louis forsakes Christine. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis teach Philippe how to act like royalty, so he may replace Louis as king. Together they abduct Louis during a fancy dancing ball. Before his absence is revealed, Philippe takes his place. However, Philippe's good nature gives him away when he helps one of the dancing ladies up from the floor after she falls over and spares Christine's life when she storms in and openly accuses him of murdering Raoul , promising to make amends for wronging her. D'Artagnan realizes something is amiss, orders all palace musketeers to be on full alert, and personally escorts Philippe outside. They arrive at the docks just as Athos, Porthos, and Aramis are about to sail for the Bastille with Louis. The men collectively decide to make a trade for the brothers' lives; however, Philippe is re-captured in the ensuing chaos of their escape. Afterwards, D'Artagnan is stunned to learn that Philippe is Louis' brother and pleads with Louis to spare his life. Louis at first refuses, but Philippe bluffs that he is more terrified of the iron mask than death itself, begging to be executed rather than sent back to prison. Louis orders him placed in the Bastille and once again in the mask. In the aftermath, Christine is found to have hanged herself from her bedroom window. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis brush off their old Musketeer uniforms and, with D'Artagnan's help, break into the Bastille prison and escape with Philippe. Louis, however, has prepared an ambush. Fortunately, the narrowness of the corridor and the guards' respect for D'Artagnan, their captain, prevents them from overwhelming the four Musketeers with their numbers, although the five men eventually end up trapped against a barred door at the end of the corridor with no way out. Determined to save his friends, Philippe offers to give himself up in exchange for their lives. D'Artagnan refuses, revealing to everyone's astonishment, that he is actually the twins' father, having had an affair with Queen Anne, and that it was out of fatherly devotion that he served Louis, not loyalty. D'Artangan adds that he feels the pride as a father only for the first time upon learning that Philippe is also his son. The four Musketeers and Philippe make a final charge at Louis's front line. Their ""magnificent valour"" stuns the soldiers into immobility, angering Louis and forcing to him repeatedly shout orders to fire. He lays his hands on one of the soldiers' muskets and it goes off, setting off the rest, with many of the men shutting their eyes or looking away out of reluctance. The smoke clears to reveal the five men still standing; all the shots, barring a few flesh wounds, missed. An enraged Louis lunges toward Philippe and tries to stab him. D'Artagnan jumps between them and is fatally wounded. Philippe knocks Louis down and begins to strangle him, but D'Artagnan, with his dying breaths, reminds Philippe that Louis is his brother. Philippe embraces his father for the first and last time as he dies, commenting that D'Artagnan was the one wearing the mask all along. D'Artagnan's right-hand man, Lieutenant Andre is furious at Louis for killing D'Artagnan and upon finding out Philippe was brother to Louis and of royal blood, orders his men to close the door and swears them to secrecy. By the time another battalion breaks in, the three Musketeers and Lieutenant Andre have made Louis and Philippe swap clothes and locked Louis in the iron mask. Philippe introduces Athos, Porthos, and Aramis as his royal council and truest friends. Posing as the king, Philippe orders the guards to take Louis and lock him away. The Musketeers give their respect and kneel before Philippe, honoring him as their true King. Philippe, Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and Queen Anne attend D'Artagnan's funeral, in which the three Musketeers are finally redeemed. After the funeral, Philippe asks Athos to love him like a son and Athos accepts, kissing Philippe's hand. Afterward, the three musketeers walk away through the long line of proud saluting musketeers under the helm of Lieutenant Andre as new captain, while the elite group chants their battle cry ""One for All, All for One"". Louis  now lives in a country house, where he is often visited by his mother. Thereafter, France was reformed under Philippe  who gave his people food, prosperity and peace. He is remembered as the greatest ruler of France.france swordplay mask palace bastille musketeer swashbuckler palace intrigue baroque 17th century louis xiv",False,tt0120744,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,182968902,0,0,4.227682914285714,-2.5293608277783246,100012264.92307693,120183418.76923077,,,,,,0,,,-7281977.0,12.0,17218023.0,1.0,-39808601.0,6.0,7191399.0,1.0,-2338243.0,15.0,3661757.0,1.0,6015365.0,14.0,23815365.0,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,402208848.0,424208848.0,1.0,15419151.0,35847722.428571425,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,50605889.5,64705889.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,12971636.0,-10853364.0,5.875,1.5,60772021.118274406

He says that every man is one day presented by a choice; A choice to make a difference, or to walk away and save himself. He explains that on that day, he learned something, to make a difference. He finishes: ""Too bad it was the day I died,"" as the camera shows him in New York City, slowly dying from a gunshot wound, as a caricature and an explosion is seen in his eye, as the scene blacks out. Six days earlier, in the year 2019, Toorop is shown living in New Serbia. Branded a terrorist, he is forbidden from returning to the United States, as he lived his life transporting immigrants around Eastern Europe to Western, and he makes a living working odd jobs, living his life in a small flat in dystopian city of Belgrade. One day, he is offered a courier contract by a Russian mobster, Gorsky . Toorop accepts in return for a chance to return to the United States, as he will be given an unfakeable U.N. passport  and 500,000 in cash. Gorsky instructs him to take a young woman, an orphan known only as Aurora , to New York City. He is provided with weapons, maps, and money to secure passage. Toorop travels by a reinforced armored car on an industrial lifting electromagnet hoisted by an Mil Mi-24 gunship. The helicopter drops the car off near a thousand-year old convent in Kyrgyzstan, now occupied by a new religion sect known as the Noelites. There he picks up a Noelite nun named Sister Rebeka  and her charge, Aurora. They travel by car to Troitsk in the border between Kazakhstan and Russia. In Troitsk, Toorop purchases tickets for a train to Vladivostok. When trying to board the train, Aurora inexplicably panics and flees from the crowd waiting to board the train. Toorop and Rebeka try to take her back despite her continued pleas not to. Seconds later, a bomb explodes in the crowd, sparing them because Aurora had bolted. Shaken, they board the train and Toorop demands an explanation for Aurora's apparent prescience. Rebeka shrugs it off as coincidence and explains that Aurora was probably just scared as it was her first time out of the convent. The train continues on to Vladivostok, passing a nuclear blast crater on the way. They arrive in a refugee camp in Vladivostok. Toorop contacts a Russian smuggler and old friend named Finn  in a nightclub and secures passage by submarine through the Bering Strait to Canada. An unknown group suddenly intercepts them and tries to offer Toorop a million dollars to relinquish Aurora to their custody. When this fails, they try to abduct her. After a fight the leader of the group tells Aurora that they knew her father. With this revelation, Aurora agrees to go with them, but Toorop stops her at the last second. In the morning, they go with the refugees across the frozen sea to board the submarine. However, to avoid satellite detection, the submarine can only surface for 2 minutes, leaving some refugees behind and even resorting to shooting them. Aurora, infuriated by the loss of life, starts to operate the 30-year-old submarine, without having ever learned about it. She states that she can 'feel them dying' and threatens the submarine crew with a gun but is eventually subdued by Toorop and the submarine continues to submerge. Rebeka and Toorop are both mystified by Aurora's outburst and her apparent knowledge of the submarine controls. Sister Rebeka explains to Toorop that Aurora could speak nineteen different languages by the age of two, and always seems to know things she has never learned. Three months before leaving with Toorop, she had begun acting in ways she never had before. Her change in behaviour began after a visit by a Noelite doctor who had administered a pill to Aurora. The doctor told her to go to New York City and arranged for Toorop to take them. Finn tells Toorop that he suspects Aurora was carrying a viral bomb, which he saw exploding in Uzbekistan 2 years prior. Toorop tells him that if she is carrying some kind of a virus, he will kill her instantly. She overhears this. On landing in Canada, they cross the border to the United States with snowbikes. Along the way they are spotted and attacked by two aerial drones patrolling the borderlines, wounding Toorop. Aurora again displays extraordinary medical knowledge as she pulls out a piece of metal from Toorop's wounds. Finn attempts to kill Toorop and Rebeka and take the passport and Aurora, but Toorop shoots him first. They cross the border safely and leave for New York by plane. In New York, in Toorop's old apartment, they learn from a news broadcast that the Noelite convent they were from had been hit by a missile the moment they crossed the Canadian border. This causes the group to realize that there is more going on than they know. The Noelites have become a major new salvationist religion, which vast numbers of people cling to as the world spirals out of control. However, in private meetings, it is seen that their High Priestess is really just after power, and tries to use various invented miracles to get more people to believe in the truth of her religion. Gorsky, working for the Noelites, had planted a tracking device in Toorop's passport, and then bombed the convent when he knew they were in the United States. The doctor who earlier saw Aurora in the convent then appears to examine her again. When he leaves, Aurora reveals to both Rebeka and Toorop that she is pregnant with twins, even though she is a virgin. Looking outside, Toorop sees Gorsky's men as well as the Noelite group, heavily armed and waiting for them. The High Priestess then calls Toorop and asks him to bring Aurora outside. As they were letting Aurora into the limousine, Rebeka warns Toorop with a glance. One of the guards had a gun pointed at them, ready to kill them once Aurora was handed over. Toorop changes his mind and starts a firefight with the two groups with the ultimate goal of getting the two women to safety. However, because of the tracking devices, Gorsky's men can lock onto Toorop with tracking rockets. Rebeka is shot and killed defending Aurora, who in turn shoots Toorop saying the words, ""I need you to live."" By dying, the rocket goes off target and explodes near Aurora instead. Aurora survives the rocket explosion apparently with seemingly supernatural powers, as the scene from the beginning is shown. Toorop's body is revived by Dr. Arthur Darquandier , using advanced medical techniques, but Toorop's right arm and left leg are replaced with cybernetics to undo the damage of being dead for over two hours. Darquandier explains that when Aurora was a fetus, he enhanced her by using a supercomputer to 'implant' intelligence into her brain. The Noelite group had him create Aurora to become pregnant at a certain time in order to use her as a vessel for twin babies with almost supernatural intelligence. The apparent ""virgin birth"" and the powers of her children were supposed to provide a manufactured ""miracle"" to boost membership of the Noelites. After she was born, the Noelites hired Gorsky to kill Darquandier, but Darquandier survived. He remained ""dead"" until he found his daughter in Russia with Toorop. Doctor Darquandier uses a machine to go through Toorop's memory to find what Aurora said to him before Toorop ""died"". In Toorop's memory, Aurora tells Toorop to ""go home."" Toorop, as well as several of Darquandier's men, leave the facility. En route to Darquandier's lab, the High Priestess calls Gorsky, at which point he is killed a missile sent by the High Priestess. Darquandier is later killed by the High Priestess, but Toorop has already escaped. Toorop goes to his old family house in the forest and finds Aurora, and as he takes her with him, they are found and chased by the Noelite henchmen, with the High Priestess personally shooting at them. He destroys the pursuers and he and Aurora escape. With Darquandier and High Priestess dead, Toorop stays with Aurora, rebuilding his old cottage. Six months later, Aurora gives birth to the children, but she says to Toorop that she was ""designed to breed"", not to live, indicating that she will die. Toorop stays with the children as their caretaker.submarine baby secret future mercenary prosecution pregnancy protection dystopia moral conflict smuggling vision cyberpunk sect",False,tt0364970,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,72108608,1,0,0.03012297142857143,-1.6278585820155915,,,,,41583296.54545455,69046932.9090909,,0,,,102514435.5,11.0,182514435.5,2.0,,0.0,,,-11955463.5,3.0,63044536.5,2.0,-2523139.8,7.0,42636860.2,5.0,60424046.0,16.0,92924046.0,3.0,31497228.0,12.0,67130561.33333333,3.0,,0.0,,,166465037.0,266465037.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,94726053.54545455,121407871.72727273,11.0,,,,73111837.0,88611837.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,116070171.0,176070171.0,1.0,,,,41251392.0,92501392.0,4.0,,,,,,,71574273.0,184074273.0,2.0,118258432.5,270758432.5,2.0,,,,,,,85072577.0,120072577.0,1.0,,,89650087.90666667,35991421.24,6.125,3.0,95612307.5388973

The focus transitions to police captain Barthélémy Karas, as he defuses a hostage situation by killing the hostage-takers. Karas is soon after charged with solving the mystery of the disappearance of Ilona. Karas begins by contacting Dr. Jonas Muller, a former Avalon scientist familiar with Ilona. Muller had been working to cure progeria, which his brother was suffering from. Muller worked for Avalon as their top scientist but left after he failed to cure his brother. He took up new work at a free clinic. After Karas probes Jonas he finds that ""No one ever leaves Avalon"", throwing the corporation under suspicion. Karas leaves to visit one of Avalon's CEOs and questions him about Ilona's disappearance, suggesting that he may have been sleeping with her, to which the CEO replies ""I sleep with my wife, I sleep with my secretary, I even sleep with my sister-in-law but I would never sleep with one of my researchers"". After following a series of dead leads, Karas finds Illona's car travelling on the road. He captures the driver, one of the henchmen of Farfella, an Arab Muslim mobster and a childhood friend of Karas in the casbah. In return Farfella gives him a footage of Illona's car initially being stolen by an incredibly old man. Karas turns to Ilona's sister, Bislane. He asks her to break into the Avalon archives as she is currently employed there, and Bislane discovers that a Dr. Nakata worked with Muller and that their quest to find a cure failed when some of the children they were testing on started to mutate, causing them to destroy all evidence of their work. Once they escape from Avalon security, Karas opens up to Bislane and tells her that he and Farfella were raised on the streets and seemed to work with gangs. After a mission went wrong they ended up in a prison cell with Farfella escaping leaving Karas to the mercy of the other gang members. Karas then puts Bislane under false arrest to protect her from Avalon. As this occurs, Ilona is shown confined in a cyber ball, with the old man controlling what she sees. Dr. Muller tells Karas that Ilona found the secret to eternal life  and he couldn't let Avalon have it, revealing why he kidnapped her. Muller is mistakenly shot by the police when Karas confronts him. It is revealed that the old man is Jonas's younger brother, now immortal but trapped in an old man's body. Karas is eventually shot after he rescues Ilona; she refuses to take the fake passport to start a new life, wanting to live forever with her discover. Karas is then forced to shoot her with the CEO watching on CCTV cameras. As Karas is mortally injured from his gunshot wound, he imagines himself apologizing to Bislane for killing her sister, for which she forgives him. It then cuts to Jonas's little brother now living as a tramp, throwing his picture of him and his brother together in a burning bin. The last scene shows an advert for Avalon with an old woman becoming young again saying, ""With Avalon, I know I'm beautiful and I'm going to stay that way.""paris, france identity underworld monopoly future beauty victim dystopia boss police president disappearance cgi black and white theft scientist researcher corporation",True,tt0386741,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1831348,0,0,-8.828825542714984,-3.847336948521819,,,,,,,4175107.0,3,10925107.0,2.0,6824886.666666667,8.0,50491553.333333336,3.0,-6876149.0,2.0,16123851.0,1.0,41584912.5,21.0,90918245.83333333,6.0,30124839.444444444,30.0,46069283.88888889,9.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42905608.21111111,15166719.322222222,8.0,4.2,92887866.92008553

When Serafine Pigot leaps off the Eiffel Tower just before Andy is about to bungee jump, he executes a mid-air rescue. She vanishes into the night, leaving Andy intrigued – and also unaware that she is the daughter of David Kessler and Alex Price, the couple seen 16 years earlier in the first film. That night, Andy, Chris, and Brad attend a night club called ""Club de la Lune"". The club's owner, Claude, is actually the leader of a werewolf society that uses the club as a way to lure people in to be killed. Serafine arrives, tells Andy to run away and transforms into a werewolf. The club owners transform into werewolves as well and butcher all the guests. Chris escapes, Brad is eaten by a werewolf and Andy is bitten by a werewolf. The next day, Andy discovers himself transforming into a werewolf. Brad's ghost appears to Andy and explains Andy's werewolf condition. In order for Andy to become normal again, he must eat the heart of the werewolf that bit him; in order for Brad's ghost to be at rest, the werewolf that ate his heart must be killed, too. Andy hooks up with an American tourist named Amy, but transforms and kills her. Andy also kills a cop who had been tailing him, suspecting Andy was involved in the Club de la Lune massacre. Andy is arrested but escapes. He begins to see Amy's ghost as well, and she begins trying to kill him. Claude and his henchmen ask Andy to join their society, but to prove his loyalty, Andy must kill Chris. Serafine rescues Andy, explaining that her father prepared a drug to control werewolf transformations, but instead the drug forces werewolves to immediately transform into their beast form. Claude and the other werewolves then raid Serafine's stepfather's lab and kill him, taking the drug to transform immediately. Serafine and Andy learn of another party Claude has planned and infiltrate it. They help the partygoers escape and Andy manages to kill the werewolf that ate Brad's heart, thus setting Brad free. The cops arrive and a fight ensues. Andy and Serafine manage to kill many werewolves, with Serafine shifting to her beast form to fight when she runs out of ammunition. Andy does not know she has transformed and shoots Serafine. Claude makes his way onto a subway train, but slips onto the tracks. A train slams into him, causing him to transform back to a human. He tries to take another dose of the drug, but Andy stops him. As they fight, Andy discovers that Claude is the werewolf that bit him. Andy then kills him and eats his heart, breaking the werewolf curse. By some miracle, Serafine survives. The film ends with Serafine and Andy celebrating their wedding atop the Statue of Liberty.

Seth takes Veronica back to the warehouse that serves as both his home and laboratory, and shows her a project that will change the world: a set of ""Telepods"" that allows instantaneous teleportation of an object from one pod to another. Veronica eventually agrees to document Seth's work. Although the Telepods can transport inanimate objects, they do not work properly on living things, as is demonstrated when a live baboon is turned inside-out during an experiment. Seth and Veronica begin a romantic relationship. Their first sexual encounter provides inspiration for Seth, who successfully reprograms the Telepod computer to cope with living creatures, and teleports a second baboon with no apparent harm. Flushed with this success, Brundle wants to spend a romantic evening with Veronica, but she suddenly departs before they can celebrate. Brundle's judgment soon becomes impaired by alcohol and his fear that Veronica is secretly rekindling her relationship with her editor and former lover, Stathis Borans . In reality, Veronica has left to confront Borans about a veiled threat of his  to publish the Telepod story without her consent. Upset, Brundle teleports himself in Veronica's absence, unaware that a common housefly is in the pod with him. Brundle emerges from the receiving pod, seemingly normal. Seth and Veronica reconcile, and, shortly after his teleportation, Seth begins to exhibit what at first appear to be beneficial effects of the process—such as increased strength, stamina and sexual potency. He believes this to be a result of the teleporting process ""purifying"" his body as it was being rebuilt. However, he soon becomes violent, and eventually realizes that something went horribly wrong when his fingernails begin falling off. Brundle checks his computer's records, and discovers that the Telepod computer, confused by the presence of two separate life-forms in the sending pod, merged him with the fly at the molecular-genetic level. Over the next few weeks, Brundle continues to deteriorate, losing various body parts and becoming progressively less human in appearance. He theorizes that he is slowly becoming a hybrid creature that is neither human nor insect . He starts to exhibit fly-like characteristics, such as vomiting digestive enzymes onto his food in order to dissolve it, and the ability to cling to walls and ceilings. Brundle realizes that he is losing his human reason and compassion, and that he is now being driven by primitive impulses he cannot control. Attempting to find a cure for his condition, Brundle installs a fusion program into the Telepod computer in order to dilute the fly genes in his body with pure human DNA. To her horror, Veronica learns that she is pregnant by Seth, and she cannot be sure if the child was conceived before or after his fateful teleportation. Veronica and Borans persuade a reluctant doctor to perform an abortion in the middle of the night, but Brundle abducts Veronica before the abortion can be carried out, and begs her to carry the child to term, since it could potentially be the last remnant of his untainted humanity. Veronica refuses, afraid that the child will be a hideous mutant. Meanwhile, Borans breaks into Brundle's lab with a shotgun and comes to Veronica's rescue, but is seriously injured and nearly killed by the almost fully transformed Brundle, who dissolves Borans' left hand and right foot with his corrosive vomit-drop enzyme. Brundle then reveals his desperate, last-ditch plan to Veronica — he will use the three Telepods  to fuse himself, Veronica, and their unborn child together into one entity, so they can be the ""ultimate family"". Veronica frantically resists Brundle's efforts to drag her into Telepod 1 and then accidentally tears off his jaw, triggering his final transformation into a monstrous combination of man and insect. The ""Brundlefly"" traps Veronica inside Telepod 1, then steps into Telepod 2. However, the wounded Borans manages to sever the power cables connected to Veronica's Telepod with his shotgun, allowing Veronica to escape unharmed. Breaking out of its own pod as the fusion process is activated, Brundlefly is gruesomely fused with chunks of metal and other components from Telepod 2. As the mortally wounded Brundlefly-Telepod fusion creature crawls out of the receiving pod, it silently begs Veronica to end its suffering with Borans' shotgun. Veronica hesitates for a moment, and then pulls the trigger, killing Brundle.experiment mutant mutation transformation to beam remake scientist science bodily dismemberment parasite underneath skin fly the insect body horror craziness animal horror melting",False,tt0091064,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,60629159,0,0,3.041943933333333,2.3644495162840293,164816455.0,183316455.0,21010864.0,26010864.0,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,55214818.96773516

Former steel workers Gary ""Gaz"" Schofield and Dave Horsefall have resorted to stealing scrap metal from the abandoned mills to sell. Gaz is facing trouble from his ex-wife, Mandy, over child support payments that he's failed to make since losing his job. Gaz's son, Nathan, loves his father but wishes they could do more ""normal stuff"" in their time together. One day, Gaz spots a crowd of women lined up outside a local club to see a Chippendale's striptease act. He gets the idea to form his own strip tease group using local men in hopes of making enough money to pay off his child support obligations. The first to join the group is Lomper, a security guard at Harrison's, the steel mill where Dave and Gaz once worked. After finally being laid off, Lomper attempts to commit suicide, but is rescued by Dave who convinces him to join the group. Next they recruit Gerald Cooper, a former manager at the plant, who has been hiding from his wife the fact that he's been laid off. Gaz and Dave see Gerald and his wife, Linda, at a dance class and recruit him to teach them some actual dance moves. The four men hold an open audition to recruit more members and settle on Horse, an older man who is nevertheless a good dancer, and Guy, who can't dance but proves to be well-endowed when he exposes himself to the four men, and even Nathan. When they are approached by local women who have heard of their show, Gaz declares that their show will be better than the Chippendales dancers because they'll go ""the Full Monty"" and remove all their clothes. With not much left to lose, and a sold-out show, the men decide to go for it for one night. Dave, having re-gained his confidence with help from his wife, Jean, joins the rest of the group minutes before they go on stage. However, Gaz himself refuses to do it because there are men in the audience, even when Nathan, who has secretly come, tells him that his ex-wife was there. Nathan later forces his hand and Gaz, proud of his son, performs in front of the audience and Mandy who seems to see him in a new light.

Henry is impressed by Stanton's genuine warmth and empathy with people. He joins Stanton's inner circle of political advisers: Stanton's formidable wife, Susan Stanton ; ruthless, redneck political strategist Richard Jemmons ; intelligent and attractive spokeswoman Daisy Green ; and sly political operator Howard Ferguson  as they journey to New Hampshire, the first state to hold a presidential primary. After Stanton completes an impressive debate performance against his Democratic rivals, Henry’s ex-girlfriend shows up to question Stanton about his arrest during the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. The team become worried that Stanton’s past indiscretions may be used against him by the press and his political opponents. They hire Jack and Susan's old friend, the tough but unbalanced Libby Holden , to respond to any attacks designed to undermine Stanton's candidacy, as well as anticipate problems such as allegations about Stanton's notorious womanising. One of Stanton's mistresses, Cashmere McLeod , produces secret taped conversations between them to prove they had an affair. Henry discovers that the tapes have been doctored, so Libby tracks down the man responsible for the tapes and forces him at gunpoint to confess his guilt in a signed letter to the American public. The campaign is then rocked by a fresh allegation when Stanton's old friend, ""Big Willie"" McCullison  approaches Henry to tell him that his 16-year old daughter is pregnant and that Stanton is the father. Henry and Howard tell Willie he must allow his daughter to undergo an amniocentesis to determine Stanton's paternity. Although they convince Willie to remain silent on the issue, Henry is nonetheless sickened and disillusioned with the experience. Realising the campaign is falling behind in the polls, Stanton's team adopt a new strategy. Stanton begins going on the offensive by attacking his nearest rival, Senator Lawrence Harris  for being insufficiently pro-Israel and threatening to cut Medicare. Harris confronts Stanton during a radio debate but suffers a heart attack after the encounter. He subsequently withdraws from the race and is replaced by his friend, former Florida Governor Fred Picker . Picker's wholesome, straight-talking image proves an immediate threat to the campaign. Henry and Libby decide to seek out information about Picker’s past. They discover from his brother-in-law, Eddie Reyes , that Picker had a cocaine addiction as Governor, which led to the disintegration of his first marriage. They also meet Lorenzo Delgado , with whom Picker had a homosexual affair. Not expecting the information to ever be used, Libby and Henry share their findings with Jack and Susan, but are dismayed when they both decide to leak the information to the press. Libby says that if Jack does so, she will reveal that he tampered with the results of the paternity test, proving that he slept with Willie's daughter. Libby commits suicide after she realizes she spent her life idealizing Jack and Susan only to learn how flawed they truly are. Racked with guilt over Libby's death, Stanton takes the incriminating information to Picker, and apologizes for seeking it out. Picker admits to his past indiscretions, and agrees to withdraw from the race and to endorse Stanton. Henry intends to quit the campaign, admitting he has become deeply disillusioned with the whole political process. Stanton begs Henry to reconsider, persuading him that the two of them can make history. Months later, President Stanton is dancing at the Inaugural Ball with First Lady, Susan. He shakes the hands of all his campaign staff, the last of whom is Henry.the white house u.s. president presidential election scandal new hampshire extramarital affair presidential candidate",False,tt0119942,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,39017984,0,0,-0.6658984738934743,-2.5293608277783246,-38086412.5,26913587.5,13022875.7,29472875.7,,,,0,,,35662014.5,9.0,47078681.166666664,6.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,435023.0,2181987.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11737911.0,23237911.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,47078681.166666664,35662014.5,1.125,6.0,60772021.118274406

He becomes the first person to ever complete the Trinity Great Court Run – running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12. Abrahams achieves an undefeated string of victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with a leading Gilbert and Sullivan soprano, Sybil . Eric Liddell , born in China of Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie  disapproves of Liddell's plans to pursue competitive running. But Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary. When they first race against each other, Liddell beats Abrahams. Abrahams takes it extremely badly, but Sam Mussabini , a professional trainer whom he had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters . They allege it is ungentlemanly for an amateur to ""play the tradesman"" by employing a professional coach. Abrahams realizes this is a cover for their anti-Semitism and class-based sense of superiority, and dismisses their concern. When Eric Liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, his sister Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. Eric tells her that though he intends to eventually return to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when running, and that not to run would be to dishonour God: ""I believe that God made me for a purpose. But He also made me fast, and when I run, I feel His pleasure."" The two athletes, after years of training and racing, are accepted to represent Great Britain in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. Also accepted are Abrahams' Cambridge friends, Lord Andrew Lindsay , Aubrey Montague , and Henry Stallard . While boarding the boat to Paris for the Olympics, Liddell learns the news that the heat for his 100 metre race will be on a Sunday. He refuses to run the race – despite strong pressure from the Prince of Wales and the British Olympic committee – because his Christian convictions prevent him from running on the Sabbath. Hope appears in the form of Liddell's teammate Lord Andrew Lindsay. Having already won a silver medal in the 400 metres hurdles, Lindsay proposes to yield his place in the 400 metre race on the following Thursday to Liddell, who gratefully agrees. His religious convictions in the face of national athletic pride make headlines around the world. Liddell delivers a sermon at the Paris Church of Scotland that Sunday, and quotes from Isaiah 40, ending with: :But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. Abrahams is badly beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200 metre race. He knows his last chance for a medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race, and wins. His coach Sam Mussabini is overcome that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams can get on with his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected for the sake of running. Before Liddell's race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now far longer 400 metre race. But one of the American runners, Jackson Scholz, hands Liddell a note of support for his convictions. Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal. The British team returns home triumphant. As the film ends, onscreen text explains that Abrahams married Sybil, and became the elder statesman of British athletics.

He and his men guard Hadrian's Wall against the 'Woads', a group of native Britons who are rebels against Roman rule, led by the mysterious Merlin . He is not the first Arthur&nbsp;— for generations, his ancestors have manned the Wall, leading Sarmatian auxiliaries. As the film starts, Arthur and his remaining knights Lancelot , Bors , Tristan , Gawain , Galahad  and Dagonet ([[Ray Stevenson  are expecting discharge from the service of the Empire after faithfully serving for 15 years . They fight off an attack by the Woads on the Roman escort bringing their discharges. However, on the night they ought to receive their freedom, they are dispatched on a final and possibly suicidal mission by Bishop Germanus  in the freezing winter to rescue the important Roman family of Marius Honorius  from impending capture by the invading Saxons, led by their chief Cerdic  and his son Cynric . Marius' son, Alecto, is the Pope's favorite godson and may be ""destined to be Pope one day"", according to the Bishop. The knights are charged with this rescue because Rome is withdrawing from Britain, now considered an indefensible outpost. At the remote estate, Arthur explains his mission to Marius, who becomes defensive and refuses to leave his grand home. Marius is revealed to have oppressed his serfs on the pretense of speaking for God. While being shown an elder who has been whipped and left tied up out in the elements for asking Marius for more food for the serfs, Arthur advises that Marius does not speak for God. He frees the elder and tells them all that they were ""free from their first breath"". Arthur soon discovers Marius has also immured pagans: a Woad, Guinevere , and a small boy, Lucan. Arthur frees them and decides to take everyone, along with Marius' family, back to Hadrian's Wall. Along the journey, Guinevere tells Arthur of the ""fairy tales"" she'd heard of him, and Arthur is revealed to be half Celt . Arthur resets the fingers in Guinevere's hand. One night, Guinevere takes Arthur to meet with Merlin, the leader of the Woads and her father. At first, Arthur thinks Guinevere has betrayed him, but Merlin has come in peace. It is revealed in flashback that Arthur's mother had died in a Woad attack when he was a boy. Merlin says that he did not wish for Arthur's mother to die; she was of their blood, as is Arthur. Arthur's famous sword, Excalibur, is also shown to be his father's, which marked his father's burial mound. Arthur pulled it from his father's burial mound in an effort to rescue his mother from a burning building. Merlin suggests an alliance between the Woads and the Sarmatian knights against the invading Saxons. Along the route one dawn, Marius forces a standoff with his own soldiers, taking the boy Lucan hostage. Even his wife is angered at this. Unlike Marius, she is a kindly person who actually helps heal Guinevere's wounds. Guinevere uses a bow to shoot Marius dead; his guards stand down and aid the knights in getting all the people to the wall. Struck by Rome leaving its subjects to the mercy of the Saxons, Arthur is further disillusioned when he learns that Bishop Pelagius, whose teachings about the equality of all men inspired the brotherhood of his Round Table, has been executed as a heretic by order of Bishop Germanus himself. Tristan returns from scouting the area and tells Arthur that a whole Saxon army is on the move. The group soon encounter the Saxons at an ice-covered lake. The knights stay behind to hold up the Saxons and allow the refugees to escape. Greatly outnumbered, Arthur, Guinevere and the knights attempt to repel them with arrows; the battle is won when Dagonet runs to the middle of the ice and breaks it with an axe, at the cost of his life — however, many Saxons are killed. In due course, Arthur and his remaining men forsake Roman citizenship and form an alliance with the Woads to fight the Saxons. In the climactic battle, the ""Battle of Badon Hill"" set just south of the now abandoned Hadrian's Wall, the Woads catapult flaming missiles at the Saxon army, and when the hosts meet, Guinevere engages in combat with Cynric. Cerdic fights and kills Tristan before facing off with Arthur. Meanwhile, Cynric disarms Guinevere before Lancelot intervenes and duels Cynric alone. While another Saxon captures Lancelot's attention for a moment, Cynric shoots Lancelot with a Saxon crossbow. Lancelot then throws his sword into Cynric, killing him. Lancelot dies with Guinevere at his side. Arthur kills Cerdic, and the Saxons are defeated. Though Arthur is victorious, the events of the film have led to the loss of his faith in Rome as a bastion of justice. After realizing that the Rome of his ideals exists only in his dreams, Arthur also despairs over the deaths of his men. The film ends with Arthur and Guinevere's marriage. Merlin then proclaims him to be their king. King Arthur, Queen Guinevere, and his remaining knights promise to lead the Britons, united with the defeat of the Saxons and retreat of the Romans, against future invaders. The last scene shows Lancelot, Dagonet and Tristan reincarnated as horses and roaming the lands freely, while Lancelot speaks of the fact that their names will live forever in legend.roman empire merlin king arthur battle northumbria hadrian’s wall",True,tt0349683,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,203567857,0,0,0.6963988083333333,1.9257596443831189,32779784.5,87279784.5,9269475.0,54769475.0,24866678.2,43466678.2,67954044.0,3,87754044.0,1.0,,0.0,,,36556741.0,2.0,38314320.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-3611233.0,0.0,27388767.0,1.0,5858355.0,3.0,10158355.0,1.0,28049560.0,3.0,143049560.0,1.0,256929795.0,281929795.0,1.0,233440782.0,327440782.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13976432.5,44226432.5,4.0,94013509.0,173013509.0,1.0,32779784.5,87279784.5,2.0,19853189.666666668,58519856.333333336,3.0,,,,,,,42235718.0,81569051.33333333,3.0,-28433000.0,16567000.0,2.0,,,,94013509.0,173013509.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80989651.0,172989651.0,1.0,-6439124.0,7060876.0,1.0,14093343.8,33022379.8,5.0,,,61333009.3,26961493.4,1.375,1.2,84824632.31357588

He sneaks into a building, distracts two guard dogs with toys, knocks out two guards and seduces a woman who threatens him. He is awoken from his fantasy just as he is about to kiss the woman by his sidekick, Angus Bough . After being assured that English has checked the submarine hatch codes personally, the real Agent One  leaves on a mission. The audience then learn that Agent One died in action when his submarine hatch ""failed to open"". A bomb then wipes out Britain's remaining agents, all of whom were attending the funeral of Agent One, leaving only English. Nobody notices the hearse, which sped from the scene minutes earlier. Before his death, Agent One was investigating a plot to steal the Crown Jewels. Together with Bough, English takes over the case. Whilst investigating, English becomes attracted to a mysterious woman, Lorna Campbell , whom he meets at the unveiling of the newly restored Crown Jewels, where English is in charge of the security. The power to the room is cut, and English accidentally knocks out the chief of security, before pretending to fight a criminal in another room in an attempt to cover up this fact. Later, Bough and English follow a tunnel and find the Jewels, but fail to stop the thieves after English accidentally ejects the magazine from his pistol. English chases their car, a hearse, but accidentally trails the wrong one after being stopped by a red light and went the wrong way. Convinced the burial party he discovers is an act, he arrests the mourners and the priest before realizing his mistake. Bough rescues him by pretending that English is an escaped asylum inmate. The pair then uncovers the mastermind of the theft, French prison entrepreneur and descendant of William the Conqueror, Pascal Sauvage . English reports his suspicions to the head of MI7, Pegasus , who does not believe him. In the car park, one of Sauvage's henchmen attacks English and Bough, and escapes when English mistakenly attacks Bough. English and Bough infiltrate Sauvage's headquarters via parachute, but English lands on the wrong building, abseiling the identical London Hospital. He holds several staff and patients at gunpoint, before realizing his mistake. English activates a DVD player, exposing Sauvage's plan to instate himself as King, using an impostor, Archbishop of Canterbury . After English accidentally injects himself with muscle relaxant, he and Bough are rescued by Lorna from two of Sauvage's men. She turns out to be an Interpol agent, also on Sauvage's tail . Along with Bough, they gatecrash a party held by Sauvage. The muscle relaxant not yet worn off, English accidentally insults the Foreign Secretary . One of the henchmen reports English to Sauvage, a friend of English's unwitting boss, the latter of whom dismisses Bough and English. Sauvage decides that English knows too much and sends henchmen to force the Queen to sign a letter of abdication, as she does so for her precious pet dog. Sauvage is informed by British officials that, as the closest surviving relative of the Queen, the position of monarch now belongs to him. Lorna visits English at his flat, as his mission was reassigned to her, and persuades English to join her. They travel to France, infiltrate Sauvage's chateau, and overhear his proposal to turn the United Kingdom into a giant prison. However, English accidentally triggers a microphone, alerting Sauvage to their presence and in an attempt to steal an incriminating DVD, English accidentally drops it onto a tray full of identical discs, and takes the wrong one. Taken hostage, they are freed by Bough and return to England on the day of the coronation. At Sauvage's coronation, English sneaks in with Lorna, the former disguised as the English bishop in front of Sauvage. He publicly accuses Sauvage of treason, and unaware that the fake Archbishop is no longer being used, English attempts to pull off his face, believing it to be a mask and then pulls down his trousers to look for a tattoo that says ""Jesus is coming, look busy"". English then radios to Bough to tell him to play the DVD they retrieved. Bough does so, resulting in three-quarters of the world's population watching English, in a shower cap and underpants, dancing and miming along to ""Does Your Mother Know"" by ABBA. English escapes, but comes back, swinging from a wire above Sauvage and the Archbishop, grabbing the crown before it touches Sauvage's head. Sauvage reveals his true intentions to London by pulling a gun and shooting at English, telling London that it will stand in line and do what he's told no matter what, including letting him turn the country into a prison. In the following struggle, English is inadvertently crowned instead. He places Sauvage under arrest, reveals his plot to the Queen and allows her to return to the throne, in return for a knighthood. The film ends with English driving Lorna to the top of a mountain where Johnny accidentally presses the eject button whilst about to kiss her, and Lorna shoots into the sky. There is also a short scene in the credits showing Lorna landing in a swimming pool where Bough is sitting and as the orange haired criminal described earlier by English lowers his newspaper.spy hero queen intelligence coronation funeral secret agent weapon slapstick farce spoof explosion agent pen duringcreditsstinger queen elizabeth ii",False,tt0274166,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,160583018,0,0,3.01457545,-14.415123713336484,64989441.73913044,99706833.04347827,51781043.5,55331043.5,,,233212670.0,6,251212670.0,1.0,33258802.8,19.0,52538802.8,5.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,118582776.0,8.0,134582776.0,1.0,52000000.0,5.0,58000000.0,1.0,-64831034.0,1.0,35168966.0,1.0,,,,12232661.5,66232661.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,52000000.0,58000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,87280838.14285715,109403695.28571428,7.0,5112895.0,62112895.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,45274015.5,57499015.5,4.0,,,,,,,,,106300642.96,74444642.96,4.875,1.8,79569518.43496008

At first Creasy distances himself socially from Pita, but the two develop a friendship. After a piano lesson, Pita is abducted in public and Creasy is shot multiple times. The Ramoses agree to deliver a dead drop ransom of US10 million per the instructions of ""The Voice"" , the mastermind of the kidnapping ring. The drop, however, is ambushed by members of a Mexican crime syndicate and the money is stolen, resulting in The Voice notifying the Ramoses that Pita will not be returned. Upon hearing the news, Creasy leaves the hospital before fully recovering from his wounds and vows to Pita's mother Lisa  that he will kill everyone involved in her abduction. His friend of his CIA days, Paul Rayburn , who runs a security firm in Mexico, hands him weapons in his quest for revenge. With the help of Mariana Guerrero , a journalist, and Miguel Manzano  of the AFI Creasy begins hunting down and killing those involved in Pita's abduction with great success. Each person leads him to the next by providing vital information. He eventually learns that Samuel's attorney, Jordan Kalfus  stole 7.5 million before the ransom money was sent to the drop. Samuel confesses to Creasy that he agreed to Kalfus' plan for Pita's kidnapping to pay off business debts with his share of the insurance money. He also confesses that when Pita was not returned, he killed Kalfus. Samuel then commits suicide. After some digging, Mariana writes an article revealing The Voice's identity as Daniel Sánchez. Creasy shows up to Daniel's ex-wife's house and is shot by his brother Aurelio , who then tries unsuccessfully to escape. Creasy calls Daniel, who reveals that Pita is still alive and offers to free her if Creasy surrenders himself with Aurelio. Creasy agrees and he and Lisa meet at the exchange site where the kidnappers release Pita as Creasy releases Aurelio. Creasy then surrenders himself and is driven away by the kidnappers and succumbs to his wounds. Daniel Sánchez is killed by Miguel Manzano during a police raid later that same day.mexico cia based on novel or book mexico city kidnapping diary bible bodyguard stuffed animal cell phone alcoholic grenade launcher child kidnapping bloodshed swim meet",False,tt0328107,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,130293714,0,0,0.8613387714285714,1.9257596443831189,,,-9937594.0,2062406.0,146404396.0,212404396.0,4005796.6666666665,23,19339130.0,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,71180417.8,26.0,97380417.8,5.0,,0.0,,,264692268.0,3.0,351692268.0,1.0,-4567313.0,17.0,1432687.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,64151347.333333336,123151347.33333333,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,28049560.0,143049560.0,1.0,,,,23475664.333333332,59975664.333333336,3.0,,,,-7032871.0,12717129.0,2.0,,,,,,,28049560.0,143049560.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,137414781.33333334,210748114.66666666,3.0,80989651.0,172989651.0,1.0,80989651.0,172989651.0,1.0,,,,,,,4868943.0,32868943.0,1.0,,,117461125.7,83827792.36666666,8.625,2.5,84824632.31357588

On the other side of the world, Garfield the cat  is living in his owner Jon's house a year after the first movie and believes that he's the king of the home. That night, Jon invites his girlfriend Liz  over for dinner, and is planning to propose to her. Jon is about to propose, but is unable to find the ring because Garfield took it so as to keep Jon all to himself. Garfield also eats the turkey dinner Jon made for Liz. Liz tells Jon that she's been asked to travel to Great Britain for a veterinarian convention, and is flying there tomorrow. After she leaves, Jon decides to go to England to be with Liz and propose to her there. The next day, Garfield thinks that he and Odie are going with Jon to Britain, but instead they are sent to the kennel where they are to stay while Jon is in London. Garfield throws a tantrum, and damages his and Odie's cage door. The two of them get out of the cage and escape into Jon's car, hiding in his luggage. Meanwhile, at Carlyle Castle, Prince has just been named the new owner of the castle , but a man named Lord Dargis , the nephew of the past owner, expected that the owner would give him all the land. Prince's assistant, Winston, is worried that Dargis will get rid of Prince in order to get the land. Dargis puts Prince in a picnic basket and throws him in a river which leads to London in order to have the soliciters believe Prince has run away. Jon arrives at his hotel and is about to propose to Liz when Garfield and Odie come out of his bag. Jon is surprised, and leaves Garfield and Odie in the hotel room while he and Liz go sightseeing. Garfield and Odie escape in search of Jon when the hotel maid comes in. Meanwhile, Dargis tells the soliciterss and tells them he will be the next owner of the palace. The animals who are kept in a barn in the palace receive about the Prince's disappearance from a crow. After sending a mouse to look around, they also find out that Dargis is planning to kill them in order to spare more land and serve them to the guests. Meanwhile, the butler of Caryle Castle, Smithee, is told by Dargis to go to London to get his new suit. He finds Garfield and Odie during their travels and mistakes him for Prince, bringing him to the castle and leaving Odie alone. Prince manages to get out of a gutter in front of Odie, to his confusion. Jon finds the two and, mistaking Prince for Garfield, takes them back to his hotel room. At the castle, the animals realize that Garfield is not Prince, due to his voice and attitude, but are not concerned as he just needs to look like him to fool the solicitors into thinking Prince has returned. Dargis mistakes Garfield for Prince, and unsuccessfully attempts to have him killed. At the hotel, Odie brings Jon and Liz's map to Prince. Prince spots Carlyle Castle on the map, and sets off to return to the palace. Jon realizes that Garfield is gone and goes off with Odie to find him. Jon does not find him, but Odie finds a newspaper containing Prince's picture and shows Jon that Garfield could've been mistaken for Prince. Jon and Odie rent a car and head for Carlyle Castle. In Carlyle Castle, Garfield hears Preston and Winston's words about Garfield being a horrible replacement for Prince. This upsets him, but he soon decides to find Jon. Liz, however, has arrived at the castle for the convention, and Garfield finds Dargis hitting on Liz. Garfield distracts Dargis, and is subsequently thrown in a dungeon underneath the castle. Jon meets up with Smithee and after explaining the story, he decides to come with them. Garfield is rescued by Winston. but decides to head back to London, citing Winston's earlier remarks about him being simply a housecat. On his way out, he comes face to face with Prince in a ""fake mirror"" scene, each copying the other's movements until Garfield fools Prince into fainting. Prince explains that he had been living Garfield's life for the last three days, and that he should return to his owner, but Garfield tells them that they should fight Dargis, and decides to stay. The animals set traps all over the palace, with Garfield and Prince luring him into the traps. They manage to run him around the entire castle, making the solicitors believe he has gone crazy. Jon and Odie arrive as Dargis gets a crossbow and aims it at the cats and the solicitors, forcing them to sign the deed of the castle over to him. Odie bites Dargis on the butt, making him throwing the cross bow away. Dargis takes out a gun and holds Liz hostage, but Nigel the ferret enters Dargis' pants, and he is soon punched out by Jon and falls to the floor. Smithee brings out troops of the police to arrest him. Liz sees Garfield and Prince, not knowing the difference between the two of them. Garfield kicks Odie off the chair they are sitting on in order to prove who is who. Jon takes out the ring and proposes to Liz. Liz happily accepts, and the animals, Garfield, and Prince party at the end of the film, celebrating their freedom.london, england cat mistake in person luxury wretch nobility",False,tt0455499,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,141702264,1,2,1.3617044,-3.847336948521819,,,249359555.0,459359555.0,,,,0,,,2467327.0,2.0,3000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,43147106.333333336,31.0,63380439.666666664,3.0,,0.0,,,26332385.0,2.0,30332385.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32237608.22222222,23982272.77777778,4.375,1.6666666666666667,92887866.92008553

Bobby slams Marty's head against a refrigerator. Marty, Bobby, Ali, and Lisa all go out on a double date. While Ali performs oral sex on Bobby, Lisa and Marty have sex and enter into a relationship. Lisa later confesses that she ""loves him and would do anything for him."" Lisa takes a pregnancy test and learns she is pregnant, most likely with Marty's child. However, prior to this, Bobby had burst into the bedroom, interrupting Marty and Lisa having sex, and beaten up Marty with the words, ""I'm next..."". Although it isn't shown, Lisa tells her friends that she was raped by Bobby, while Marty was unconscious. She now fears the child might be his. Bobby's verbal abuse and cruelty worsens, culminating in an incident where Ali initially agrees to a consensual sexual encounter with him, but withdraws her consent after Bobby puts on a video of gay pornography. Bobby then rapes her. Lisa eventually proposes that the friends murder Bobby, in part to defend Marty, who has a homoerotic relationship with Bobby and is a frequent victim of emotional and physical abuse at the hands of Bobby. Ali recruits her new boyfriend, Donny , and the two of them drive to a rehabilitation center to pick up Ali's friend, Heather . Meanwhile Lisa recruits her cousin, Derek , to help. After some drug use, video games, and sex between Donny, Heather, and Ali, the wayward teens make their first attempt, centered on luring Bobby into another sexual encounter with Ali. The idea is for Ali to shoot him during the encounter, but she backs out and passes the gun to Lisa, who is hiding in the room, while Bobby is distracted. While Ali and Bobby are having sex, Lisa takes out the gun and aims at Bobby's head, but she backs out when she realizes that the gun can be traced back to them because it belongs to her mother. This failed attempt does not dampen Lisa's determination, as she repeatedly tells the others that she wants Bobby dead. Realizing they need help, they hire a supposed ""hitman"" . The ""hitman"" refuses to help because he believes their plan will backfire easily; he says if they can come up with a better plan, he will assist them. As the story progresses, it becomes comically apparent that the ""hitman"" is just a tough-talking adolescent. Initially, much of the group dismisses the entire idea as a lark, but because Lisa is so adamant, eventually they all decide to go through with it. They come up with another plan - luring Bobby to a canal, where they plan to kill him. They go to the hitman with the new plan; when he asks for justification, Ali and Lisa tell him that Bobby raped them, and they relay details about his mistreatment of Marty. The hitman agrees someone like that deserves to die and says he will help them. Derek initially thinks they are simply going to size Bobby up, but Lisa makes it clear to him that she plans to see Bobby dead. It becomes apparent that while Lisa, Marty and the hitman are serious about carrying out the murder, the other teenagers are indifferent. As the teenagers arrive at the swamp, the hitman tells them what to do: Ali is to coax Bobby near the edge of the swamp away from the group. If Bobby does not suspect any trouble, Heather is to give the group a signal by going up to them and asking if there are any alligators in the canal. Donny and Marty are then supposed to attack Bobby when they hear Heather's signal. Lisa, Derek, and the hitman are waiting nearby to make sure Bobby does not escape. After the plan is set, Heather goes up to Ali and Bobby, and nervously asks about alligators in the canal. Bobby sarcastically tells her to go skinny-dipping to find out. After Heather mentions alligators again, Donny runs up behind Bobby and stabs him in the back of the neck. Shocked by the realness of the violence, Ali, Heather, and Derek run back to Ali's car, with Heather panicking in the backseat. When Bobby calls to Marty for help, Marty responds by running up and stabbing him in the abdomen. Bobby pleads with Marty, begging him for forgiveness shortly before Donny stabs him multiple times. Bobby tries to escape, but falls in front of Ali's car, where Marty finishes him by slitting his throat, followed by the hitman bludgeoning him with a baseball bat. Lisa witnesses it all, shocked but never turning away. Finally, the hitman drags Derek out of the car and demands his assistance in dumping the body in the swamp, to which he reluctantly agrees. They are shocked when Bobby flinches; they still decide to dump him in the canal, believing his wounds are fatal and that alligators will destroy any evidence. Ali, Heather, and Derek plan on going home, but the hitman stops them, stating they have to plan their alibi, and they drive to North Beach to talk it over. At the beach, Marty realizes he left his knife sheath at the canal, and the hitman states they have to go back anyway because they forgot to cover the tire marks on the sand. Marty, the hitman, and Ali go to retrieve the sheath, and while there they check up on the corpse, which is now being eaten by crabs. The three then rejoin the others at North Beach. The hitman says Marty will be the first suspect since he is Bobby's best friend. Everyone is aware that there are serious consequences for what they've done; however Lisa, Derek, Ali, and Heather do not believe they did anything wrong since they did not directly participate in Bobby's actual death. The hitman threatens to murder anyone who reports details of the crime to the police. Their commitment eventually unravels, however, as Derek and then Lisa reveal what they've done to others, while Ali phones in an anonymous tip, alerting the media to Bobby's death. Lisa calls Marty to tell him that people know Bobby is dead; he becomes upset and accuses Lisa of telling someone about what happened, although Lisa falsely insists she didn't. Lisa accuses Ali of ratting them out and tells her they have to hide, but Ali refuses. Lisa's mother overhears this conversation. The hitman then sees a news story about Bobby's death and realizes someone talked. Ali hides out in her house; due to her hysteria, her parents do not believe her when she says she's been involved in a murder. Lisa eventually calls the hitman and speaks to his younger brother, who says the hitman, whose real name is Derek Kaufman, is not a hitman at all. He tells Lisa that his brother has already been arrested for the murder, and suggests that Lisa and her friends turn themselves in. Eventually, all the teenagers do just that, with the exception of Marty. A few evenings later, police officers show up at Marty's home; he is asleep when they come into his room to arrest him. We later see the group in court wearing prison jumpsuits; Lisa is visibly pregnant by this time. When Heather asks if Lisa will even be let out to have the baby, an argument ensues and Marty reveals that his lawyer told him that Heather and Derek ratted them all out to lighten their sentences. When the hitman, knowing what Marty's talking about, begins to threaten Derek, Lisa tells him to back off. When Donny says he didn't do anything, Marty reminds him that he stabbed Bobby. Marty and Donny begin to argue, with the entire court taking notice as they inadvertently admit during the argument that they are responsible for Bobby's death. At the end of the film, subtitles show the prison sentences that the teenagers received: Donny, Lisa and the hitman  receive life sentences while Heather only got 7 years and Derek got 11 due to having problems with mental health, and Ali got 40 years while Marty is sentenced to death by the electric chair.rape florida striptease sadism conspiracy of murder bullying based on a true story murder homosexuality bully best friend falling in love group of friends teenage pregnancy",False,tt0242193,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1381824,0,0,-0.519730443240239,-0.8553948535632829,104280263.0,109280263.0,-3450689.0,5049311.0,-1569178.0,5430822.0,3261608.0,0,8761608.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8761608.0,3261608.0,0.0,1.0,121757219.71668534

At a company picnic, Bob is embarrassed in front of his self-absorbed boss Todd  by Cassie's militant friend Gretchen, who hurls a tub of disgusting slime over Todd. Looking forward to a big family vacation in Hawaii, Bob is punished by Todd by having to present a merger proposal to the grassroots Alpine Soda company in Boulder, Colorado instead. Concealing the real reason for going to Boulder, Bob rents an RV from the dodgy dealer Irv  and tells his family they are traveling to the Rockies. On their trip, Bob and his family encounter many mishaps. These include Bob damaging the parking brake, crashing into and running over objects such as shopping carts, flushing out a trio of raccoons with a stink bomb, and fixing a clogged sewage system. Along the way, the Munros meet another traveling family, the Gornickes, consisting of Travis , Mary Jo , and their sons and daughter, Earl , Billy ""Not Earl"" , and Moon . Earl develops a romantic interest in Cassie and Carl starts to like Moon, but thinking that the Gornickes are too strange for them, the adult Munros decide to ditch them; when the Gornickes reappear at another stop, the Munros believe they are stalking them. Meanwhile, to disguise his business trip, Bob tries to e-mail a proposal outline from his laptop, working in restrooms; eventually, a hitchhiker steals Bob's laptop, leaving him with only a BlackBerry PDA, which he does manage to use to compose and wirelessly send his proposal to his company. The Gornickes then recover the stolen laptop after picking up the same hitchhiker, and pursue the Munros to return it. Eventually the entire family begins to enjoy their vacation. In order to attend the merger meeting, though, Bob distracts his family by feigning illness and sends them on a hike. The meeting with Alpine Soda is a success, but Bob is invited to talk to the whole company again the next day. Rushing back to his family in the RV, Bob takes a treacherous 4 wheel drive trail, and gets the huge vehicle stuck atop a jutting boulder in the middle of the trail. . Bob eventually manages to dislodge the RV from the boulder by getting on the front of the RV and rocking it until it eventually wobbles and tips forward enough to slide down from atop the stone. Now riding on the front of the RV while it is traveling at a frenzied pace, Bob barely manages to return to his family in time, succeeding in fooling them, but while he is attempting a similar ruse the next day, the RV brakes fail again and it rolls into a lake. Bob lets it slip about the real intentions of the Colorado vacation, and his family is upset that he would use them like that. Still needing to get to the meeting, a desperate Bob retrieves one of his family's bicycles from the lake and pedals off. Jamie, Carl, and Cassie are then picked up by the Gornickes, and soon realize how well they get along, when Bob appears again, climbing atop the moving bus. After apologizing to his family, Bob is just about to blow off the meeting when it turns out he's right outside the headquarters. At the second meeting, Bob starts his speech and it goes well, but then -- Bob has an epiphany, and so he recommends against the merger, realizing that Todd's selfishness would destroy a great independent company. Carl gets angry at Todd and flips him over his shoulder, onto the ground. Moon exclaims ""My Hero!"" Bob is then fired but he quits anyway, and soon retrieves the sodden-but-still-operable RV from the lake. At the end, Bob is offered a job by the owners of Alpine Soda, who want to go national independently. As the credits roll, the two families are shown dancing and singing the song, ""Route 66"" .parent child relationship workaholic camping colorado rocky mountains marriage slapstick car crash family vacation family holiday recreational vehicle",False,tt0449089,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,87528173,0,0,0.75056346,-3.847336948521819,,,35492018.76190476,54449161.61904762,,,-41625938.0,4,8374062.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,157144647.0,10.0,187644647.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,52459967.0,142459967.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,98009354.5,57759354.5,1.75,1.5,92887866.92008553

After embezzling from his new employer's payroll , Gorman is brought to the attention of the CEO, Ross Webster . Webster is obsessed with the computer's potential to aid him in his schemes to rule the world financially. Joined by his sister Vera  and his ""psychic nutritionist"" Lorelei Ambrosia , Webster blackmails Gorman into helping him. Meanwhile, Clark Kent  has convinced his Daily Planet newspaper boss to allow him to return to Smallville for his high school reunion. En route, as Superman, he extinguishes a fire in a chemical plant containing vials of highly-unstable Beltric acid that can produce clouds of corrosive vapor when superheated. Clark is reunited with childhood friend Lana Lang . Lana is a divorcée with a young son named Ricky . Clark and Lana begin to share affection, though Lana's former boyfriend Brad , Clark's childhood bully and now an alcoholic security guard, is still vying for her attention. Webster schemes to monopolize the world's coffee crop. Infuriated by Colombia's refusal to do business with him, he orders Gorman to command an American weather satellite named Vulcan to create a tornadic storm to decimate the nation's coffee crop. Webster's scheme is thwarted when Superman neutralizes the tornado and saves the harvest. Webster then orders Gorman to use his computer knowledge to create Kryptonite, remembering Lois Lane's Daily Planet interview from Superman, during which Superman identified it as his only weakness. Gus uses a computer to order Vulcan to locate Krypton's debris in outer space, but after the computer fails to analyze an ""unknown"" element in kryptonite, he improvises by replacing the unidentified element with tar, garnered from a pack of cigarettes. Lana convinces Superman to appear at Ricky's birthday party, but Smallville turns it into a town celebration. Gus and Vera, disguised as United States Army officers, give Superman the Kryptonite as a gift, but are dismayed to see that it appears to have no effect on him. However, the compound gradually produces symptoms. Superman goes through a descent into darkness as he becomes selfish, focusing on his lust for Lana, which causes him to delay rescuing a truck driver from his jackknifed rig. Superman begins to question his own self-worth. He becomes depressed, angry, and casually destructive, committing petty acts of vandalism such as blowing out the Olympic Flame, straightening the Leaning Tower of Pisa and ripping open the hull of an oil tanker, causing the contents to spill into the sea. Webster plots to control the world's oil supply, ordering Gorman to direct all tankers to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and have them sit idly until further notice. Gorman feels unappreciated. He gives Webster a series of crudely drawn blueprints for a supercomputer. Ross makes a deal with Gorman, agreeing to build his supercomputer in return for sorting out the oil tankers. Lorelei is able to seduce Superman into disabling one ship and creating a giant oil spill. Superman goes on a drinking binge, but is eventually overcome by guilt and undergoes a nervous breakdown after Ricky calls out to him, urging him to fight against his descent into evil. After nearly crash-landing in a junkyard, Superman splits into two personas: the immoral, selfish, corrupted Superman and the moral, righteous Clark Kent. They engage in an epic battle, with the evil Superman repeatedly trying to kill Clark by crushing him in industrial equipment. The battle ends when Clark bursts through the walls of a car crusher and strangles his evil identity, vanquishing him for good. As a battered but unbowed Clark gazes up at the heavens, he pulls his shirt open to reveal his crest. Restored to his normal heroic self, Superman sets off to repair the damage his evil counterpart had caused. After defending himself from numerous rockets and an MX missile en route to the Grand Canyon and the villains' hideout, Superman confronts Webster, Vera and Lorelei for a final showdown. He is forced into a battle with Gorman's supercomputer, which severely weakens him with a beam of pure Kryptonite. Gorman, guilt-ridden and horrified by the prospect of ""going down in history as the man who killed Superman,"" destroys the Kryptonite ray with a firefighter's axe, whereupon Superman flees. The computer becomes self-aware and begins to defend itself against Gus's attempts to disable it, draining power from electrical towers, causing massive blackouts. Ross and Lorelei escape from the control room, but Vera is pulled into the computer and forcibly transformed into a cyborg. Empowered by the supercomputer, Vera attacks her brother and Lorelei with beams of energy that immobilize them. Superman returns to the battle with a canister of the Beltric acid from the chemical plant he saved earlier; the intense heat emitted by the machine causes the acid to turn volatile, eventually destroying the supercomputer. Superman flies away with Gus, leaving Webster and his cronies to deal with the authorities. After dropping Gus off at a West Virginia coal mine, where he gives him a job reference, Superman returns to Metropolis and brings a diamond ring to Lana Lang, who has relocated to the big city and found employment as the new secretary of Perry White . A surprised Lois Lane  looks on jealously. Superman then flies into the sunrise for further adventures.

Emilio El Zapa , a Colombian drug dealer, is shot to death in a telephone booth. As the killers leave, one of them drops a newspaper headline which announces Frank's release. Across town, Zapa's partner, King Tito  is in a hotel room with Jimmy Jump  and Test Tube , who are negotiating the purchase of cocaine. Jimmy and Test Tube shoot Tito and his bodyguards and steal the cocaine. Later, in a suite at the Plaza Hotel, Frank is greeted by Jimmy, Test Tube, and other members of his gang, who welcome him home with champagne and a briefcase full of money. Frank leaves to meet two of his lawyers, Joey Dalesio  and Jennifer , for dinner. Frank expresses his desire to be mayor and asks Dalesio to set up a meeting with Mafia boss Arty Clay . He and Jennifer leave to take a ride on the subway. Confronted by three muggers, Frank first brandishes his gun then gives them a wad of money, telling them to ask for him at the Plaza Hotel if they want work. Dalesio goes to Little Italy, to set up a meeting with Clay but the mafia don urinates on Dalesio's shoes and tells him it is a message for his boss. On hearing this, Frank, Jump and other members of the gang go to Clay's social club, where Frank tells Clay that he wants a percentage of all Clay's profits. When Clay insults him, Frank shoots the mafioso. As he leaves, Frank tells Clay's men that they can all find employment at the Plaza. The next night, Frank is confronted by Detectives Roy Bishop , Dennis Gilley , and Thomas Flanigan , of the NYPD narcotics squad, who say they are taking him in. Instead, they drive him to an empty lot where they show him the body of Emilio El Zapa in the trunk. When Frank refuses to confess, Gilley and Flanigan beat him and leave him in the lot. Frank sends Dalesio to Chinatown to make contact with Larry Wong , a local Triad leader who has 15 million worth of cocaine. Larry is leery, and demands that they meet alone on neutral ground to discuss the deal. Larry demands 3 million up front and another 500,000 after the drugs are sold. Frank counters that the two should team up, then split the profits evenly. Larry turns him down and demands that Frank decide immediately whether he wants to buy the drugs. Frank declines. Jimmy Jump and several of Frank's lieutenants are arrested by Gilley and Flanigan, who reveal that one of Tito's bodyguards is alive and willing to testify. When Frank learns of his men's arrest, he orders his lawyers to arrange their release, and sends a limousine to pick them up. They head to Chinatown, where they kill Larry and his gang. They find the cocaine in the basement. Gilley, Flanigan and other officers resolve to use illegal means to get rid of Frank. Posing as drug dealers, they bribe Dalesio into leading them to the nightclub where Frank and his men are partying. The cops burst in shooting, slaying several members of Frank's gang. Fleeing over the Queensboro Bridge, Frank and Jump trade shots with the police, killing all but Gilley and Flanigan. After evading their pursuers, the two men split up. Jump shoots Flanigan in the chest, puncturing his ballistic vest. Gilley kills Jump with a single shot to the head. A few days later at Flanigan's funeral, Frank kills Gilley. That night, after his men kill Dalesio, Frank goes to Bishop's apartment, telling him that he has placed a 250,000 bounty on every detective involved in the case. Holding Bishop at gunpoint, Frank explains that he killed Tito, Larry, Arty Clay, and Zapa because he disapproved of their businesses, including human trafficking and child prostitution. Before he leaves, Frank forces Bishop to handcuff himself to a chair. As Frank heads to the subway, Bishop uses a hidden gun to free himself. Following Frank into a subway car, Bishop corners him. Frank shoots Bishop, killing him, but the policeman is able to fire a last shot. In a taxi in Times Square, Frank realizes that he has been hit.

The brothers are being driven out of business by the mafia-like Scapelli Construction Company, led by contractor Anthony Scapelli. Mario is the elder of the two brothers, being close to his late 30's, and Luigi is in his mid 20's. Luigi falls in love with an orphaned NYU student, Daisy, who is digging under the Brooklyn Bridge for dinosaur bones. After a date, she takes Luigi to the dig and witnesses Scapelli's men  sabotage it by leaving the water-pipes open. Luigi tries to stop it but he does not have his tools on him so he cannot fix it. They rush back to his apartment where they inform Mario about the incident. The three go back to the flooding and the brothers manage to fix it but are knocked out by two strange characters, Iggy and Spike, who proceed to kidnap Daisy. Mario and Luigi awaken a minute later and head deeper into the caves following Daisy's screams and discover an interdimensional portal through which Mario and Luigi follow Daisy. They find themselves in a strange dystopian parallel world where a human-like race evolved from dinosaurs rather than the mammalian ancestry of true humans. Sixty-five million years ago, a meteorite crashed into the Earth and in doing so ripped the universe into two parallel dimensions. All the surviving dinosaurs of the time crossed over into this new realm. Iggy and Spike turn out to be henchmen  of the other world's germophobic and obsessive dictator, King Koopa, descended from the T-Rex. However, the two have failed to also bring Daisy's rock, a meteorite fragment which Koopa is trying to get in order to merge his world with the real world that separated from Koopa's world during the meteor strike. It turns out that Daisy is the Princess of the other dimension but when Koopa overthrew Daisy's father , Daisy's mother took her to New York using the inter-dimensional portal. The portal was then destroyed, killing Daisy's mother in the process, but when Scapelli was blasting at the cave, the portal was reopened. When Koopa hears about the re-opening of the portal, he sends Spike and Iggy to find Daisy and the rock to merge the dimensions and make Koopa dictator of both worlds. Spike and Iggy, however, who had grown more intelligent after being subjected to one of Koopa's experiments, decide to turn on Koopa and join forces with Mario and Luigi. Koopa thinks only Daisy can merge the worlds, but Mario and Luigi were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Daisy is eventually rescued by the plumbers. Eventually, the two worlds merge and Koopa inadvertently devolves Scapelli into a primate while aiming for Mario, but Luigi and Daisy take back the rock and the worlds separate again. Mario confronts Koopa and eventually wins when he and Luigi devolve him, transforming him into a ferocious, semi-humanoid Tyrannosaurus. Koopa then leaps out for a final attack but Mario and Luigi destroy him by devolving him into primeval slime. Daisy's father turns back to normal and reclaims control over the kingdom stating he loves those plumbers. The citizens destroy anything involving Koopa. As the brothers return home, Luigi and Daisy admit their love for one another but Daisy cannot return to New York until the damage caused by Koopa is reversed and she spends more time with her father. Mario rephrases Daisy's words to Luigi but he does not care. A deeply hurt and saddened Luigi kisses her goodbye and the two brothers return to New York, while Daisy watches them leave. About three weeks later, Daisy returns for Mario and Luigi's help in fighting more villains. Meanwhile, Mario and Luigi's story is televised, giving them the name; ""Super Mario Bros"". In a post-credits scene, two Nintendo executives talk about a video game based on their adventures but they are asking Iggy and Spike instead of the Super Mario Bros. and they decide on a title called ""The Super Koopa Cousins"".saving the world sibling relationship plumber royalty dinosaur based on video game woman director multiple dimensions",False,tt0108255,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,20915465,0,0,-1.294952562613358,-19.533412250327295,,,,,-25431478.0,11383522.0,203013.33333333334,11,11203013.333333334,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-12316079.0,14683921.0,1.0,,,,71971200.0,78371200.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,402208848.0,424208848.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,11203013.333333334,203013.33333333334,1.375,3.0,41299258.6989175

Zaltar  allows Kara to see a unique and immensely powerful item known as the Omegahedron, which he has borrowed without the knowledge of the city government, and which powers the city. However, after a mishap, the Omegahedron is blown out into space. Much to the distress of her parents , Kara follows it to Earth  in an effort to recover it and save the city. On Earth, the Omegahedron is recovered by Selena , a power-hungry would-be witch assisted by the feckless Bianca  and seeking to free herself from her relationship with warlock Nigel . Whilst not knowing exactly what it is, Selena quickly realizes that the Omegahedron is powerful and can enable her to perform real magical spells. Supergirl arrives on Earth and discovers her powers. Following the path of the Omegahedron, she takes the name Linda Lee, identifies herself as a cousin of Clark Kent, and enrolls at an all-girls school where she befriends Lucy Lane , a younger sister of Lois Lane who happens to be studying there. Supergirl also meets and becomes enamoured with Ethan  who works as a groundskeeper at the school. Ethan also catches the eye of Selena, who drugs him with a love potion, however Ethan regains consciousness in Selena's absence and wanders out into the streets. An angry Selena uses her new-found powers to animate a construction vehicle, which she sends to bring Ethan back, causing chaos in the streets as it does so. Supergirl rescues Ethan and he falls in love with her instead while in guise of Linda Lee. Supergirl and Selena repeatedly battle in various ways, until Selena uses her powers to put Supergirl in an ""eternal void"" known as the Phantom Zone. Here, stripped of her powers, she wanders the bleak landscape and nearly drowns in an oily bog. Yet she finds help in Zaltar, who has exiled himself to the Phantom Zone as a punishment for losing the Omegahedron. Zaltar sacrifices his life to allow Supergirl to escape. Back on Earth, Selena misuses the Omegahedron to make herself a ""princess of Earth"", with Ethan as her lover and consort. Emerging from the Phantom Zone, Supergirl regains her powers and defeats Selena. Free from Selena's spell, Ethan admits his love for Linda and that he knows that she and Supergirl are one and the same, but knows it is possible he may never see her again and understands she must save Argo City. The final scene shows Kara returning the Omegahedron to a darkened Argo City, which promptly lights up again.dc comics magic laser power superhero based on comic alternate dimension teenage girl gardener occult heroine love potion all girls school invisible monster",False,tt0088206,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,14296438,0,0,-1.4481622625160198,3.9275459302257203,,,,,,,,0,,,-7410692.0,1.0,589308.0,1.0,54995385.0,22.0,69995385.0,1.0,,0.0,,,6640084.0,6.0,14560084.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,40107344.0,50557344.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,190838362.0,245338362.0,2.0,139509116.0,188842449.33333334,3.0,,,,,,,6640084.0,14560084.0,1.0,160000000.0,187500000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,25577001.0,40577001.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,81017853.5,115517853.5,2.0,,,,112059262.33333333,131392595.66666667,3.0,,,,,,,,,28381592.333333332,18074925.666666668,3.625,1.0,48770840.0372125

Bridger meets with planner Charlie Croker and the rest of their team: Steve, the ""inside man""; Handsome Rob, their driver; ""Left Ear"", their explosives expert; and Lyle, their technology expert. They successfully recover a safe filled with gold, but Steve betrays the group not long thereafter, killing John and attempting but failing to kill the rest of the team. A year later, Charlie and the team have located Steve with the help of an informant. Steve, having taken a new identity and moved to a mansion in Los Angeles, is attempting to launder the gold through a jewelry store owner, Yevhen. To execute a plan to recover the gold before it can be moved, Charlie contacts Stella, now a professional safe-cracker for law enforcement, and convinces her to help them. Charlie's initial plan is to distract Steve by having Stella, posing as a cable technician, go on a date with Steve while they drive through his home in three Mini Coopers, modified by Rob's mechanic friend Wrench to handle the weight of the gold, then make their escape through Los Angeles using hacked traffic lights to cover their route. Charlie calls off the plan when they find the next-door neighbors are having a party that night, but has Stella go on the date with Steve to avoid attracting attention. Regardless, Steve identifies Stella's true identity. Charlie confronts Steve directly, warning that they will find some way to recover the gold and make up for John's death. Steve is forced to accelerate the sale of gold to Yevhen, but Yevhen reveals that he knew of the Venice heist, and Steve kills Yevhen to keep him silent, unaware that Yevhen is the cousin of the local Ukrainian crime boss Maskhov. Steve arranges to move the gold. Charlie's team realizes that Steve, watching from a helicopter above, has enlisted three armored trucks, two to act as decoys. With Lyle's help, they determine which truck holds the gold and use the traffic lights to manipulate the truck to a designated spot. There, they detonate explosives under the street, dropping the truck into an empty subway tunnel. Charlie and his team load the gold into the Mini Coopers and evade Steve's security team. Steve hijacks a truck and follows the cars to a train station, where they appear to have been loaded onto a boxcar. Steve opens the boxcar to find only Charlie waiting for him. Steve tries to fire on Charlie, but he is captured by Maskhov's men; Charlie reveals that he told Maskhov about how Steve stole the gold and killed Yevhen; Maskhov accepts a share of the gold and takes Steve with him. Charlie and the rest of the team split up the remaining gold and go their separate ways, with Charlie and Stella staying together.venice, italy california helicopter parent child relationship austria mountain gold subway hacker chase safe remake caper revenge murder heist double crossed boat chase los angeles, california explosion convict car chase tv news hollywood sign television repair mini cooper",False,tt0317740,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,176070171,1,0,1.93450285,-14.415123713336484,,,94195413.23076923,110283720.92307693,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,-41625938.0,1.0,8374062.0,1.0,50282030.0,5.0,55957030.0,2.0,-2357142.0,19.0,5142858.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-27641426.0,18.0,358574.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-26043392.0,33956608.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,46846632.85714286,63459204.28571428,7.0,,,,,,,851475550.0,976475550.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17458131.0,-5335619.0,5.375,1.25,79569518.43496008

Souza notices her grandson is sad and lonely so she buys him a puppy named Bruno to cheer him up. Although he is initially happy, he quickly becomes melancholic once again. After discovering that Champion has a keen interest in road bicycle racing, because it is implied that Champion's deceased parents were bicyclists, she buys him a tricycle. Years later, Champion becomes a professional cyclist with Souza as his coach. Eventually, Champion enters the Tour de France but during the race, he and two other riders are kidnapped by two French mafia henchmen and brought to a bustling metropolis in North America. Souza and Bruno follow the men, but lose their trail soon after reaching the city. Lost and with no way to find Champion, Souza has a chance encounter with the renowned Belleville triplets, music hall singers from the 1930s, now elderly women turned improvisational musicians. The sisters take Souza to their home and over time she becomes a part of their group. Meanwhile, the mafia boss drugs the kidnapped cyclists and employs a mechanic to build a stationary cycling machine for the racers to race on — to create their own mini Tour de France for gambling. At a fancy restaurant, the Triplets plus Souza perform a jam session using a newspaper, refrigerator, vacuum and bicycle wheel. The mafia boss who kidnapped her grandson happens to be in the same restaurant and, with the help of Bruno, Souza realizes he has Champion. She tails one of the Mafia's minions the next day and discovers their scheme. That night, several mob bosses and their henchmen arrive at the mafia hideout and place bets on the riders . Madame Souza, Bruno and the triplets then infiltrate the hideout and sabotage the contraption, unbolting it from the ground and turning it into a pedal-powered vehicle on which they all escape. The mob henchmen pursue them, but are all thwarted amidst the chase.

One of them, Blaine Rawlings  faced with the foreclosure of his family ranch in Texas, decides to enlist after seeing a newsreel of aerial combat in France. Dilettante Briggs Lowry  joins because of his overbearing father. African-American boxer Eugene Skinner , who had been accepted as an athlete in France, was motivated to ""pay back"" his adopted country. These American recruits were under the command of French Captain Georges Thenault , while the veteran fighter ace Reed Cassidy , a fellow American, takes over as their mentor. During their training, each pilot struggles with the demanding flying; later, they have to face the aerial dogfights that dominate the front line missions. Rawlings meets a young woman named Lucienne whom he courts despite her hesitations about his risky profession. The hero is given a small bear, which he carries as a good luck charm, possibly a reference to the small bear carried as a good luck charm by a pilot in ""Wings,"" a silent film about World War I American Pilots, which, in 1927, was the first film ever to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. On their first mission to escort two bombers to attack a German ammunition depot, the rookie pilots are ambushed by Germans and two are killed while flying; another pilot is forced to make an emergency landing. While on the ground this American pilot is shot and killed by the German ace The Black Falcon who returns to altitude and is met by the more chivalrous German pilot Franz Wolferd who shakes his head in disapproval. During an attack on a German Zeppelin, Reed Cassidy is mortally wounded by the Black Falcon but, as his final act, destroys the Zeppelin by crashing into it. Rawlings reunites with Lucienne before she leaves for Paris. Before Rawlings leaves for another battle, his plane is presented with an eagle, Cassidy's former insignia, and Rawlings is promoted to Commander. Their next mission is to escort four bombers which are being sent to bomb the same supply depot from the first mission. During the battle Franz Wolferd is shot down as well as a few of the American pilots, including Briggs Lowry, who shoots himself with his sidearm rather than be burned alive in his stricken plane. Nevertheless, the mission is a success and the German supply depot is bombed. Upon returning from the bombing mission, Rawlings takes off again to exact revenge on the Black Falcon, followed soon after by the rest of the Lafayette Escadrille. A melee between Rawlings and his American pilots and the Black Falcon and his German squadron ensues. During the final battle, despite having jammed guns and being wounded, Rawlings evades his enemy and fatally shoots the Black Falcon with his pistol.

When questioned by the police, she calmly reveals that the two dismembered bodies inside are of her unfaithful husband and his mistress. She is then sentenced by the judge ([[Roger Hammond  to a secure unit for the criminally insane for manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Forty-three years later, in the village of Little Wallop, Walter Goodfellow, the vicar  is very busy writing the perfect sermon for a conference, having no idea about the problems in his house, which include the unfulfilled sexual needs of his wife Gloria  who subsequently starts an affair with her golf instructor, Lance ; the rebellious nature of his daughter Holly  who constantly picks up new boyfriends; and son Petey  who is bullied by schoolmates. Then everything changes with the arrival of the new housekeeper Grace . Walter and Gloria first meet her when they fail to fetch Petey from school and see him strolling with her. Gloria becomes very angry, thinking that Grace is trying to kidnap him and is appeased only when the latter identifies herself by showing an envelope with her name on it. Grace is installed into their lives and learns about some of the problems in the house – neighbour Mr Brown's nuisance-barking Jack Russell terrier, Clarence, who consistantly disturbs Gloria's sleep; the bullying of Petey; and Gloria and Lance's affair. Walter does not know anything about any of these – the only problem he has is the toxic blue-green algae in the garden pond. Grace resolves to solve these problems in her own way. She first kills Clarence the Jack Russell, and when his owner finds out that his dog has been killed, she kills him, too. She sabotages the bullies' bicycles, injuring one of them and thereby making Petey very happy. She catches the golf instructor outside the house one night, videotaping Holly undressing, and kills him with an iron. While Walter is preparing his sermon for the conference, Grace introduces him to having a sense of humour to his religion and also teaching him that he can still love his wife as well as God by insinuating the sexual references in the Song of Solomon. As the problems in the household seem to be gradually clearing, Walter leaves for an Ecclesiastical convention. However, Grace is discovered when Gloria and Holly see her picture on the television in a news item mentioning her release and previous offences. It is then that Grace reveals that she is Gloria's long-lost mother, Rosie Jones, explaining why she came to Little Wallop in the first place{{explain}}. Gloria attempts to teach Grace that when having a problem with someone, one cannot just kill them but is baffled when Grace says that that is the one thing she and her doctors could never agree on, implying that Grace's condition is beyond treatment . Despite their disagreements, Gloria tries to help Grace remove Lance's body, but cannot face up to it. Over a cup of tea, the three women decide not to tell Walter or Peter any of what has happened. But all is not over. When nagging congregant Mrs Parker  comes over to discuss the problem of the church flower arranging committee, Grace, under the impression that Mrs Parker is about to turn them in, attempts to hit her over the head with a frying pan, but is prevented by Gloria. Mrs Parker, shocked by the murder attempt, has a heart attack and dies. Walter, having just returned from the convention and unaware that she is already dead mutters: ""Oh, that flower arranging committee. It'll be the death of her."" Soon after this, Grace leaves the family when order seems to be restored among them. At the end of the film, Walter is talking to Bob and Ted, the water works employees, about the pond at the Vicar's house. They say that there is too much algae and the pond needs to be drained. Gloria knows that Grace disposed of her victims in the pond. Gloria, with a disturbingly cheerful expression, offers the two men some tea, the film closes with an underwater shot depicting the bodies of Bob and Ted in the pond.golf planned murder killer housekeeper extramarital affair family conflict",False,tt0444653,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,18564702,0,0,108.8503076923077,-2.6760407675788414,13574082.666666666,44690749.333333336,,,,,186242484.66666666,8,218909151.33333334,3.0,102698688.0,13.0,116098688.0,5.0,188279427.0,20.0,222079427.0,5.0,-14682495.5,13.0,13817504.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,79640573.0,16.0,96640573.0,2.0,85072577.0,3.0,120072577.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,81196419.0,91196419.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,131269653.47222222,104541875.69444445,9.125,3.0,109858494.28372188

For years the United Kingdom, one of the few stable nations with a functioning government, has been deluged by asylum seekers from around the world, fleeing the chaos and war which has taken hold in most countries. In response Britain has become a militarised police state as British forces round up and detain immigrants. Kidnapped by an immigrants rights group known as ""The Fishes"", former activist turned cynical bureaucrat Theo Faron  is brought to its leader, his estranged American wife Julian Taylor . They separated after their son died from a flu pandemic in 2008. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee , which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel , a government minister. However, the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a larger sum. Luke , a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam  towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang and Julian is fatally shot. Luke kills two police officers who stop their car and they escape to a safe house. Kee reveals her importance to Theo: she is pregnant. Julian had told her to only trust him, intending to hand Kee to the ""Human Project"", a supposed scientific group in the Azores dedicated to curing infertility. However, Luke persuades Kee to stay. That night, Theo eavesdrops on a meeting of Luke and other members and discovers that Julian's death was orchestrated so the group could use the baby as a political tool to support the coming revolution. Theo wakes Kee and Miriam and they steal a car, escaping to the secluded hideaway of Theo's aging hippie friend Jasper Palmer , a former editorial cartoonist. A plan is formulated to board the Human Project ship Tomorrow which will arrive offshore from the Bexhill refugee camp and Jasper proposes getting Syd , a camp guard he knows, to smuggle them in. The Fishes trail the group and Jasper stays behind to stall them, giving the government-issued suicide drug Quietus to his catatonic wife. A horrified Theo witnesses the Fishes kill him before escaping with Miriam and Kee. Later they meet Syd, who transports them to Bexhill as prisoners. When Kee begins having contractions on a bus, Miriam distracts a suspicious guard with mania and is taken away. That night Kee gives birth. The next day Syd informs Theo and Kee that a war between the army and the refugees, including the Fishes, has begun. After seeing the baby Syd threatens to turn them in but they attack him and escape. Amidst the fighting between refugees and British troops, the Fishes capture Kee. Theo tracks her and her baby to an apartment which is under heavy fire from the military and escorts her out. Awed by the presence of a baby, the combatants stop fighting momentarily, enabling them to escape. Marichka leads them to a boat in a sewer, but refuses to join them. Theo rows away, revealing to Kee that he had been shot during the gunfire. As they witness the aerial bombing of Bexhill by the Royal Air Force, Kee tells Theo she will name her baby Dylan after Theo's son. Theo loses consciousness and Kee begins to sing a lullaby as the Tomorrow approaches through the fog.police state england hippie rebel refugee camp miracle future dystopia chaos aging childlessness faith survival violence birth dying",False,tt0206634,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,69959751,1,0,-0.08633891507132438,-3.847336948521819,74048722.1764706,109681075.11764705,,,,,62333659.0,5,116266992.33333333,3.0,,0.0,,,40226974.333333336,42.0,77226974.33333333,6.0,58052201.6,8.0,91452201.6,5.0,-49867.0,1.0,9950133.0,1.0,-8437200.0,4.0,1562800.0,1.0,-41625938.0,4.0,8374062.0,1.0,18372788.0,2.0,34039454.666666664,3.0,,,,,,,612408834.5,767408834.5,2.0,,,,-13575237.5,16924762.5,2.0,565013115.0,745013115.0,1.0,659804554.0,789804554.0,1.0,36505432.0,42005432.0,2.0,713853.75,25463853.75,8.0,,,,12298192.0,167298192.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,95564739.0,150564739.0,2.0,204931766.0,244931766.0,1.0,88790683.0,188290683.0,2.0,,,,-2389127.0,27610873.0,1.0,59195834.28571428,83725196.85714285,7.0,145134417.2,233534417.2,5.0,-11044402.0,38955598.0,1.0,204931766.0,244931766.0,1.0,,,,,,,209377551.33333334,286544218.0,6.0,,,48410373.99047619,18410373.99047619,8.25,2.857142857142857,92887866.92008553

It begins shortly before the coronation of Romulus Augustulus as Emperor in 460. Having traveled through much of the known world in search of Caesar's sword, Ambrosinus has then become Romulus's tutor. A Druid and part of a secret brotherhood protecting the sword, he at times gives the impression he is a magician, but his ""magic"" is usually revealed to be simple trickery. One of the running concepts of the movie surrounds the question of whether or not Ambrosinus has any actual magical abilities or simply an illusionist. Romulus's father Orestes rules Rome but is not Emperor himself. On the day before the coronation, Odoacer, commander of the barbarian Goths allied with Rome, demands a third of Italy from Orestes, but is rebuffed. The same day, Romulus meets the general of the Nova Invicta Legion, Aurelianus Caius Antonius, called ""Aurelius"". The night after Romulus is crowned, Rome is attacked by the Goths. Most of Aurelius's men, pledged to protect the emperor, are killed, though Aurelius is only stunned and left for dead. Orestes and his wife are killed by Odoacer's lieutenant Wulfila, who captures Romulus. Next day, Odoacer, now ruler of the Western Empire, plans to have Romulus killed. However, Ambrosinus convinces Odoacer to spare the boy. Instead, Romulus is exiled to Capri along with Ambrosinus, guarded by Wulfila and his men. His prison is a villa constructed more than four centuries earlier by the emperor Tiberius. With Ambrosinus's help, Romulus discovers a hidden chamber within the villa. He comes across a statue of Caesar holding the fabled sword, forged by a Chalybian smith after his military campaigns in Britain. Writing near the statue's feet proclaims the sword was made for ""he who is destined to rule"". This is interpreted as a prophecy by various characters, and Romulus keeps the weapon. The two are rescued from Capri by the loyal Aurelius and three surviving legionaries, Vatrenus, Batiatus, and Demetrius, accompanied by a female agent of the Eastern Roman Empire - a Keralite warrior named Mira . They take Romulus to a seaport where the Eastern Roman Empire's emissary  and the senator Nestor have promised safe passage to Constantinople. However, they barely escape after they learn the Senate and the Eastern Empire have betrayed them and sided with Odoacer. Ambrosinus persuades Romulus to seek refuge in Britain, where the Ninth Legion  may remain loyal, being far from the events. They are followed by Wulfila and his men; the Goth covets Caesar's sword after learning the prophecy. Crossing the Alps and the English Channel, the party travels to Hadrian's Wall and initially find no evidence of the legion until a farmer approaches and reveals he was its commander. With the collapse of Roman support of Britain, the legion had decided to disband and settle as farmers. Most of the men in the legion had married and had families. They also did not want to antagonize the powerful warlord Vortgyn. During their stay in the small Celtic village, Romulus meets and befriends a young girl named Igraine. Aurelius and Mira practice swordfighting and become close to each other. Ambrosinus told Romulus of a scar on his chest, similar to the design on the sword hilt, which he received from Vortgyn after he refused to tell him where the sword of Caesar was. Vortgyn also desires the sword of Caesar as he aspires to rule the whole of Britain. It is revealed that Vortgyn and Ambrosinus are old enemies. After meeting with the Goths, Vortgyn decides to either capture or kill Romulus as a gesture to Odoacer. After confronting Igraine outside of the village, he convinces her to tell everyone in the village to surrender Romulus and has several of his men kill the blacksmith's wife and sons. When a tearful Igraine tells the villagers of what has happened, Aurelius confesses that Romulus is the emperor of Rome. The blacksmith then demands revenge on his wife's and sons' deaths, and Aurelius and his men decide to lead an army to Hadrian's Wall to face Vortgyn's armies in one final battle. Before leaving the village, Romulus receives from Igraine a suit of Roman armor which belonged to her brother, which he has since outgrown. Aurelius, wielding Caesar's sword, leads his men and a small number of Celtic warriors against Vortgyn's forces at Hadrian's Wall. Aurelius, his men, and the archers pelted the infantry with arrows, while Mira, Romulus, and several Roman and Celtic soldiers struggled to hold the enemy at the gate. Despite their casualties, Vortgyn's soldiers began to slowly overwhelm the small force on the wall. The battle appears hopeless until the rest of the Ninth Legion, having taken up their old Roman arms and uniforms, appear and turn the tide. The two warring sides cease their hostilities when Ambrosinus confronts and burns Vortgyn alive at a tree-sanctuary of his secret brotherhood near the battlefield. Romulus kills Wulfila with Caesar's sword, avenging his parents. He tells Aurelius that he fought like a dragon, whereupon Aurelius replies that Romulus fought like the son of a dragon. Repulsed by the deaths in the battle, Romulus heaves away his sword which remarkably pierces a large rock and becomes lodged there. Many years later, Ambrosinus, now known by his Druid name, Merlin, takes a young boy to the battlefield to describe the now legendary events. Merlin, who has visibly aged little since the battle, says that Aurelius married Mira and the two raised Romulus as their own son. He became a wise ruler, took the girl Igraine as his wife, and adopted the name ""Pendragon"". The boy, Arthur, recognizes Romulus as his father and Igraine as his mother. In a final scene, the sword of Julius Caesar is shown embedded in the stone, with moss growing on the blade, covering the original inscription, leaving only the Latin letters which, when read as a single word, read Excalibur.roman empire emperor ancient rome western roman empire ancient world excalibur julius caesar britannia",True,tt0462396,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,25303038,0,0,-1.6479033861467545,-6.117028646878049,93491871.33333333,147491871.33333334,21975011.0,121975011.0,,,141385479.33333334,18,165052146.0,9.0,-6864082.0,25.0,29795918.0,5.0,,0.0,,,-1011095.0,11.0,6788905.0,3.0,22330482.0,11.0,49330482.0,2.0,150350416.0,13.0,156350416.0,2.0,,0.0,,,97489822.0,2.0,122489822.0,1.0,,,,171861933.625,220836933.625,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,88301281.5,67280170.3888889,10.0,3.6666666666666665,105980128.20199434

Starling and her connection to Hannibal Lecter  come to the attention of Lecter's only surviving victim, Mason Verger , a wealthy child molester whom Lecter left horribly disfigured and paralyzed after having been assigned as Verger's court-appointed therapist. Verger uses his immense wealth and political influence to have Starling reassigned to Lecter's case and meets with her in his mansion. Verger is pursuing an elaborate scheme to capture, torture and kill Lecter, and hopes Starling's involvement will draw him out. Indeed, Lecter sends her a taunting letter after learning of her public disgrace. Though the letter contains no clue to Lecter's whereabouts, Starling detects a strange fragrance that a perfume expert later identifies as a bespoke skin cream whose ingredients are only available to a few shops in the world. She contacts the police departments of the cities where the shops are located, requesting surveillance tapes. One of the cities is Florence, Italy, where Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi  is investigating the disappearance of a library curator. Pazzi questions Lecter, who is masquerading as ""Dr. Fell"", the assistant curator and now caretaker of the library. Upon recognizing Dr. Fell in the surveillance tape, Pazzi accesses the FBI's ViCAP database of wanted fugitives. He learns of Verger's US3 million reward to anyone turning Lecter over to him rather than to the FBI. Lured by Verger's bounty, Pazzi ignores Starling's warnings against trying to capture Lecter alone. He recruits a pickpocket to obtain a fingerprint of Lecter to show as proof of his whereabouts and thus collect the reward. The pickpocket is mortally wounded by Lecter, but manages to get the print and provides them to Pazzi, who in turn contacts Verger. Lecter then baits Pazzi into an isolated room of the library, ties him up with electrical cords, and hangs and disembowels him, before escaping back to the United States. Verger bribes Justice Department official Paul Krendler  to accuse Starling of withholding a note from Lecter, leading to her suspension. Lecter lures Starling to Union Station but Verger's men, who have followed Starling, capture Lecter and transport him to Verger. When her superiors refuse to act, Starling, on her own initiative, infiltrates Verger's estate. Verger means to have Lecter eaten alive by a herd of wild boars bred specifically for this purpose. Starling intervenes to free Lecter but is herself wounded, and Lecter rescues her from the voracious animals. Verger furiously orders his private physician Cordell  to shoot Lecter, but instead Lecter persuades Cordell to throw his hated employer into the pen, where he is eaten alive by the boars. Lecter takes a sedated Starling to Krendler's secluded lake house and treats her wounds. When Krendler arrives for the Fourth of July break, he is subdued and drugged by Lecter. Starling, disoriented by morphine and dressed in a slinky black velvet cocktail dress, wakes to find Lecter cooking and Krendler in a wheelchair seated at the table set for an elegant dinner. Weakened by the drugs, she looks on in confusion and horror as Lecter removes the top of Krendler's skull, cuts out part of his prefrontal cortex, sautees it and feeds Krendler his own brain before finally killing him. After the meal, Starling tries to attack Lecter but is quickly overpowered. She manages to handcuff his wrist to hers, and with police incoming to the residence, Lecter brandishes a meat cleaver and severs his left hand to escape. Lecter is later seen on a flight with boxed lunch on his pull-down table. As he prepares to eat his meal, including a small cooked portion of what is assumed to be Krendler's brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food. Lecter lets the boy eat some of his lunch, telling him that ""it is important... always to try new things.""venice, italy fbi brain serial killer aftercreditsstinger",False,tt0212985,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,351692268,0,0,3.042439862068965,-0.8553948535632829,-16386538.0,8613462.0,50134958.46666667,77701625.13333334,354640427.0,457640427.0,11180179.0,24,26763512.333333332,6.0,7850858.333333333,3.0,25184191.666666668,3.0,-197873.0,15.0,7968793.666666667,3.0,,0.0,,,-22508011.0,5.0,2491989.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,354640427.0,457640427.0,1.0,,,,179754685.0,245254685.0,2.0,,,,4868943.0,32868943.0,1.0,80926936.4,123626936.4,5.0,-39808601.0,7191399.0,1.0,157415913.0,232415913.0,2.0,,,,-39808601.0,7191399.0,1.0,,,,162249283.0,231249283.0,2.0,174022713.5,229022713.5,2.0,,,,,,,354640427.0,457640427.0,1.0,15692101.0,70692101.0,1.0,,,,-39808601.0,7191399.0,1.0,,,,152139521.0,205014521.0,4.0,354640427.0,457640427.0,1.0,354640427.0,457640427.0,1.0,354640427.0,457640427.0,1.0,,,,,,15602121.666666666,-918711.6666666667,5.875,3.25,121757219.71668534

Bridget  is ecstatic about her relationship with Mark Darcy . However, Bridget's confidence in her relationship is shattered when she meets Mark's colleague, the beautiful Rebecca Gilles . Bridget meets her ex, Daniel Cleaver , at her job for Sit-Up Britain and is offered a position as the ""Smooth Guidess"". Bridget is delighted to be asked by Mark to go to the ""Law Council Dinner"", assuming he will propose afterwards, but the night does not end well. After the ""Law Council Dinner"", Mark and Bridget have an argument and she walks away from him. Mark goes to Bridget's apartment, apologizes, and tells her he loves her for the first time. Later in the night, Mark asks Bridget if she'd like to go on a ski holiday. Once on the slopes, she learns Rebecca recommended the vacation spot to Mark. While on the holiday, Bridget thinks she's pregnant and after an argument concerning the future of children, the test is negative. After they return home, Bridget and Mark have lunch with both of their parents. When the subject of marriage comes up during conversation, Bridget is hurt by Mark's comment that it's not something they're even thinking about yet. At Mark's place, Bridget is upset at him for not giving a straight answer on his reasons and breaks off their relationship. Bridget decides to go with Daniel to Thailand to film ""The Smooth Guide"" with her friend, Shazzer . Bridget and Daniel flirt on the plane which leads to them alone in a hotel room, but she walks out after a prostitute arrives. While packing for the trip home from Thailand, Bridget puts Shazzer's gift from a man named Jed ([[Paul Nicholls  in her bag. Bridget is arrested and sent to a Thai prison after airport security dogs recognize cocaine inside the gift. In prison, Bridget spends her time sharing relationship stories with the inmates and teaching them Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"". Mark arrives to tell Bridget that his superiors have sent him to put her release in motion. Bridget identifies Jed on a picture as the man who gave Shazzer the hidden cocaine. Mark walks away after clearly stating that he was just the messenger. In Britain, Mark confronts Daniel for not helping Bridget when she was arrested, and they start a fight outside a museum. At Bridget's return, she is an international human rights celebrity. She is greeted by her parents who have been busy planning their vow renewal ceremony. At home, she is surprised by her friends who inform her that Mark was the one who tracked down Jed and forced him into custody in order to free her, in the process putting into motion the British Government, Mi5, Interpol & many other diplomatic big-wigs. Hopeful that he still loves her, she runs down to his house, but finds Rebecca there, who reveals that she does not love Mark, but loves Bridget instead. Bridget confronts Mark at his legal chambers and asks him to take her back. Mark proposes to Bridget and she accepts.

The four then leave for Newark International Airport. At the airport, the crew and passengers board United Airlines Flight 93. Shortly after boarding, and the safety briefing, Flight 93 is delayed for 41 minutes because of the high volume of traffic. The three other soon to be hijacked flights, American Airlines Flight 11, United Airlines Flight 175, and American Airlines Flight 77 take off at other airports. Air traffic controllers monitoring all current flights determine that American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767 from Boston's Logan International Airport has taken a turn toward New York City. Shortly after, Flight 11 crashes into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, although the air traffic controllers do not immediately realize what has happened. About 20 minutes earlier, a tape recording was made of Mohamed Atta's line ""We have some planes, just stay quiet and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport."" Meanwhile, United Airlines Flight 175, another Boeing 767, also from Boston, is also hijacked, and begins to descend and turn toward New York City as well. Air traffic controllers then realize they are dealing with multiple hijackings. American Airlines Flight 77, a Boeing 757 is also hijacked. The air traffic controllers and Air Force watch as Flight 175 crashes into the South Tower of the World Trade Center on live television, reported by CNN. United Airlines Flight 93 reaches its cruising altitude about the same time that Flight 175 crashes. The pilots of Flight 93 receive a message, Beware cockpit intrusion. Two a/c hit WTC. The terrorists on Flight 93 argue about when to begin their operation. At 9:28 AM, after Ahmed al-Haznawi assembles a fake bomb, the other three hijackers wrestle their way into the cockpit, holding off the flight attendants, herding the passengers to the back of the plane, and then killing the pilots Jason Dahl, and LeRoy Homer, Jr.. The hijacker Ziad Jarrah tries to tell the passengers to Keep remaining[sic] sitting, we have a bomb on board. So sit. He accidentally transmits this and another message to Cleveland Air Traffic Control, which he realises later, turning off Flight 93's transponder. Flight 93 turns towards D.C. while Ben Sliney ultimately decides to shut down all airspace in the United States and ground every flight. By this time, Flight 77 has crashed into the Pentagon. The passengers on Flight 93 begin making phone calls to family through the on-board GTE Airfone system. After hearing that planes have crashed into the WTC and the Pentagon, they realize that if they do nothing they will also die, and eventually elect to storm the cockpit and retake the plane using whatever makeshift weapons they can. They wait for the right moment, as the hijackers eventually realise the passengers are thinking of taking back the plane. One of the hijackers asks Jarrah how much time they may have left, and he says 20 minutes. The hijacker responds with We don't have twenty minutes! This turns out to be all but false, as the passengers begin the revolt. After Haznawi is beaten down and killed, Ahmed al-Nami warns Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al-Ghamdi in the cockpit of the passenger's revolt, and attempts to hold off the advancing passengers with a food cart, pepper spray, and a fire extinguisher; he too is soon overwhelmed and is killed by having his neck snapped. Ziad Jarrah shakes the plane violently but the passengers manage to enter the cockpit; however, as they attempt to gain control, the plane plummets into an upside down nosedive.

Raoul, the Viscount of Chagny ([[Patrick Wilson , now an old wheelchair-bound man, purchases a coveted music box. During the auction, Raoul spots a familiar figure: Madame Giry , whom he met as a young man. Madame Giry is now an old woman, almost 50 years later. But he is distracted by the next piece for auction, lot 666: a chandelier in pieces which has been restored and newly electrically wired. As the auctioneers display the restored chandelier, the opening crescendo of music wipes away the years of decay from the opera house as the black and white turns into color, and the audience is transported back in time to 1870, the beginning of the story, when the opera was in its prime. A disfigured musical genius called ""The Phantom""  lives within the deepest recess of the opera house. Tormented by his scarred face, the Phantom lives in the watery labyrinths beneath the Opéra Populaire in Paris. After nearly ten years of quiet obsession with the delicate, ethereal voice of Christine Daaé  and the beautiful young soprano herself, he plots to place his protégé at center stage. Christine is caught between her love for Raoul, her childhood sweetheart who has returned into her life, and her fascination and pity for the Phantom. Angry and possessive, the Phantom plots to make Christine his, resorting to stalking her wherever she goes as well as killing several people including Piangi. A swordfight later ensues in the cemetery, where Raoul eventually disarms him and is about to kill him when Christine pleads for him not to, ""not like this."" His rage seemingly augmented, the Phantom angrily states as Christine and Raoul walk away: ""Now, let it be war upon you both."" During the night's play, he steals Christine away and avoids the trap to be captured by Raoul and the managers. After a series of tense, chaotic sequences, including dropping the chandelier  and setting the opera house on fire, the Phantom imprisons Raoul, who attempts to save Christine, and threatens to strangle him to death if Christine does not choose the Phantom. Christine kisses the Phantom in order to save Raoul's life, while displaying her pity and compassion for him. Ashamed of what he's done, he begs Christine and Raoul to leave for he realizes if he really loves Christine he should set her free. Just before she departs with Raoul on the boat, Christine approaches the Phantom, who tells her that he loves her, and gives him the diamond ring from her finger. Christine and Raoul row away singing to each other as Christine glances back at the Phantom. After they leave, the Phantom then uses a candelabrum to smash every mirror in his underground lair and he disappears behind a velvet curtain into an empty glass mirror portal, before the police arrive. Upon entering, Meg, the ballet mistress's daughter, finds only the Phantom's white mask. Later, the grainy black and white picture dominates as the elderly Raoul rides to a cemetery where he goes to visit Christine's tomb, which reveals that she died only two years before, in 1917, at age 63. Her tombstone says ""Vicomtess of Chagny"" and ""beloved wife and mother"", suggesting she married Raoul, had children and died of old age. He lays the monkey music box at her grave site, and notices that on the left of the tombstone lies a red rose with a black ribbon tied around it  with the engagement ring attached to it, implying that the Phantom is still alive, and will always love Christine.paris, france dancing obsession mask musical remake tragic villain based on play or musical black and white rooftop disfigured face theater opera singer 1910s",False,tt0293508,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,154648887,0,0,1.2092698142857143,1.9257596443831189,,,,,,,41827785.5,2,119327785.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,119338986.5,12.0,143691755.5,2.0,-16024051.5,6.0,9975948.5,4.0,8692499.5,7.0,25317499.5,4.0,133333738.0,19.0,137833738.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,111435394.66666667,192102061.33333334,3.0,20836407.666666668,79336407.66666667,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,77438486.1111111,107216263.8888889,9.0,28669707.0,62003040.333333336,3.0,39558115.0,74558115.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,129186764.5,161811764.5,4.0,-17855713.0,8644287.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,87229345.4,57433791.6,5.75,2.8,84824632.31357588

Ian is supposedly a bank manager and is, much to Alex's regret, often away from home. One day, Alex is told that his uncle has died in a car crash, but quickly discovers that his uncle was in fact a spy working for MI6 and that he was killed by the assassin, Yassen Gregorovich. He is then recruited by his uncle's former employers, Alan Blunt and Mrs. Jones of the Special Operations Division of MI6, who explain to Alex that his uncle has been training him as a spy; Alex initially refuses to cooperate but agrees when they threaten to prosecute then deport Jack  for being an illegal immigrant. Alex is then sent to a grueling SAS training camp where his fellow trainees first look down on him because of his age, but he soon gains respect for his capabilities. He sets off on his first mission, aided by gadgets from Smithers. American billionaire Darrius Sayle is donating free high-powered computer systems codenamed Stormbreaker to every school in the United Kingdom. MI6 are suspicious of his seemingly generous plans and send Alex undercover as a competition winner to investigate. There, he meets the man himself, Sayle and his two accomplices, Mr. Grin and Nadia Vole and is shown the Stormbreaker computer in action. Later, while Alex is having dinner with Sayle, the suspicious Vole steals Alex's phone and tracks the SIM card to his house in Chelsea. She goes there and finds Alex's true identity; while there, she is disturbed by and consequently fights Jack. Despite being outclassed, Jack wins with the help of a blowfish, leaving Nadia to flee the scene. Still troubled by the events, Alex sneaks out of his bedroom window to observe a midnight delivery of mysterious containers to Sayle's lair. The next day, Alex finds himself in trouble when his cover is blown. After trying to escape from the facility, he is captured and during a villain-esque monologue, Sayle explains his true reasons behind Stormbreaker - each system contains a deadly virus which when activated will kill all the UK's schoolchildren. Sayle leaves Alex tied up and departs for the London Science Museum. Nadia drops Alex into a water-tank to be killed by a giant Portuguese Man o' War, but he escapes using the metal-disintegrating spot cream supplied by Smithers, rupturing the tank and killing Nadia when the jellyfish hits her. Alex then hitches a ride on a helicopter piloted by Mr. Grin, using a sodium pentothal arrow to gain Mr. Grin's obedience. Alex parachutes out of the helicopter and lands just as the Prime Minister is about to press the button which will activate the computers. Alex uses a rifle to shoot the podium, which destroys the button, and ruins Sayle's plan. Sayle is furious and leaves, but Alex then realizes that Sayle has a back-up plan, and with the help of school friend Sabina Pleasure, he pursues Sayle through the streets of London. Fifty floors up on one of Sayle's skyscrapers, Alex reaches him and unplugs his backup plan. An angered Sayle chases him out onto the roof and pushes him off but Alex manages to hold on with a cable. Sayle is distracted by the arrival of Sabina just as he is about to kill Alex, but pushes her off as well and leaves her hanging off the building by Alex's hand. Just as Sayle is about to shoot Alex, Sayle is killed when Yassen arrives in a helicopter and shoots him  before rescuing Alex. Yassen tells Alex to forget about him, but Alex refuses, saying that the killing of Ian means they are still enemies. Alex returns to school; he and Sabina are talking about what happened and he says that it will never happen again. The film ends with someone observing Alex from a distance. He notices it and realizes that it's not the end.england based on novel or book secret intelligence service child hero wretch teen spy based on young adult novel",False,tt0457495,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,23937870,0,0,-0.6709924483673777,-3.847336948521819,-3088668.0,15911332.0,,,12687459.5,66687459.5,,0,,,,0.0,,,21238082.666666668,10.0,46638082.666666664,6.0,513496310.14285713,11.0,618210595.8571428,7.0,49452623.5,5.0,81402623.5,4.0,,0.0,,,90609819.5,3.0,113359819.5,4.0,20500000.0,2.0,38000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,59098209.5,66598209.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-10730514.0,119269486.0,1.0,-11220741.0,7529259.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,81196419.0,91196419.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,179522224.3047619,139059367.16190475,3.875,4.4,92887866.92008553

But once the collar is on, Danny is a harmless, withdrawn person, with very little knowledge of how to live as a socialized person, and he is constantly bullied by his master Bart. One day, Bart realizes he can end his loan shark career by regularly attending an underground fighting tournament and registering Danny to fight; in exchange, if Danny can win and survive the fights, Bart receives good money. After the first fight, however, Bart gets into a mishap with another criminal and is left for dead after a violent shooting. A critically injured Danny runs off to an antique warehouse for shelter, where he meets a kindly piano tuner, Sam . Danny soon finds himself with Sam and his step-daughter Victoria  in their apartment, and he starts a new life with the benevolent family; curiously he is drawn closer to music while spending time with Victoria. He also develops curiosity about who his mother was when he learns what a family is. Weeks later Sam informs Danny about moving back to New York, where he and Victoria are originally from. He invites Danny, telling him they think of him as family, and Danny happily accepts. However, Danny runs into Bart’s right-hand man Lefty in the streets and is forced back to Bart, who is still alive. Bart drags Danny back to the underground arena, where a death-match is set between Danny and ruthless martial artists. Despite Danny’s pleas, Bart shoves him into the pit, where he is pummeled by four fighters. Danny eventually retaliates, but refuses to kill them. Enraged by Danny’s change of character, Bart drags him back home and shuts him back to his cage. That night, however, Danny sneaks through his door and goes through photographs of Bart’s favorite prostitutes, finally finding one snapshot of who appears to be Danny’s own mother. He interrogates Bart, who tells him that she was simply a prostitute who is long gone. He angrily promises to make Danny repay him for the money he had lost earlier that evening. Next morning, however, Danny manages to escape and runs back to Sam and Victoria, telling them what he had learned and where he was. With the two's help, Danny regains memories from his childhood past: his mother was a music student with no money, so she offered herself to Bart to get some to pay for her lessons. But one day, Bart shot her when she defied him. Bart has been raising Danny ever since, not as a human being, but as a dog. Bart and a plethora of thugs arrive at Sam's apartement building to capture Danny. Frantic, Danny hides Sam and Victoria in their closet, and he runs out to take out the thugs all over the building. He then faces off against an attacker  with skills similar to his own; Danny eventually causes him to fall to his death on Bart's car. A vengeful Bart pursues Danny through the building with a gun, finally catching him in Sam's apartment. He threatens to pull the trigger, all the while telling him that he was never meant for a different kind of lifestyle. But he drops the gun and instead takes out a collar, telling Danny to come home. Danny slowly advances toward the collar, but stops Bart at the last minute and disarms him. He proceeds to furiously beat Bart, causing Sam and Victoria to burst out and frantically beg Danny not to kill; however, a defeated Bart orders Danny otherwise. Bart then tells Danny he will always be an animal, to which Sam responds by smashing a flower pot on his head, knocking him unconscious. Danny, Sam, and Victoria embrace. Some time later, Danny is with Sam at a piano recital at Carnegie Hall, where Victoria is getting ready to perform. Realizing Victoria is playing what his mother played years ago, Danny sheds a happy tear.martial arts hitman serial killer",False,tt0342258,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,50871113,1,0,0.13046917777777778,-2.6760407675788414,14276451.666666666,42709785.0,-12999752.0,7000248.0,,,,0,,,-50129433.0,7.0,19870567.0,1.0,-4139024.0,23.0,22235976.0,8.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-25454936.0,1545064.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21053271.5,-27134228.5,3.75,4.5,109858494.28372188

Frances, a failing American actress who has resorted to doing voice acting for children's cartoons, wants the money so that she can get out of the rut she believes she is stuck in, and also because she wants a Mercedes to replace her aging Pontiac Firebird. Throughout the course of the film, the women threaten the mobsters in order to persuade them to give them a cut of the heist money. As the film progresses, the danger the women are in becomes more obvious, and just as it appears that they are out of their depth when Frances' car is blown up and Shannon is almost kidnapped, they successfully break into Mason's house and confront him and one of his gang. A mass shoot-out occurs after it becomes clear that the girls have stolen all of Mason's guns and have bagged all the money. They manage to get away in the gang members' Porsche Boxster with the bags of money. The hospital equipment is delivered to Shannon's hospital anonymously, as Shannon and Frances look on. They then drive off into London in the Mercedes CLK that they bought with some of the money, happy that they have done the right thing.nurse blackmail teacher best friend bank robbery",False,tt0253126,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,226792,0,0,-43.09326607640481,-0.8553948535632829,,,31497311.0,59497311.0,,,-22797121.0,3,19202879.0,2.0,,0.0,,,71652096.5,14.0,119152096.5,2.0,3400000.0,2.0,4000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,266689294.0,5.0,320689294.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,233212670.0,251212670.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,233212670.0,251212670.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4228953.0,5728953.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,115761067.375,79736067.375,3.0,1.5,121757219.71668534

She was born in Bucharest, Romania to American parents who then moved back to America. When Vivian was nine years old, her parents and siblings were killed by two hunters and she moved back to Bucharest to live with her aunt Astrid, then the mate of the pack's leader, Gabriel . To Astrid's distress, Gabriel left her after seven years in accordance with pack law to choose a new mate. The culmination of another seven years is only a few months away and Gabriel wants the reluctant Vivian as his mate. Gabriel and Astrid have a son, Rafe, with whom Vivian has an uneasy relationship. Rafe, considering himself the future pack leader, has hunted and killed a human girl on his own in violation of his father's law which allows the loup-garou to hunt only as a pack. Every full moon the pack hunt a human prey who is either a danger to the pack or has offended one of its members . After having been cut to leave a blood scent, the human is sent to flee through the woods and if he manages to cross the river, is spared. However, no one has ever managed to reach the river. One night, Vivian breaks into an abandoned church containing loup-garou iconography. There she meets Aiden , a graphic novel artist who also broke in for inspiration. Aiden is instantly smitten and pursues her for several days before she finally agrees to start seeing him. They meet in secret and fall in love. They are soon discovered by Rafe, and his four friends. Rafe informs Gabriel about the relationship between Vivian and Aiden and is ordered to do whatever is necessary to get Aiden out of the city, either by bribing or by threatening. Following a note from Vivian, Aiden goes to a chapel outside the city, where he is apprehended and threatened by Rafe . During the altercation, Rafe is revealed as a loup-garou and tries to kill Aiden, who manages to kill his attacker with the help of his silver medallion . Gabriel and Astrid are devastated at the death of their son. Aiden is caught at the train station and is chosen as prey for the monthly full moon hunt. Running for his life, Aiden spreads his blood around on the trees to confuse his pursuers and stabs two wolves with a silver knife. He finally crosses the river but a furious Gabriel attacks him nonetheless. Vivian, in her wolf-shape, jumps in and pushes Gabriel into the river. Not recognizing her in her wolf-shape, Aiden slashes her arm with the knife. When she changes back into her human shape, he is stricken with guilt and tries to help her. They flee to a deserted film company which the loup-garou would not dare enter as it is riddled with silver dust. After a few tender moments, Astrid appears and confronts them with a gun. Vivian pleads for Aiden's life, appealing to Astrid's unhappy love for Gabriel, and Astrid lets them go. The two retrieve an antidote for Vivian from a human pharmacist working for Gabriel. However, the pharmacist alerts the pack to their presence and Vivian is captured while Aiden escapes. Vivian is imprisoned and confronted by Gabriel, who disparages humans and relates to her a prophecy about a female loup-garou leading her people into an ""age of hope"". He had hoped her to fulfill the prophecy but now decides that the two must decide the conflict by hunting each other. Before the hunt can begin, Gabriel is shot by Aiden, who had been watching from a skylight. In the ensuing battle, Aiden blinds some of Gabriel's henchmen with silver dust, traps some and sets the building on fire. Gabriel attacks Aiden but before he can strike a possibly fatal blow, Vivian aims a gun at Gabriel. He taunts her that by shooting him she would become the hunter that once killed her family and shifts into his wolf-shape. Aiden pleads with Vivian to shoot Gabriel but she repeatedly refuses. However, when Gabriel sets out to kill Aiden, she shoots and kills Gabriel. This means that Vivian is now the pack's Alpha. Feeling guilty, she strokes Gabriel's fur. As the building explodes, she frees the trapped loup-garou and runs away with Aiden. The two escape the city in Gabriel's car . They discuss two destinations, either the ""age of hope"" or Paris, and drive through Bucharest's Arcul de Triumf.chocolate based on novel or book werewolf woman director interspecies romance animal horror based on young adult novel",True,tt0397044,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,6551310,0,0,-1.2896184121954235,-6.117028646878049,,,,,,,,0,,,16195367.333333334,3.0,89862034.0,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-5732806.0,5.0,267194.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,83452198.0,125202198.0,2.0,,,,,,,73708457.0,95708457.0,1.0,73708457.0,95708457.0,1.0,-49867.0,9950133.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,89847449.0,151847449.0,2.0,,,,-15430082.0,1569918.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,45064614.0,5231280.666666667,1.0,2.0,105980128.20199434

Charles Hatton  creates a ""Time Safari"" service, offering the opportunity for wealthy clients to travel to prehistoric days and hunt dinosaurs. The expedition, led by Travis Ryer , is set under very specific rules to avoid altering history: their targets are a set of dinosaurs that will imminently be killed by lava from an erupting volcano, frozen nitrogen bullets are used as ammo to leave no trace, and the party wears self-contained suits and told to stay on a floating path and to not touch anything. Further, all the guns are tied to Travis Ryer's weapon, and will not fire until he does so. The team is initially led by Travis Ryer, along with Jenny Krase, Payne, Clay Derris, Dr.Lucas. Their guests Alicia Wallenbeck and John Wallenbeck join the Expedition. When they successfully complete the expedition and return to the future, Charles Hatton organizes a Party to celebrate the success of the first expedition. The party is interrupted by Sonia Rand, who tosses red wine on Alicia, John and Charles. Sonia is one of the inventors of the time machine but voted against making it a business. She is later confronted by Travis and the two have a brief conversation in Sonia's Lab, Sonia explains to him the danger of using the time machine. During another trip while escorting clients Eckles  and Middleton , Ryer's gun fails as their target Allosaurus rushes the party. Ryer tells the tourists to take cover while he corrects the weapon in time to kill the Allosaurus. Ryer removes traces of their presence and quickly takes the tourists back to the present, unaware that Middleton has accidentally stepped off the path while taking cover. After the second expedition, Alicia sleeps with Travis. Then, news is aired on TV, which describes rapid changes in the environment, as Travis looks at a small plant that is now large and wild. On a subsequent trip to the same point in time with a different group, Ryer is shocked to find that events have changed as the Allosaurus is already dead and the volcano has erupted too soon. When Ryer returns to report this, ""Time Safari"" is immediately shut down by the federal agency that oversees time travel technology. Just as Ryer is in a taxi cab, the road collapses, leading some cars to go under it and people start panicking. Ryer seeks out Sonia Rand , the inventor of the time travel technology. Rand had long had reservations about ""Time Safari"", and worries that events will play out as she had predicted. Suddenly, the two feel themselves caught in a wave front, which Rand later identifies as a time wave that is a result of the changes in the past. It causes the vegetation and animal life in her greenhouse to grow rapidly and dangerously. They heard a woman screaming knocking at the door and Sonia opens it as they encounter a swarm of large type beetles. The woman falls dead on the floor. They panic, Travis gets the water hose and electrocutes the insects causing a large explosion, forcing the two to evacuate. Rand warns several more time waves can be expected, each affecting more advanced parts of life and, eventually, humans themselves. Returning to Time Safari, the federal agency works with Ryer and Hatton to send Ryer back to the past to try and correct it. Instead, Ryer appears in the American Southwest during the 18th century; he quickly returns to the present time as another time wave hits, it knocks down the power out from the building and leaving the city covered in dense vegetation.They decided to took over the events, the team's technician Payne  discovers that one of the tourists on the earlier expedition came back from the past one gram heavier. Though such discrepancies would have been found with the required ""bio-filter"" on their return, Hatton had paid off a federal agent to avoid the costly process. The small team including Travis, Sonia, Payne, Clay and Jenny head outside to find out what's going on, but Payne is bitten by a strange poisonous plant. As the group walks, they encounter an ape like dinosaur creature that attacks Clay but Travis saves him by shooting the creature. Just as they flee, a large group of creatures follow them and, since Payne is dying, he offers himself to the creatures so that the team can escape. They track down Eckles first and find a group of survivors barricading themselves in a building where Travis saves a man and his son in a grocery store from the ape-like creatures. They find Eckles but it seems he did not do anything. So they track down Middleton. As they entered the building they find a man with a gun, but Middleton shoots him and threatens to shoot Travis, but Travis shoots him. They confirm that Middleton had stepped off the path, crushing a butterfly and thus altered history. When another time wave completely severes power to the Time Safari time portal, the group realizes the only option is to travel to the nearby university to use its particle accelerator like a time machine to send someone back to intercept the original expedition and prevent Middleton from stepping off the path. Travis, Sonia, Jenny And Clay travel to the Main Laboratory, but just as they are on the road, bat like creatures attack them and kill Clay. As another time wave appears, the car loses control and hits a building. They get out and find that Charles and members of the crew are dead. They also find Dr. Lucas hiding. Travis convinces Dr. Lucas to come with them but he refuses. As soon as the team gets out, he changes his mind and follows them but is too late, the ape like creatures appear and kill him. The group then decides to use the underground railway because its safer, but to make matters worse it turned into a swamp. As they get inside a train, the ceiling of the tunnel collapses, flooding it and the three are trapped inside. The water floods the train and Travis decides to blow the window so they can escape. While they are escaping, a long dragon fish like creature appears and devours Jenny, forcing Travis and Sonia escape, but as they escape the creature grabs hold Travis and is ready to devour him. The ceiling of the tunnel then fully collapses trapping and killing the creature with the debris. Sonia helps Travis and they arrive at the University while the ape like creatures followed them. Sonia is able to make the modifications and send Ryer back in time just as a time wave hits, leaving her as catfish-like humanoid. In the prehistoric path, Ryer successfully intercepts the hunting party while handing over a video recording to Jenny, with the group returning immediately to the future, this future version of Ryer disappears. Back in the present, Travis confronts Charles to stop the expeditions, as Jenny gives him the video that future-Travis gave her and kisses present-Travis. Ryer watches the video tape by himself, and takes it to Rand. They agree that the video contains enough evidence to put an end to Time Safari.dying and death time travel romance cloning dinosaur based on short story alternate timeline changing the past or future allosaurus butterfly effect evil scientist",True,tt0318081,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,5989640,1,0,-12.356395376015925,-2.6760407675788414,-21097985.0,18902015.0,,,-12946185.0,27053815.0,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,15865414.666666666,23.0,33632081.333333336,3.0,,0.0,,,30804648.5,63304648.5,2.0,72178834.5,105178834.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,-12946185.0,27053815.0,1.0,-12538327.333333334,26128339.333333332,3.0,101265204.0,179265204.0,1.0,-21097985.0,18902015.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-5067854.0,9932146.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-19494788.5,30505211.5,2.0,-17022085.0,22977915.0,2.0,518076739.0,600576739.0,2.0,,,33632081.333333336,15865414.666666666,2.875,3.0,109858494.28372188

One of the chimps escapes using warfare technology that he was being trained to use. Dr. Angelo is generally a pacifist, who would rather explore the intelligence-enhancing potential of his research without applying it for military purposes. Jobe Smith, a local greenskeeper with an unspecified learning disability, lives in the garden shed owned by the local priest, Father Francis McKeen. McKeen's brother, Terry, is a local landscape gardener and employs Jobe to help him with odd jobs. Father McKeen punishes the challenged Jobe with a belt whenever he fails to complete his chores. While Dr. Angelo records audio notes about needing a human subject, Jobe is mowing his lawn. Peter Parkette, the young son of Dr. Angelo's neighbors, is friends with Jobe. Dr. Angelo invites Peter and Jobe to play some virtual reality games. Learning more about Jobe, Angelo persuades Jobe to participate in his experiments, telling him that it will make him smarter. Jobe agrees and begins a program of accelerated learning. Dr. Angelo makes it a point to redesign all the intelligence-boosting treatments without the ""aggression factors"" used in the chimpanzee experiments. Jobe soon becomes smarter, for example, learning Latin in two hours at the lab. Dr. Angelo starts taking Jobe to his lab at work to use the technology there. Jobe begins a sexual relationship with a young rich widow, Marnie. However, Jobe starts to have telepathic and hallucinatory experiences. He continues with the experiments at the lab, until an accident makes Dr. Angelo call a halt. The project director, Sebastian Timms, employed by a mysterious agency known as The Shop, keeps a secret watch on the progress of the experiment, and swaps the scientist's new medications for the old Project 5 ""aggression factors"". Jobe acquires telekinetic and pyrokinetic powers and takes Marnie to the lab to have sexual intercourse with her in virtual reality. Something goes wrong in the simulation, and Marnie is driven insane, laughing endlessly at nothing. Jobe's powers and abilities continue to grow, although the treatments also affect his mental stability, and he takes revenge on those who abused him when he was ""dumb"": Father McKeen is engulfed in flames, a bully named Jake is put into a catatonic state by a mental ""lawnmower man"" continually mowing his brain, and a lawnmower invention of Jobe's runs down Harold, Peter's abusive father. Jobe uses his telepathic abilities to make the investigating police attribute it all to ""bizarre accidents"" in front of Dr. Angelo. Jobe believes his final stage of evolution is to become ""pure energy"" in the VSI computer mainframe, and from there reach into all the systems of the world. He promises his ""birth"" will be signaled by every telephone on the planet ringing simultaneously. The Shop sends a team to capture Jobe, but they are ineffective against his abilities and he scatters their molecules. Jobe uses the lab equipment to enter the mainframe computer, abandoning his body to become a wholly virtual being. In the process, his body becomes a wizened husk. Dr. Angelo remotely infects the VSI computer with a virus that encrypts all of the links to the outside world, trapping Jobe in the mainframe. As Jobe searches for an unencrypted network connection, Dr. Angelo primes bombs to destroy the building. Feeling responsible for what has happened to Jobe, Angelo then joins him in virtual reality to try to reason with him. Jobe overpowers and crucifies him, then continues to search for a network connection. Peter runs into the building; Jobe still cares for him and allows Dr. Angelo to go free in order to rescue Peter. Jobe forces a computer-connected lock to open, allowing Peter and Dr. Angelo to escape. Jobe escapes through a Backdoor as the building is destroyed in multiple explosions. Back at home with Peter, Dr. Angelo and Peter's mother Carla  are about to leave when their telephone rings, followed by the noise of a second, and then hundreds, all around the globe.dream chimp manipulation botanist virtual reality lemonade intelligent",False,tt0104692,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,32101000,0,0,2.2101,2.6736984935700776,-3080347.0,1919653.0,7090334.0,13878334.0,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,10244207.0,10.0,22244207.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22244207.0,10244207.0,1.25,1.0,96568078.59273516

Roscuro , a rat, is aboard with a human companion, Pietro. Roscuro is mesmerized by the aroma of soup being prepared in the castle's kitchens and he escapes Pietro to find the source. In doing so, he finds the castle banquet room and accidentally falls into the Queen's soup after she takes the first sip. The Queen then gets shocked and faints from sheer terror, falls headfirst in her soup bowl and eventually drowns with no one noticing. Meanwhile, Roscuro is being chased about the castle. The chase finally ends when Roscuro falls into a vent and plunges into the dungeons. The king in his grief orders soup to be forbidden and rats banished. These were the Dark Ages and the town falls into eternal darkness and famine. Roscuro, meanwhile, meets Botticelli , the brutal leader of the rat world. A few years later, an adventurous mouse, Despereaux Tilling  is born, and becomes friends with the lonely Princess Pea . Upon finding out that Despereaux has broken the law by speaking with a human, the Mouse Council banishes him to the dungeons. Antoinette Tilling , Despereaux's mother tries to run through to stop the Mouse Council from sending Despereaux into the dungeon, but Lester , Antoinette's husband, grabs her by the arm, because he cares more about the Mouse Council than he does about Despereaux. In the dungeon, Despereaux is caught, but he is saved by Roscuro from being eaten by the other rats. Despereaux tells Roscuro of the princess's gloom, which touches the rat. Roscuro approaches the princess to apologize, but she is terrified of him and he is chased out. Hurt, he decides to kidnap the princess. He enlists the help of a servant girl, Miggery Sow , whom he later double crosses, and locks in a cell. Meanwhile, Despereaux realizes that the princess is in danger. Back in the rat colony, Roscuro sees the apologetic sincerity in Pea's eyes and regrets his actions, but is unable to stop the rats, to whom he has given her, from clambering over her. Roscuro tries to tell the rats that Pea is not bad, but Botticelli does not let him because he wants Pea dead, even going as far as allowing the rats to eat or trample over Pea. Roscoro figures out that Botticelli is a double-crossing traitor and that Pea is doomed. However, little Despereaux lets loose a cat, and the rats run away before the cat goes back into its cage. Roscuro then forces Botticelli into the cage, where he is eaten by the cat. Mig is later reunited with her father, who recognizes the birthmark on her neck. It finally rains and the sun shines after soup is made for the first time in years. The mice all then try to be more brave like Despereaux. The king is able to overcome his grief and soup and rats were allowed back in the kingdom. Roscuro returns to a life at sea, where there was always light and a gentle breeze, and Despereaux himself takes off on a journey to see the world.loyalty totalitarian regime mouse forgiveness honor unlikely friendship courage chivalry animal lead",False,tt0420238,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,86947965,1,0,0.44913275,-1.6278585820155915,,,,,,,-27330724.0,15,669276.0,1.0,46409175.0,37.0,60009175.0,2.0,764420472.0,7.0,895420472.0,5.0,,0.0,,,24414374.2,26.0,38514374.2,5.0,63618973.0,29.0,91318973.0,5.0,16980037.666666668,12.0,69313371.0,3.0,,0.0,,,851475550.0,976475550.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,66087290.5,111087290.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,41979149.0,130979149.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,179834564.0,224834564.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,192540940.2,148085384.64444444,15.75,3.5,95612307.5388973

To evade the police, he becomes the valet for Phileas Fogg, an inventor. Phileas is trying to break the 50-mph speed barrier, and after succeeding with the help of Passepartout, they head to the Royal Academy of Science. There, Fogg is insulted by the other ""brilliant minds"", in particular William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, who believes that everything worth discovering has already been discovered. Phileas is pressured into a bet to see whether he can travel around the world in 80 days. If he wins he will become Minister of Science in Lord Kelvin's place, if not he will destroy his lab and never invent anything again. Phileas and Passepartout start their journey around the world, taking a carriage and leaving London after a confrontation with Inspector Fix, a corrupt officer hired by the Royal Academy of Science to stop them. Passepartout and Phileas journey to Paris. Pretending to take Phileas to a convention with Thomas Edison, Passepartout leads him to an art school where Phileas meets Monique La Roche, a would-be impressionist. There, Passepartout is attacked by warriors sent by General Fang, who is after the Jade Buddha that he stole. Fang had previously given it to Kelvin in exchange for military assistance in China. When Monique learns of Phileas's ambition, she convinces them to take her with them. They depart in a hot-air balloon, chased by Fang's warriors. Whilst on the Orient Express, Monique learns that Passepartout is trying to return the Jade Buddha back to his village, and is travelling with Phileas to get there quickly. Monique keeps his secret in exchange for him convincing Phileas to let her travel with him. They travel to Turkey, where they are greeted by Prince Hapi. The Prince orders Monique to stay as his seventh wife while the men are ordered to leave. The men blackmail Prince Hapi into releasing Monique using a prized but apparently flimsy ""The Thinker"" statue of the Prince. The statue is destroyed but the three travellers escape. Lord Kelvin learns that Phileas has been involuntarily abetting a thief's escape. He orders the British colonial authorities in India to arrest both. Passepartout sees notice of the price on his head and warns his companions. Disguised as women they evade the police but are attacked by Fang's warriors. Using Inspector Fix and a sextant as weapons, they defeat their assailants and flee to China. Passepartout leads his friends to his village where they are happily greeted. They spend several days there and are attacked by the Black Scorpions. Phileas, Monique and Passepartout, whose name is revealed to be Lau Xing, are held captive. Lau Xing challenges the leader of the group to a fight. At first he fights alone and is defeated; moments later he is joined by the martial arts masters of the ""Ten Tigers of Canton"", of which he is one. The Tigers drive the Black Scorpions from the village and free the Westerners. The Buddha is returned to the village temple. Phileas, unhappy that his companions used him, leaves China alone. He travels to San Francisco and is tricked out of his money. He is found by Lau Xing and Monique. In the desert they find the Wright brothers and the three inventors discuss the flying machine. Phileas finds the brothers' plans brilliant but suggests a few changes. Lau Xing, Monique, and Phileas' next stop is New York City, where a crowd greets them, making it impossible for them to reach their ship. A policeman takes them through a building he claims is a shortcut, but it is an ambush. Fang's minions made arrangements with Lord Kelvin to take Lau Xing's village and tap the jade reserves underneath it, but if Phileas wins the bet Lord Kelvin will not have the means to help them. A battle against Fang and her minions commences in the workshop where the Statue of Liberty was constructed, ending in Fang being knocked out by Monique. The three friends are victorious. Though Phileas could have gotten the boat, he misses it to help Lau Xing. Phileas feels he has lost, but the other two say they may still make it if they catch the next ship. They board an old ship and Phileas convinces the captain to let him build a plane out of the ship's old wood in exchange for a new ship. Using the changed Wright brothers' plans, Phileas builds a plane while the ship's crew builds a catapult to launch it into the sky. They reach London, where the machine falls apart and they crash in front of the Royal Academy. Lord Kelvin sends police to stop them from making it to the top step of the Royal Academy of Science, and the clock strikes noon, ending the wager. Lord Kelvin proclaims himself the victor. Monique, Fix and other ministers attest to Kelvin's unfair methods and his bullying nature, but Kelvin scoffs at them. In the process he insults Queen Victoria, who is nearby listening. She learned that he had sold her arsenal to Fang in exchange for jade mines in China thanks to one of his aides. Kelvin is arrested, but vows revenge on all of England, especially Phileas. Phileas realizes he is one day early thanks to crossing the international date line. He ascends the stairs of the Academy and kisses Monique, victorious in his bet.paris, france london, england new york city jules verne san francisco, california hot air balloon journey around the world queen victoria",True,tt0327437,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,72178895,0,0,-0.5239911888371248,1.9257596443831189,,,,,,,,0,,,-3611233.0,0.0,27388767.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,53033841.666666664,12.0,62934764.666666664,6.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,78969173.42857143,110254887.71428572,7.0,-21097985.0,18902015.0,1.0,,,,96394239.0,123894239.0,2.0,8149506.0,51649506.0,2.0,,,,,,,11509500.666666666,19442834.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,85072577.0,120072577.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28049560.0,143049560.0,1.0,,,,220299215.0,282299215.0,2.0,,,,13336589.95,37671589.95,20.0,,,45161765.83333333,24711304.333333332,1.5,3.5,84824632.31357588

But in battle his courage fails him, and, to avoid being killed, he plays dead—while his unit is massacred. He is transported along with the other dead  back to the Mexican headquarters. However, in a moment of sudden bravery, he captures the Mexican command. For his heroism Boyd is promoted to Captain, but when his commanding officer learns of the cowardice by which his victory was achieved, he exiles Boyd to the remote Fort Spencer in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. After Boyd joins the seven other inhabitants of Fort Spencer, a stranger named Colqhoun arrives and describes his wagon train becoming lost in the Sierra Nevadas and being reduced to cannibalism to avoid starvation. The party's guide, a Colonel Ives, had promised the party a shorter route to the Pacific Ocean but instead led them on a more circuitous route, and was then the one to lead their turn to cannibalism. The soldiers stationed at the fort see it as their duty to investigate and search for survivors, and so assemble a rescue party. Before they leave they are warned by their Native American scout, George, of the Wendigo myth; a story that a man consuming the flesh of his enemies takes their strength but becomes a demon cursed by a hunger for human flesh. When they reach the cave where the party had taken refuge they realize that Colqhoun is Ives and has lured them into a trap. He had killed his five companions and sets about killing the soldiers from Fort Spencer one by one, including the commanding officer, Colonel Hart. Boyd manages to escape the massacre by jumping off a cliff, breaking his leg in the process. He hides in a pit along with the body of a fellow soldier and eventually he eats some of the man's flesh to stay alive. When he finally limps back into the fort he is delirious and severely traumatized; none of the remaining soldiers  believe his wild tale, and a second expedition finds no bodies or any trace of the man. A temporary commander is assigned to the fort and to Boyd's horror it turns out to be Colqhoun, now cleaned up and calling himself Colonel Ives. The others still refuse to believe that Ives is the killer, especially after he bears no sign of the wounds inflicted on him during the massacre. Ives tells Boyd that he used to suffer from tuberculosis, but when a Native scout told him the Wendigo myth he ""just had to try,"" murdering him, eating his flesh and in the process curing his maladies. Having murdered the expedition he led he now plans to use the fort as a base to do the same to other passing travellers; he compares the location of the fort, with the guaranteed supply of isolated migrants that it entails, to the notion of Manifest Destiny that draws them there. Boyd is suspected of murder after another soldier mysteriously dies and is chained up; he watches helplessly while the last officer is murdered by an unexpected ally of Ives: Colonel Hart, back from the dead after the massacre. Ives saved Hart by feeding him his own comrades, and now Hart is addicted, like Colqhoun, to human meat. Ives wounds Boyd and forces him to make a choice: eat or die. Eventually Boyd gives in and eats a stew made out of the last officer killed, and his wound heals. But rather than join the two men in their conspiracy to convert General Slauson , he convinces Hart to free him so he can kill Ives. Hart does so, but asks Boyd to kill him first as he no longer wants to live as a cannibal. A battle between Boyd and Ives takes place at the climax, with both men wounding each other badly, yet they won't die easily due to their new recuperative powers. Finally, Boyd forces Ives onto a large bear trap and springs it, pinning them both together. Ives taunts Boyd by telling him he'll eat him as soon as he dies, but Ives expires first. Boyd refuses to save himself by eating Ives' body and dies on top of his adversary. Martha, George's sister, stumbles upon the bodies of both Ives and Boyd, closes the door, and walks away. General Slauson arrives, and, while his aide looks around—the general tastes the stew that was left on the fire.winter cliff cooking cave chase fort army murder survival snow camp soldier violence cannibal madness stranger american mexican war woman director wendigo military outpost vomiting blood",True,tt0129332,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,2062406,0,0,-4.81844699831168,15.965307217698705,,,,,,,,0,,,133420601.0,3.0,137170601.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-10870330.0,7129670.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,164816455.0,183316455.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,137170601.0,133420601.0,0.375,2.0,73407251.10798967

After she misses her train on the London Underground, the plot splits into two parallel universes, also detailing the separate path her life would have taken had she boarded that train. In the timeline in which she boards the train, she meets James ([[John Hannah  on the underground and they strike up a conversation. She gets home in time to catch her boyfriend, Gerry ([[John Lynch , in bed with his ex-girlfriend, Lydia ; she dumps him and moves in with her friend, Anna , and changes her appearance for a fresh start. James continues to serendipitously pop into Helen's life, cheering her up and encouraging her to start her own public relations firm. She and James fall in love despite Helen's reservations about beginning another relationship so soon after her ugly breakup with Gerry. Eventually, Helen discovers she's pregnant, believing it is James' child, and goes to see him at his office. She is stunned to learn from James' secretary that he is married. Upset, she disappears. James finds her on a bridge and explains that he was married but is now separated and planning to divorce. He and his soon-to-be-ex-wife maintain the appearance of a happy marriage for the sake of his sick mother. After she and James declare their love, Helen walks out into the road and is hit by a car. In the timeline in which she misses the train, she then hails a taxi instead but a man tries to snatch her handbag. Helen is injured in the scuffle and goes to the hospital. She arrives home after Lydia has left and carries on, oblivious of Gerry's infidelity, and takes two part-time jobs to pay the bills. Gerry conceals his infidelity and juggles the two women in his life; Lydia even interacts with Helen on several occasions. Helen has a number of conflicts with Gerry but discovers she's pregnant. She never manages to tell him, but does tell him that she has a job interview with an international PR firm. Gerry, thinking Helen is at her interview, goes to see Lydia at her apartment, who is also pregnant with his child. While at Lydia's, Gerry answers the doorbell and sees Helen standing at the door; she is stunned to see Gerry, while Lydia tells her she can't do the interview because she's ""deciding whether or not to keep your boyfriend's baby."" Distraught, Helen runs off and falls down Lydia's staircase while trying flee from Gerry. In both timelines, Helen goes to the hospital and loses her baby. In the timeline in which she boards the train, she dies in the arms of her newfound love, James; in the timeline in which she misses the train, she recovers and tells Gerry to leave for good. Before waking, she sees brief visions of the alternate Helen's life in a dream. In the final scene , James is leaving the hospital after visiting his mother, and Helen is leaving after ending her relationship with Gerry. Helen drops an earring in the lift and it is picked up by James. This mirrors the start of the film, where James picks up Helen's earring on the lift after Helen is fired from her job. Before the doors close, James tells Helen to cheer up, and repeats his line, ""You know what the Monty Python boys say..."" Helen  says, ""Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition."" She and James stare at one another, each surprised by her response. The lift doors close, leaving the audience to speculate whether it was fate or coincidence that brought Helen and James together under these circumstances.double life commercial chance marketing time travel in flagranti alternative reality",False,tt0120148,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,58000000,0,0,8.666666666666666,-2.5293608277783246,-15658106.833333334,17675226.5,,,118582776.0,134582776.0,,0,,,248700832.0,4.0,254700832.0,1.0,28512907.5,8.0,35762907.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21010864.0,26010864.0,1.0,226838628.5,243338628.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31931658.0,37831658.0,1.0,-33326758.0,26673242.0,1.0,,,,,,145231869.75,138606869.75,1.5,1.5,60772021.118274406

Upon entering the yeshiva, Yentl befriends a fellow student, Avigdor , and meets his fiancée, Hadass .

Meanwhile, Hadass develops romantic feelings for Yentl , while Yentl herself is falling in love with Avigdor.

Seeking an escape, Bob flies to Kuwait to report on the Iraq War and to prove to his wife and himself that he is a man. However, he stumbles onto the story of a lifetime when he meets a retired Special Forces operator, Lyn Cassady , who reveals that he was part of an American army unit training psychic spies  to develop a range of parapsychological skills including invisibility, remote viewing, and phasing. The back story is told mainly through flashbacks. In 1972, U.S. Army officer Bill Django , after accidentally falling out of a UH-1 Iroquois ""Huey"" helicopter in the Binh Duong province of Vietnam, found his men to be unable or unwilling to fire on a female Viet Cong soldier before she shot him in the chest. He then underwent a fact-finding mission prompted by a vision where the Viet Cong soldier says, ""their gentleness is their strength."" The bulk of Django's mission immersed him into the New Age movement so that, when he returned to Fort Bragg in 1980, he had long braided hair and a tattoo of a third eye surmounted on a pyramid on his chest. Facilitated by the open-minded General Hopgood ([[Stephen Lang , Django led the training of a New Earth Army, with Lyn Cassady and Larry Hooper  as his top students. The two quickly developed a lifelong rivalry because of their opposing views of how to implement the New Earth Army philosophy; Lyn wanted to emphasize the positive side of the teachings, whereas Larry was more interested in the ""dark side"". Prompted by a doodle in Bob's notebook , Lyn takes him into Iraq. They are kidnapped by criminals who want to sell them to the insurgents, but escape with fellow hostage Mahmud Daash  and are rescued by a private security detail led by Todd Nixon . When the detail is caught in a firefight, the three of them flee. Bob and Lyn then continue on Lyn's vague mission involving a vision he had of Bill Django. After taking the wrong fork in the road, their car hits an IED in the road. The other fork in the road, to the left, reads al-Qaim, Lyn's destination, but neither of them could read the Arabic on the roadsigns. Bob and Lyn wander in the desert where Lyn reveals that he had stopped a goat's heart to test the limit of his mental abilities, an action he feels has cursed him. As part of this curse, it is revealed that Hooper conducted an unauthorized LSD experiment in which a soldier killed himself, forcing Django out of the Army. Eventually, Bob and Lyn are rescued and rehabilitated at a camp run by PSIC, a private research firm engaged in psychological and psychic experiments on a herd of goats and some captured locals. To Lyn's dismay, Larry Hooper runs the firm and employs Django, now a depressed alcoholic. Bob spends time with Django and learns the ways of the New Earth Army. They spike the water and food of the base with LSD and free both the goats and captured locals. Following this, Lyn and Django fly off in a helicopter, never to be heard from again, disappearing into the sky ""like all shamans"". Bob returns to work as a reporter and writes an article about his entire experience with Lyn. However, he is frustrated in that the only portion of the story to be aired on the news is how the captives were forced to listen to 24 hours of the Barney & Friends theme song. This dilutes his story to the level of a joke, and Bob vows to continue trying to get the bigger story out. In the film's final scene, Bob exercises his own psychic abilities and, following intense concentration, runs through a solid wall in his office.vietnam veteran kuwait new age drug use paranoid fantasy hippie lifestyle",False,tt1234548,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,68729358,1,0,1.86372325,39.7198236153607,,,8785088.142857144,22666119.04761905,,,95265172.66666667,12,157931839.33333334,3.0,14555575.875,13.0,42355575.875,8.0,735261.7142857143,11.0,19092404.57142857,7.0,-4919061.0,8.0,26830939.0,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,78092667.0,95092667.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27897998.0,63897998.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,103236566.0,187036566.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,-9713701.0,17286299.0,1.0,,,,48112840.5,65612840.5,2.0,,,,,,,17194447.5,28694447.5,2.0,135305534.0,193805534.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,61552689.69494048,26409237.313988097,5.5,5.5,151278235.71911615

S. Lewis is an Oxford University academic at Magdalen College and author of The Chronicles of Narnia series of children's books. He meets the married American poet Joy Gresham and her young son Douglas on their visit to England, not yet knowing the circumstances of Gresham's troubled marriage. What begins as a formal meeting of two very different minds slowly develops into an intense feeling of connection and love. Lewis finds his quiet life with his brother Warnie disrupted by the outspoken, feisty Gresham, whose uninhibited behavior offers a sharp contrast to the rigid sensibilities of the male-dominated university. Each provides the other with new ways of viewing the world. Initially their marriage is one of convenience, a platonic union designed to allow Gresham to remain in England. But when she is diagnosed with cancer, deeper feelings surface, and Lewis' faith is tested as his wife tries to prepare him for her imminent death.bachelor stroke of fate brother oxford author falling in love",False,tt0108101,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,25842000,0,0,0.17463636363636365,-19.533412250327295,,,,,,,12647814.8,16,26947814.8,5.0,-22924916.0,3.0,2075084.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,8785258.5,30285258.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,27129228.666666668,51462562.0,3.0,-21756740.0,8058260.0,2.0,,,,-3100203.0,25899797.0,1.0,26318843.0,51818843.0,2.0,,,,-3100203.0,25899797.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,144491735.0,169741735.0,2.0,3542894.6666666665,23042894.666666668,3.0,54993712.0,62493712.0,1.0,,,,,,,185640535.0,210640535.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,14511449.4,-5138550.6,2.375,3.0,41299258.6989175

They stop the murder before Inspector Lestrade  and the police arrive to arrest Blackwood. Three months later, Holmes' eccentric behavior again annoys Watson. While he enjoys their adventures together, Watson looks forward to marrying Mary Morstan  and leaving 221B Baker Street. Meanwhile, Blackwood has been sentenced to death and requests to see Holmes in prison, where he warns of three more unstoppable deaths that will cause great changes to the world. Blackwood is subsequently hanged and pronounced dead by Watson. Three days later, Holmes is visited by Irene Adler , a professional thief and his former adversary, who asks him to find a missing man named Luke Reordan. After her departure, Holmes follows her as she meets with her secret employer, hidden in the shadows of a carriage. The concealed man states that Reordan is the key to Blackwood's plans. Holmes only learns that the man is a professor and that he intimidates Adler. Blackwood's tomb is destroyed from the inside out, Reordan is found dead inside the coffin, and sightings of a living dead Blackwood, which has left a gravedigger in shock, cause public panic. Following a series of clues from the body, Holmes and Watson find Reordan's home and discover experiments attempting to merge science with magic. After they survive a battle with Blackwood's men, Holmes is taken to the Temple of the Four Orders, a secret magical organization. The leaders – Lord Chief Justice Sir Thomas Rotheram , U.S. Ambassador Standish ([[William Hope , and Home Secretary Lord Coward  – ask Holmes to stop Blackwood, a former member of the society and, as Holmes deduces from physical similarities, Sir Thomas's son. Sir Thomas and Standish are later killed through apparently supernatural means by Blackwood, allowing him to control the Order. He plans to overthrow the British government, then conquer the United States and the world. He lures Holmes to a warehouse where he finds Adler, chained to a hook, gagged, and heading towards a bandsaw, though he saves her in time. However, Watson is injured in a series of explosions set up by Blackwood. Lord Coward, secretly working with Blackwood, issues an arrest warrant for Holmes.  Holmes goes into hiding and studies Blackwood's rituals, concluding that the next target is Parliament. Holmes tricks Coward into revealing that the plan is to kill its members. He, Adler and Watson discover a machine below the Palace of Westminster, based on Reordan's experiments, designed to release cyanide gas into the Parliament chambers, killing everyone but Blackwood and his supporters, to whom Blackwood slipped the antidote. Blackwood walks into Parliament and announces that soon all but his supporters will die. As Holmes and Watson battle Blackwood's men, Adler removes the cyanide containers from the machine and flees, pursued by Holmes. Blackwood and Coward realize their plan has failed; Coward is captured but Blackwood escapes. Holmes confronts Adler on top of the incomplete Tower Bridge, but is interrupted by Blackwood. As Holmes and Blackwood fight, Holmes tricks him into becoming entangled in the ropes and chains hanging over the Thames, while Holmes explains the technical trickery behind Blackwood's supposed magic. After a climatic fight, Blackwood, with a noose of chains around his neck, falls from the bridge and is hanged. Adler explains that her employer is Professor Moriarty, warning that Moriarty is as intelligent as Holmes but far more devious. As Watson moves out of 221B, the police report to him and Holmes that a dead officer was found near Blackwood's device. Moriarty used the confrontations with Adler and Blackwood as a diversion while he took a key component, based on the new science of radio, from the machine. Holmes looks forward to the new case and new adversary.detective scotland yard coffin black magic arrest partner sherlock holmes murder steampunk pentagram clue",False,tt0988045,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,524028679,1,0,4.8225408777777785,39.7198236153607,160507618.5,237507618.5,-25061851.0,14938149.0,,,29831489.333333332,14,75231489.33333333,3.0,31055339.42857143,10.0,89198196.57142857,7.0,27784194.0,0.0,87784194.0,1.0,20642613.714285713,13.0,63485470.85714286,7.0,1183857.0,5.0,7083857.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,6510837.0,4.0,14010837.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,456178530.0,564511863.3333334,3.0,197785837.0,372785837.0,2.0,171222468.0,208722468.0,2.0,24725430.0,34562930.0,4.0,61286096.0,76286096.0,1.0,7739015.0,25739015.0,1.0,324968763.0,474968763.0,1.0,78511035.0,132511035.0,1.0,7739015.0,25739015.0,1.0,7739015.0,25739015.0,1.0,28377689.8,67417689.8,5.0,63987023.75,123987023.75,4.0,,,,,,,249359555.0,459359555.0,1.0,96207004.0,125207004.0,2.0,96207004.0,125207004.0,2.0,,,,96207004.0,125207004.0,2.0,,,,172819741.5,254819741.5,2.0,,,,128466744.0,193266744.0,5.0,,,56132340.79365079,19501388.41269841,5.75,3.6666666666666665,151278235.71911615

Conditions on Io are difficult: gravity is 1/6 that of Earth's with no breathable atmosphere, spacesuits are cumbersome, and miners carry their own air supply. Shifts are long, but significant bonuses are paid. Sheppard  boasts that since he took over the running of Io, productivity has broken all previous records. The film begins with a miner named Tarlow suffering an attack of delirium tremens ripping open his work-suit, resulting in his death by decompression. Later, another miner, Cane, goes outside without his spacesuit, and likewise dies from decompression. With the assistance of Dr. Lazarus , O'Niel investigates the deaths. However, another incident happens involving a worker, Sagan, who takes a prostitute hostage and threatens to kill her with a knife. O'Niel attempts to calm the man by the main door, while Montone , O'Niel's sergeant, sneaks in via the air duct. Montone kills Sagan with a shotgun before O'Niel can talk with him. O'Niel and Lazarus discover that all of the deaths had one thing in common, traces of an amphetamine-type drug in the bloodstream, allowing the miners to work continuously for days at a time, until they ""burn out"" and turn psychotic. O'Niel uncovers a drug distribution ring run by Sheppard and sanctioned by Montone. Using surveillance cameras, O'Niel finds and captures one of Sheppard's dealers, placing him in isolation. But before he can be questioned the dealer is killed. Montone is then found garroted. O'Niel does find and destroy the latest shipment of drugs which were hidden in a food shipment from the Jupiter space station. When Sheppard finds out what O'Niel did he calls in professional hitmen to kill him. O'Niel is ready, though, since he has been monitoring Sheppard's communications. At this point, the movie evolves into a High Noon scenario as O'Niel waits as a digital clock countdowns the time for the arrival of a shuttle from the space station on the other side of Jupiter. Knowing the assassins are on their way on the arriving shuttle, and with only Dr. Lazarus willing to help him, as his ""last act"" O'Niel sends a message to his wife and son, promising them that he will join them on the trip home to Earth. When the hit men arrive, O'Niel tracks them and ambushes each, killing them one by one. He is then confronted by Sheppard's ""inside man"", who turns out to be one of his own deputies, Sgt. Ballard. The two fight outside the base until O'Niel pulls Ballard's oxygen hose, suffocating him. O'Niel then confronts the surprised Sheppard in the base recreation bar, knocking him out with one punch. It is implied that Sheppard will now either be murdered by his own accomplices or brought to justice. O'Niel retires and leaves on the shuttle to join his wife and son on the trip back to Earth.jupiter husband wife relationship marshal wife dystopia mining cult film space centre",False,tt0082869,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,17374595,0,0,0.0859121875,4.391301574055172,53472904.0,58972904.0,,,,,70827202.1111111,19,77061091.0,9.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,7000000.0,19000000.0,1.0,53018260.333333336,61618260.333333336,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,48465900.5,56465900.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,110864174.33333333,131797507.66666667,3.0,93931801.0,104931801.0,1.0,39566922.0,43466922.0,2.0,111692319.0,112892319.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,77061091.0,70827202.1111111,2.375,9.0,59926399.23225083

Wendy asks to visit Never Land and Peter invites her to be the ""mother"" to his gang of Lost Boys . Before leaving, she asks to bring her brothers John  and Michael , and Peter teaches them all to fly with him. Out of jealousy, Tinker Bell  tricks the Lost Boys into shooting Wendy as she approaches the island, but Wendy survives and the boys ask her to be their mother and tell them stories. Two of the Lost Boys reveal to Peter that it was actually Tinkerbell who tricked them, and enraged by this, he breaks his friendship with her. Meanwhile, the Indian princess Tiger Lily  captures John and Michael by accident, just before Captain Hook  comes through the forest looking for the boys. Captain Hook captures Tiger Lily, John and Michael, and holds them as bait for Peter. All three of them are gagged and left hanging from a rock to drown as the tide rises. Peter and Hook engage in a duel and Hook manages to gain the upper hand when he disarms Peter and captures him momentarily. When Hook is about to kill Peter, the crocodile that ate Hook's hand appears, allowing Peter, Wendy and her brothers to escape. The Crocodile desperately tries to eat Hook by snapping his jaws around him, but he makes a narrow escape before the Crocodile can swallow him alive. That night, Peter shows Wendy the fairies home, Pixie Hollow, and share a romantic ""fairy dance."" While Hook spies on them, he is distressed that Peter has ""found himself a Wendy."" Peter reminds Wendy that they are just pretending to be a couple, and Wendy confronts Peter about his feelings about love. Peter becomes upset with her, and tells her to go home if she's not happy. Wendy, hurt, escapes to her little house. Peter returns to the Darling house, and seeing that Wendy's mother is still waiting for her children to come home, he attempts to shut the window to prevent her return to them. But, after a struggle, Wendy's parents manage to reopen the window, refusing to let it be closed. Hook later finds Wendy and has her carried to his ship, the Jolly Roger. There, he entices her with a job telling stories to the crew, then sends a spy to follow her to the Lost Boys' underground lair. The next day, after Peter hears of a new pirate, Wendy admits she was asked to serve as a crewman, which brings her to realise that they have forgotten their parents and must return home. Later, the pirates kidnap the boys as they are escorting the Darlings home, binding and gagging them as they leave the tree. Wendy finds out, but is gagged before she can cry out. Since Hook is unable to reach Peter, he leaves poison for him to drink when he wakes up. Tink stops him, poisoning herself in the process; Peter reaches out to children sleeping around the world, the Darlings, and even the pirates to sustain her with their belief in fairies. Peter and Tink save Wendy and the boys from walking the plank, and they all fight against the pirates. Hook sprinkles himself with Tink's fairy dust, and duels Peter in the air, weakening him with taunts about Wendy abandoning him and eventually forgetting about him when she grows up. Peter falls, unable to fight with those thoughts and gives in to inevitable death. But with a ""thimble""  from Wendy, Peter recovers and re-engages Hook, who loses his confidence and his altitude above the water, and is swallowed by the crocodile, much to his enjoyment as he has finally eaten Hook and got the full taste of him. Wendy decides that she belongs back home, and returns to London with her brothers and the Lost Boys. Peter, now with more respect for Wendy and her decision to return to London, heads back home to Neverland.  An alternative based on Barrie's epilogue is featured on the DVD, but with unfinished special effects and no music. In this version, Peter returns to the London house 20 years later, finding Wendy as a grown mother. He is deeply hurt when she tells him she has grown up, and walks over to Wendy's daughter, who is asleep in bed. His sobbing awakes the little girl, and she introduces herself as Jane. Peter grins excitedly at Wendy, and with her mother's permission, Jane flies away with Peter to Neverland as Wendy watches through the window after them.flying liberation fairy crocodile peter pan pirate gang mermaid pirate based on children's book fantasy world pirate ship",False,tt0316396,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,121975011,0,0,0.21975011,-14.415123713336484,80989651.0,172989651.0,,,72810877.76,107950877.76,,0,,,11830236.333333334,6.0,70163569.66666667,3.0,,0.0,,,-3548372.0,5.0,6451628.0,1.0,11540105.2,25.0,29140105.2,5.0,31931658.0,7.0,37831658.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25409756.75,39909756.75,4.0,,,,28049560.0,143049560.0,1.0,,,,61505388.0,156505388.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,35896740.21666667,12938406.883333333,5.375,2.5,79569518.43496008

Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor  , a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan . In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch , a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal  is threatened. Her husband Graham , mother Bernie , and brother Jimmy  implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored. She is given a nominal fine of IR£100, but while en route home she calls her mother and then her husband to report the good news. She is speaking to her office while stopped at traffic lights on red on the Naas Dual Carriageway when a motorcycle with two men on it pulls up beside her. The driver breaks the window of her car and then shoots her six times. The two flee and dispose of the bike and the gun in a nearby river. Guerin is mourned by her family, friends, associates and the country at large. Her violent death results in the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau and Gilligan together with several of his henchmen are tried and sentenced to lengthy gaol terms. In an epilogue, we learn that ""Veronica Guerin's writing turned the tide in the drug war. Her murder galvanised Ireland into action. Thousands of people took to the streets in weekly anti-drug marches, which drove the dealers out of Dublin and forced the drug barons underground. Within a week of her death, in an emergency session of the Parliament, the Government altered the Constitution of the Republic of Ireland to allow the High Court to freeze the assets of suspected drug barons.journalism dublin police drug scene based on a true story murder drug lord 1990s",True,tt0312549,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1569918,0,0,-9.828591047430503,-14.415123713336484,80989651.0,172989651.0,17740471.333333332,39740471.333333336,,,-3175926.0,6,10074074.0,2.0,-13029732.0,4.0,1970268.0,1.0,-10887043.0,6.0,1612957.0,1.0,14098211.0,14.0,14743391.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,103942062.0,183942062.0,2.0,,,,,,,11737911.0,23237911.0,1.0,,,,174868133.0,287368133.0,2.0,37473522.5,73973522.5,2.0,14098211.0,14743391.0,1.0,80989651.0,172989651.0,1.0,37494825.5,86994825.5,2.0,,,,264317794.0,289317794.0,1.0,21474200.25,40885495.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21474200.25,40885495.25,4.0,,,7100172.5,-3248622.5,3.75,1.25,79569518.43496008

The officer and building commander seals the room. During a routine transmission the outside tank patrol is attacked and destroyed. Almost immediately after the chopper patrol is attacked and crashes into the base, allowing the cyborg into the sealed room. The soldiers are no match for the cyborg and are killed one by one. At the last second Nabel deactivates the warrior with a remote control. They find out the cyborg warrior was created by their boss, E. J. Saggs and Nabel. After Saggs finds out about the remote, he has Nabel killed by one of the cyborgs. Keller, the trucker boss, is killed during a brawl on the space station. Truckers John, Cindy and Mike take a job delivering ""Sex dolls"" to Earth. They are aware that the cargo are not really sex dolls, but this is the only way they can get off of the station. John decides to go through the pirate controlled scum-zone; the truck is damaged and they are captured by the pirates. Cindy agrees to have sex with the pirate captain if he will take only their cargo and let them go. The Captain reveals himself to be Nabel, who survived Sagg's attempt on his life, but only as a badly built cyborg. One of the cyborgs breaks out of the containers and kills the pirates, giving Cindy a chance to escape and free John and Mike. They take off to Earth, but the wounded Nabel is on board with them. He tells John and Mike the truth about their cargo - when they get to Earth a large number of cyborgs will be set loose, effectively killing the entire population. John tells Cindy and Mike to take the escape pod and he will release the cargo in the atmosphere so it will burn up on reentry. He does so but his truck is destroyed too. Cindy and Mike decide to marry, and see Cindy's mother, who is surprisingly young and attractive. She became ill 20 years ago and was frozen until a cure was found. John is smitten with her. Within a few days Saggs has been elected World President. He visits the trio in the hospital and offers John a new truck and a suitcase full of money if the group will keep quiet about his cyborg plan. John agrees, but Mike is angry and throws the suitcase out of the window just as Saggs is getting in his limo. Saggs has planted a bomb in the case and pushes the detonator button just as it lands on the limo's roof, killing him. With Saggs dead and Earth safe, Mike, Cindy, John and Cindy's mother blast off in the brand new truck that Saggs gave them.killer robot space war dangerous state of emergency",True,tt0120199,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1614266,0,0,-14.486914795950605,-1.2635471289974909,,,13391971.111111112,29136415.555555556,,,-27084535.0,3,20915465.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,109773545.0,4.0,159773545.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,58769776.666666664,91436443.33333333,3.0,-7165743.333333333,9500923.333333334,3.0,-3148455.0,851545.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90344505.0,41344505.0,0.875,1.0,56576255.24926193

While scenes of Central Park are shown onscreen, Sean is heard lecturing to an unseen audience, explaining that he does not believe in reincarnation. After the lecture he goes jogging, collapses and dies. Ten years later, Anna has accepted a marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Joseph . When Clifford , Sean's brother, arrives at Anna's engagement party, his wife Clara  excuses herself, saying she forgot to wrap Anna's gift. Instead, she buys a replacement after hurriedly burying the gift while a young boy  secretly looks on. At a party for Anna's mother , the boy who followed Clara claims to be Anna's deceased husband, Sean, and warns her not to marry Joseph. At first Anna dismisses the boy's claim. When Anna receives a letter from him the next day warning her not to marry Joseph, she realizes the boy truly believes he is her reincarnated husband. That night Anna and Joseph discuss the letter. Since the building watchman seems to know the boy , Joseph calls to get more information. When Sean answers the phone, Joseph rushes downstairs to confront him. He takes him to Sean's father , and the three of them order Sean to leave Anna alone. Sean refuses to recant his story, and Anna watches Sean collapse in his father's arms. Sean leaves a message on Anna's answering machine, which her mother overhears. That day at lunch, Anna's mother mentions that Sean wants to meet Anna in the park, and that she will know where. Anna hurries to Central Park and finds Sean waiting in the spot where her husband died. He offers to submit to questioning. Anna's brother-in-law Bob , a doctor, talks to Sean, recording his responses on tape. He answers all the questions, even giving intimate details of Anna and Sean's sex life. Sean is brought to Anna's by his mother , and he is able to identify parts of the apartment. Everyone except Anna remains doubtful. Anna's family becomes worried, particularly her sister Laura , who treats Sean with contempt. When Anna misses an appointment with her fiance to spend time with Sean, Joseph begins feeling worried not merely about the boy, but about Anna's odd behavior. His jealousy is made plain when he physically attacks Sean. When Sean runs out, Anna follows him and kisses him on the lips. Anna seems convinced by the boy's story and asks Clara and Clifford to meet him. Clara encounters Sean at the door and asks him to visit her later. When he visits, he brings a backpack full of Anna's love letters to Sean. These were Clara's spiteful engagement gift which the boy secretly unearthed and read the night of the party. We learn that Clara was Sean's lover before his death, and that he gave the letters to her unopened as proof of his love. Clara was jealous that Sean would not leave Anna, but abandoned her plan to give Anna the letters. When Clara points out that if he were really a reincarnation of Sean he would have come to her first, Sean runs out, confused. When Anna finds Sean, she suggests they run away and marry when he is of legal age. He tells Anna that since he loves her he must not be the reincarnated Sean. Anna apologizes to Joseph, and they are married at the beach. Sean wrote a long letter apologizing to Anna, wondering why he had the delusion of being her husband. Anna wades into the sea in anguish after the ceremony. Joseph gradually pulls her back onto the sand and whispers into her ear.loss of loved one reincarnation friends little boy wedding",False,tt0337876,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,14603001,0,0,-0.3695814990357119,1.9257596443831189,,,5641263.4,14001263.4,4076331.6,23033931.6,87119842.2,9,141919842.2,5.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,6680836.0,1.0,16680836.0,1.0,,0.0,,,615787.0,8.0,1615787.0,1.0,40421927.0,8.0,50321927.0,2.0,,0.0,,,67006296.0,112006296.0,1.0,31274797.0,43274797.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,5858355.0,10158355.0,1.0,,,,-823150.75,32626849.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,38754374.666666664,65087708.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,52634598.05,33709598.05,3.25,2.25,84824632.31357588

However it turns out to be the wrong woman, Monica's roommate Hannah , and Tom likes her because she is so honest and doesn't fling herself at him. Ten years later, Hannah and Tom are best friends. Tom is very wealthy, because of his creation of the ""coffee collar"" and gets a dime every time it is used. Tom is with a different girl every week, while Hannah focuses on her career in an art museum. He is very content with his life, suspecting that Hannah is too. After Tom takes Hannah to his father's  sixth wedding, Hannah tells Tom she must go to Scotland for work. While she's gone, Tom discovers that without her, being with another woman week after week is not very fulfilling. He realizes that he loves Hannah, and decides to tell her his feelings when she gets back. Upon returning, Hannah surprisingly announces she is engaged to a wealthy Scot named Colin . Hannah asks Tom to be her maid of honor for her wedding. After discussing it with his friends, Tom decides to be her maid of honor, only to spend time with her and try to convince her she does not even know Colin, as well as making her realize that he loves her and she should be marrying him. After arriving in Scotland, at Eilean Donan Castle, for the wedding, Tom realizes he is running out of time to stop Hannah. He meets all of Colin's family and must perform in a variant of the Highland Games, in which the groom must compete to prove himself worthy of his bride. Tom is also in the competition with Colin, but loses in the last round. Tom takes Hannah out for a walk, hoping to tell her how he feels. However, the other bridesmaids interrupt for Hannah's bachelorette party. On her Hen Night, Hannah parades around a pub and sells her kisses for change. As she goes around, Hannah then kisses Tom. Though it just started as a peck on the cheek, it turns into a passionate kiss. That night, Hannah decides to confront Tom and ask about the kiss. However, when she gets to his room, her drunk cousin is there, trying to have sex with him. Hannah leaves and Tom runs after her. He knocks on her door, pleading for her to let him in. She refuses and asks about the kiss. He tells her he knew he was the one for her, not Colin. She refuses to say that she thinks so too and instead tells Tom that she still expects to marry Colin the next day. Tom cannot go through with watching Hannah and Colin get married so he decides to go home. When questioned about his sudden departure shortly before the wedding is to take place, Hannah informs Colin that Tom is just afraid of losing her. On the way home, Tom realizes that he must stop the wedding and goes back on horseback. Just when the priest asks for objections, Tom is sent flying off his horse and through the chapel doors. Seeing her best friend on the floor, Hannah rushes to him. As he struggles to stand up, he tells her that he loves her more than anything and that she should marry him. They then share a kiss. Hannah tells Colin that she is very sorry and that he is the perfect guy, just not the perfect guy for her. Colin's grandmother then tells Colin, in Scots language, to 'deck' Tom, which he does without hesitation. Hannah and Tom eventually get married. Melissa catches the bouquet and then links arms with Tom's dad, to which he says ""Number 6?"" and his lawyer says ""7"". The movie ends with Hannah and Tom on their honeymoon. Tom turns on the light just to see if he's got the right girl and Hannah replies ""You do"". The two kiss and as Hannah turns off the light, Tom says ""Oh, Monica"" and Hannah replies ""Oh, Bill"".scotland love of one's life ladykiller one-night stand bridesmaid forbidden love friends in love",False,tt0866439,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,84601681,0,0,1.115042025,-1.6278585820155915,38970801.541666664,62641634.875,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,988000.6666666666,12.0,41321334.0,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,20500000.0,38000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,52568752.75,112068752.75,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,58950639.0,70700718.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,16347115.285714285,35561401.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,41321334.0,988000.6666666666,1.5,3.0,95612307.5388973

After evading pursuers, Bond and M interrogate White regarding his organisation, Quantum. M's bodyguard, Mitchell, a double agent, attacks M, enabling White to escape. Bond chases Mitchell and kills him. Bond and M return to London and search Mitchell's flat, discovering through tagged banknotes that Mitchell had a contact in Haiti. Bond tracks the contact, Edmund Slate, and learns that Slate is a hitman sent to kill Camille Montes at the behest of her lover, environmentalist Dominic Greene. While observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns that Greene is helping an exiled Bolivian General, Medrano—who murdered Camille's family—to overthrow his government in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert. After rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a performance of Tosca in Bregenz, Austria. En route, the CIA head of the South American section, Gregg Beam, strikes a non-interference deal with Greene to maintain access to assumed stocks of Bolivian oil. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, and a gunfight ensues. A Special Branch bodyguard of Quantum member Guy Haines, an advisor to the British Prime Minister, is killed while in combat with Bond, and M—after Bond refuses to obey orders to return home and debrief—has his passports and credit cards revoked. Bond convinces his old ally René Mathis to accompany him to Bolivia. At the La Paz airport, they are greeted by Strawberry Fields, an MI6 officer, who demands that Bond return to the UK immediately; nonetheless, Bond soon seduces her before they attend a party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police working for Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put him in the boot of Bond's car to frame Bond; and, in the ensuing struggle, Mathis is killed. The following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is shot down after a brief air battle and they skydive out of the burning plane into a sinkhole. In the cave, Bond and Camille discover Quantum is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a monopoly. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns that Quantum murdered Fields by drowning her in crude oil. M orders Bond arrested for disobeying orders but he escapes. He risks capture by doubling back to tell M that Fields demonstrated bravery in the field, and this is enough to convince M that Bond can be trusted. Bond meets with CIA agent Felix Leiter, who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet in the Atacama Desert to finalise the coup. Warned by Leiter, he evades the CIA's Special Activities Division when they attempt to kill him. At the hotel, Greene and Medrano negotiate their terms. Greene then finally reveals his true plans: now that he controls the majority of Bolivia's water supply, Greene forces Medrano to accept a new contract that makes Greene Planet Bolivia's sole water utility company at significantly higher rates. Bond infiltrates the hotel, kills the Chief of Police for betraying Mathis, and confronts Greene. The hotel is destroyed during the ensuing struggle; Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her parents and sister, and Bond captures Greene. After interrogating him about Quantum, Bond leaves Greene stranded in the middle of the desert with only a can of engine oil. Bond and Camille kiss before they part. Bond travels to Kazan, Russia, where he finds Vesper Lynd's former lover, Yusef Kabira, with a new target, a Canadian agent. Yusef is a member of Quantum who seduces women with valuable connections. Bond decides not to kill Yusef and allows MI6 to arrest him. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found in the middle of the desert dead, shot twice and with engine oil in his stomach; Bond denies knowing anything. M also reveals that Leiter has been promoted and has taken Beam's place. She reinstates Bond as an agent; he tells M that he never left. As he leaves, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.killing undercover secret agent british secret service",False,tt0830515,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,586090727,1,0,1.930453635,-1.6278585820155915,165869008.19047618,206185674.85714287,88975937.83333333,122187771.16666667,39196036.72,63520036.72,126692477.2,5,198992477.2,5.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,118122357.1,19.0,151572357.1,10.0,258010647.33333334,7.0,360343980.6666667,3.0,449045960.0,2.0,599045960.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,449045960.0,599045960.0,1.0,51550820.0,119050820.0,2.0,,,,344939370.0,449939370.0,5.0,91766556.0,116766556.0,1.0,48363350.5,54863350.5,2.0,148180508.0,203122326.1818182,11.0,,,,297010915.6,415610915.6,5.0,,,,61286096.0,76286096.0,1.0,32523025.75,87273025.75,4.0,325607969.6666667,419274636.3333333,3.0,,,,230672076.0,383172076.0,2.0,449045960.0,599045960.0,1.0,95564739.0,150564739.0,2.0,40822316.4,93822316.4,5.0,222500000.0,262500000.0,1.0,153004335.2857143,241118621.0,7.0,,,,91766556.0,116766556.0,1.0,4954532.5,97454532.5,2.0,49238440.0,64238440.0,1.0,163965871.45454547,204086326.0,327488693.7416667,237967860.40833333,4.125,4.75,95612307.5388973

Richard orders him to take a castle that is rumoured to hold a gold statue. Discovering that it is defended by a solitary, one-eyed old man  who is sheltering harmless women and children, and convinced that there is no statue, Robin and his right-hand man, Little John , refuse to attack. King Richard, angry at their insubordination, orders the pair's execution, but before his orders can be carried out, he is mortally wounded by an arrow thrown by the old man. Richard has the helpless residents massacred, with the exception of the old man, because Richard likes his eye. The King asks Robin to pray for mercy for him. When Robin refuses, Richard draws his sword, but lacks the strength to strike him and falls to the floor. Robin helps him, and moved by his loyalty, with his last words, Richard frees Robin and Little John. After Richard's death, Robin and Little John return to England and are reunited with old friends Will Scarlet  and Friar Tuck  in Sherwood Forest. When Robin casually inquires about Maid Marian , they tell him she has become an abbess. When he goes to see her, she finds him as impossible as ever. He learns that his old nemesis, the Sheriff of Nottingham , has ordered her arrest in response to the King's order to expel senior leaders of the Roman Catholic Church from England. Marian wants no trouble, but Robin rescues her against her will, injuring Sir Ranulf , the Sheriff's arrogant guest, in the process. Ignoring the Sheriff's warnings, Sir Ranulf pursues Robin into the forest. His men are ambushed and decimated by arrows; Sir Ranulf is left unharmed only because Robin orders him spared. When the news of Robin's return spreads, old comrades and new recruits rally once more to him. Sir Ranulf asks King John for 200 soldiers to deal with Robin. The Sheriff waits in the open fields beyond the Forest, knowing Robin will attack. When Robin does, he proposes that he and the Sheriff duel to settle the issue, despite the protests of Sir Ranulf. Despite Robin appearing to have superior skills at the start of the fight, it soon becomes clear that the Sheriff is more than his match, and soon the Sheriff is dominating Robin in the fight. Eventually the Sheriff has the wounded Robin at his mercy and demands his surrender. Refusing, Robin manages to kill the Sheriff with the last of his strength. Led by Sir Ranulf, the soldiers attack and scatter Robin's ragtag band, many of whom are captured or killed. Little John swiftly kills Sir Ranulf. Then he and Marian take Robin to her abbey where she tells Robin she keeps her medicine. Robin believes he will recover to win future battles. Little John stands guard outside while Marian tends to Robin's wounds. Marian prepares a draft and takes a drink of it herself before giving it to Robin. He drinks the medicine and notes that the pain has gone away and his legs have gone numb. Then, realising that she has poisoned them both, he cries out for Little John. However, he comes to understand that Marian has acted out of love because he would never be the same man again. She tells him: I love you. More than all you know. I love you more than children. More than fields I've planted with my hands. I love you more than morning prayers or peace or food to eat. I love you more than sunlight, more than flesh or joy, or one more day. I love you...more than God. Little John crashes through the door and weeps at Robin&#39;s bedside. Robin shoots an arrow from his deathbed through the open window and tells Little John to bury them both where it lands. There is no indication of it ever falling.england crusade robin hood 12th century king richard",False,tt0075147,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,8000000,0,0,0.6,8.682732696668719,,,22900549.0,28125549.0,,,86527831.28571428,14,90685688.42857143,7.0,,0.0,,,50674382.5,13.0,53624382.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,89553289.0,95015789.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,11739668.0,12299668.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29744718.0,41744718.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,72155035.46428572,68601106.89285713,3.375,4.5,68228109.06047031

Much to their frustration, Murnau keeps his team very much in the dark about their schedule, and even more so about the actor he has found to play the part of the vampire Count Orlok. It is left to the film's other main actor, Gustav von Wangenheim  to explain to them that the mysterious lead is apparently an obscure German theater performer named Max Schreck , who, according to Murnau, is a highly professional character actor. In order to involve himself fully in his role, Schreck will only appear among the cast and crew in full make-up, and will never break character. After filming the beginning scenes of his film in a sound stage with his leading actress, Greta Schroeder  who is incredibly displeased about having to leave Berlin, Murnau and his team travel to the remote inn where they will be staying and shooting further scenes for the picture. During their stay, however, the landlady becomes distressed at Murnau removing many of the crucifixes around the inn, and the cameraman, Wolfgang Muller  begins to fall in to a strange, hypnotic state. Further strange things happen as Gustav discovers a bottle of blood in amongst the team's food supplies, and Murnau delivers a caged ferret to a derelict cellar in the middle of the night, apparently as food for a strange creature. One night, Murnau rushes his team up to the main setting for his film, an old Slovak castle, for the first scene with the vampire. Schreck appears to them for the first time, and his appearance and behavior both impress and disturb them. The film's producer, Albin Grau  however, suspects that Schreck is not really a German theater actor, and is confused when Murnau tells him that he in fact found Schreck in the old castle. Soon after the completion of the scene, Wolf is found collapsed in a dark tunnel. Upon returning to the inn, the landlady appears frightened by his pale, weak appearance, and mutters ""Nosferatu"" while clutching at a rosary. The next night, Murnau and his team continue filming up at the castle, and the tension between Murnau and his star begins to show. Whilst filming a dinner scene between Gustav and Count Orlok, Murnau deliberately startles Gustav, making him cut his finger with a bread knife. Schreck reacts wildly at the sight of the blood, and, urged on by Murnau, tries to drink from Gustav's wound. The rest of the crew look on in horror, when suddenly, the generator powering the lights fails, plunging everything in to darkness. When the lights come back on again, Murnau is furious to find Schreck pinning Wolf to the floor, apparently draining his blood. Albin orders filming to end for the night, and the crew rushes from the castle, carrying Wolf and leaving Schreck behind. Left alone, Schreck curiously examines some of the camera equipment, and appears fascinated and entranced by some footage of a sunrise. It is revealed that Schreck is in fact a true vampire who Murnau has made a deal with, in order to create the most realistic vampire film possible. Schreck has been promised Greta as a prize for completeing his role in the film, but he remains difficult and uncooperative with the fanatical Murnau, until the entire production is at his mercy, and in danger of ruin. With Wolf close to death, Murnau is forced to bring in another cinematographer from Berlin, Fritz Arno Wagner  in order to continue filming. During Murnau's absence, Albin and the film's scriptwriter, Henrik Galeen  share a drink together by a campfire, when Schreck approaches them. They invite him to join them, and begin to question Schreck  about the accuracy of the Dracula novel. Schreck  points out the flaw of the centuries old Count Dracula still being able to remember how to do everyday 'human' activities, such as preparing a meal, even though he hasn't eaten food in centuries. He tells Albin and Henrik that he himself is so old, he cannot remember how he became a vampire  and cannot create more of his own kind. A bat flies by and Schreck catches it with a quick hand, sucking its blood, ecstatically from its body. The others are left stunned and impressed by what they still assume is talented acting. The troubled production is eventually left stranded on an island in the middle of the North Sea, and Murnau, in a drug-induced stupor, admits to Albin and Fritz Schreck's true nature. The two of them realise that they have no choice but to complete the film and give Greta to the vampire in the last scene if they wish to leave the island alive. When an unsuspecting Greta arrives for filming, however, she notices that Schreck casts no reflection in a mirror. Murnau, Albin, and Fritz are forced to drug her, and Schreck feeds on her while the others film the scene. At dawn, with Greta nearly dead, the remaining three attempt to let sunlight in to the building to destroy Schreck, but find that he has anticipated their trickery. Schreck kills both Fritz and Albin while Murnau  continues to operate the camera. However, the rest of the crew arrive in time to open up the doors and flood the set with sunlight, finally destroying Schreck while Murnau films his death. Murnau completes the filming and calmly states ""I think we have it"", while his rescuers look on at the carnage.movie business nosferatu",True,tt0189998,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,8279017,0,0,0.034877125,-1.1627692044360227,6363850.5,16363850.5,,,,,41503749.25,16,63603749.25,4.0,108454567.33333333,14.0,124454567.33333333,3.0,11682170.0,4.0,36682170.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-7853917.0,2.0,146083.0,1.0,-4686356.0,2.0,4313644.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-18319657.0,7930343.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,45840042.71666667,29820042.716666665,4.75,2.0,76394553.2193505

Several years later, the Marquis is confined to the asylum at Charenton, overseen by the enlightened Abbé du Coulmier. The Marquis has been publishing his work through laundress Madeleine ""Maddy"" LeClerc, who smuggles manuscripts through an anonymous horseman to a publisher. The Marquis' latest work, Justine, is published on the black market to great success. Napoleon orders all copies of the book burned and the author shot, but his advisor, Delbené, tempers this contentious idea with one of his own: send traditionalist Dr. Royer-Collard to look in at Charenton and silence the Marquis. Meanwhile the Abbé teaches Madeleine to read and write and resists his growing attraction to her. Dr. Royer-Collard arrives, informing the Abbé that the Marquis' ""therapeutic writings"" have been distributed for public consumption. Horrified, the Abbé rejects Royer-Collard's offers of several archaic ""treatments"" and asks to speak with the Marquis himself, who promptly swears obedience . Royer-Collard takes his leave for the time being and travels to the Panthemont Convent in Paris to retrieve his promised bride, the underage Simone. They are given a run-down chateau by the Emperor, with a handsome young architect, Prouix, on hand for its renovation. The hasty marriage incites much gossip at the asylum, prompting the Marquis to write a farce to be performed at a public exhibition. The audacious play, titled ""The Crimes of Love"", is interrupted when the inmate Bouchon (British character actor molests Madeleine off-stage, prompting her to hit him in the face with an iron. Royer-Collard shuts down the public theater and demands that the Abbé do more to control the Marquis. Infuriated, the Abbé confiscates the Marquis' quills and ink, prompting more subversive behavior, including a story written in wine on bedsheets and in blood on clothing. This results in further deprivation, eventually leaving the Marquis naked in an empty cell. One of the maids reveals that Madeleine has been helping the Marquis. Madeleine is whipped on the order of Dr. Royer-Collard until the Abbé stops him by offering himself instead and declaring that she will be sent away. That night she visits his chamber to beg him to reconsider sending her away and confesses her love for him in the process, prompting him to kiss her passionately. He abruptly breaks away at the realization of what he is doing. Madeleine is angry with him the next day and the Abbé is shown as sexually frustrated. While this is occurring at the asylum, Simone has been violently introduced to the adult world by her husband. She unrepentantly purchases a copy of the Marquis de Sade's Justine, seduces Prioux, and the young lovers run off together. She leaves behind a letter explaining her actions and her copy of Justine. Upon finding this, Dr. Royer-Collard seizes on the Marquis as the source of his troubles and embarks upon a quest for revenge. About to be sent away from Charenton for her role in assisting the Marquis, Madeleine begs a last story from him, which is to be relayed to her through the asylum patients. Bouchon, the inmate at the end of the relay, is excited by the story, breaks out of his cell, and kills Madeleine. The asylum is set afire by the pyromaniac Dauphin and the inmates break out of their cells. Madeleine's body is found by her blind mother and the Abbé in the laundry vat. The Abbé is completely devastated by Madeleine's death and Bouchon is captured and imprisoned inside an iron dummy. The Abbé blames the Marquis for Madeleine's death and prods him into a fury. The Marquis claims he had been with Madeleine in every way imaginable, only to be told she had died a virgin. The Abbé cuts out the Marquis' tongue as punishment for his involvement. In a later scene, the Abbé has sex with the corpse of Madeline in a dream. The Marquis' health declines severely, though perverse as ever, he decorates his oubliette with a story, using feces as ink. As the Abbé finishes reading the last rites, he offers the Marquis a crucifix to kiss, which he swallows and chokes on, thus committing suicide. A year later, the new Abbé du Maupas arrives at Charenton and is given the grand tour. The asylum has been converted into a print shop, with the inmates as its staff. The books being printed are the works of the Marquis de Sade. At the end of the tour, the new Abbé meets his predecessor, who resides in the Marquis' old cell. Yearning to write, he begs paper and a quill from the Abbé, who is herded off by Royer-Collard, now overseer of the asylum. However, the peephole opens, and Madeleine's mother thrusts paper, quill, and ink through. The Abbé begins to scribble furiously, with the Marquis providing the narration.{{cite web}}paris, france asylum french revolution french smuggling based on play or musical maid marquis de sade 19th century",False,tt0180073,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,7060876,0,0,-0.911944070395798,-1.1627692044360227,,,14814469.5,22564469.5,,,264317794.0,2,289317794.0,1.0,33705815.333333336,5.0,47372482.0,3.0,177962470.5,5.0,239462470.5,2.0,16345744.333333334,36.0,26845744.333333332,3.0,33611490.0,28.0,36761490.0,2.0,104280263.0,0.0,109280263.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,184299028.5,199299028.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,45929080.333333336,65429080.333333336,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,264317794.0,289317794.0,1.0,,,,,,,264317794.0,289317794.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,15057824.923076924,38534748.0,13.0,,,124840040.6388889,105037262.8611111,9.5,2.0,76394553.2193505

Their target is 2,000 British soldiers marooned on the island of Kheros in the Aegean Sea. Rescue by the Royal Navy is impossible because of massive radar-directed guns on the nearby island of Navarone. Time is short, because the Germans are expected to launch an assault on the British forces. Efforts to destroy the guns by aerial bombing have proved fruitless. So that six destroyers can pick up the stranded men, Commodore Jensen  of Allied Intelligence gathers a team of commandos to sail to Navarone and destroy the guns. Led by Major Roy Franklin , they are Captain Keith Mallory , renowned mountaineer; Colonel Andrea Stavrou , from the defeated Greek army; Franklin's best friend Corporal Miller , a former University Chemistry teacher and explosives expert; Greek-American Spyros Pappadimos , a native of Navarone; and ""Butcher"" Brown , an engineer and expert knife fighter. Disguised as Greek fishermen on a decrepit boat, they sail across the Aegean Sea. They are intercepted by a German boat and boarded. They attack and kill all the Germans and sink the patrol boat. During the remainder of the voyage, Mallory confides to Franklin that Andrea has sworn to kill him after the war, because he was inadvertently responsible for the deaths of Andrea's wife and children. In a violent storm, the ship is wrecked and they lose part of their equipment but still manage to land on the island. Led by Mallory, who was recruited for his climbing skills, they scale the ""unclimbable"" cliff. But Franklin is badly injured; the injury later becoming infected with gangrene. They find that the cliff is, in fact, guarded after all. Miller suggests that they leave Franklin to be ""well cared for"" by the enemy. Mallory, who assumes command of the mission, feels that Franklin would be forced to reveal their plans, so he orders two men to carry the injured man on a stretcher. Franklin tries to commit suicide, but Mallory lies to him, saying that their mission has been ""scrubbed"" and that a major naval attack will be mounted on the side of the island opposite the gun emplacement. They rendezvous with local resistance fighters, Spyros's sister Maria  and her friend Anna , who was captured, tortured, and escaped. She was so traumatized that she cannot speak and will not allow even Maria to see her scars. The mission is continually dogged by German soldiers, and the group is captured by Oberleutnant Muesel  in the town of Mandrakos, when they try to find a doctor for Franklin. Muesel and Hauptsturmführer Sessler  of the SS fail to persuade the saboteurs to tell them where Miller's explosives are. Andrea pretends to grovel and beg for mercy, which surprises the Germans, allowing the group to overpower their captors. They escape in German uniform but leave Franklin behind to receive medical attention. In due course, Franklin is injected with scopolamine and gives up the false ""information"", as Mallory had hoped. German units are deployed in the direction of the supposed invasion point, away from the guns. Miller discovers that most of his explosives have been rendered useless and deduces that Anna is the saboteur. It transpires that she is not mute after all and was only threatened with torture but agreed to become an informer in exchange for her release. She pleads that she was coerced; but Miller, bitter about the way that Mallory has ""abandoned"" Franklin, insists she must be silenced. While the men hem and haw at the thought of killing an unarmed woman, it is Maria who shoots her dead. The team splits up: Mallory and Miller go for the guns, while Andrea and Pappadimos create a distraction in the town; Maria and Brown are assigned to steal a boat for their escape. Mallory and Miller make their way to the heavily fortified gun emplacements. Locking the main entrance behind them—which sets off an alarm—Miller sets obvious explosives on the guns and hides more below an elevator leading to the guns. The Germans cut through the thick emplacement doors, as Mallory and Miller make their escape by diving into the sea, reaching the stolen boat. Pappadimos and Brown are dead, and Andrea is wounded. Mallory saves him, pulling him into the boat; thus voiding the ""blood feud"" between them. The Allied destroyers appear on schedule. The Germans find the explosives planted on the guns and begin to fire on the passing Allied flotilla. The first salvo falls short. The second brackets the lead ship. However, just as the guns are prepared to fire again, the elevator descends low enough to trigger the hidden explosives. The guns and fortifications are destroyed in a spectacular explosion that Franklin hears from his hospital bed. As the ruined guns fall into the sea, the destroyers sound off their horns in celebration. Andrea, who has fallen in love with Maria, decides to return to Navarone with her. Mallory and Miller observe the aftermath of the destruction from a destroyer.based on novel or book world war ii fort allies army",False,tt0054953,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,28900000,0,0,3.816666666666667,4.8153065287331085,,,41908000.0,44908000.0,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-953079.0,46921.0,1.0,,,,41908000.0,44908000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,78661448.5806271

They call themselves The Dandies. Their club is assembled from the young misfits in a fictional small American mining town, Electric Park. It is started after the main character, Dick Dandelion , buys what he thinks is a toy gun as a gift. His co-worker tells him the gun is real, and the two start shooting and studying in their spare time. They later recruit other outcasts, young men  who do not, or cannot, work in the mine, including one boy in leg braces and his younger brother Freddie. The film is framed by Dick's voiceover, resembling a love letter to his gun Wendy. He is the leader of the group , and tells them that their group is a ""social experiment"" and will reveal their true nature. The script shares characteristics with earlier von Trier scripts, depicting violence and race relations in the United States in a highly stylized, exaggerated manner and mixing realistic and fantastic elements. Though more substantial than the bare sound stage of Dogville, Electric Park is reminiscent of a western set on the back lot of a movie studio. The Dandies spend most of their time on this one block or in an abandoned mining shaft that they decorate and call the Temple. The Dandies have several quirks and idiosyncratic rules. A Dandy may never brandish his weapon in public, but instead gains self-confidence simply knowing he is carrying a concealed weapon. As a badge of membership, they cultivate a 'Brideshead Stutter' . They refuse to say the word 'killing' and instead refer to it as 'loving.' They live up to their name, Dandies, by dressing in colourful, outdated clothing, including vests, long jackets and hats. Though they regularly shoot targets , they spend just as much time playing gun-related games, watching instructional videos and studying diagrams. They use their own personal guns, all antiques with names and back stories, more as props than weapons. Even when they do load and shoot their weapons, they favour style over function . Most of the characters in the film are white, save for two: Clarabelle, Dick's loving childhood nanny, and her grandson Sebastian. Sebastian shows up at Dick's house one day with the town sheriff . He has been put on probation for a weapons-related crime  and has to regularly check in with Dick, whom the sheriff judges to be a good role model. The irony being that Dick and the Dandies spend all of their time using guns. Dick allows Sebastian to break probation and asks him to join the Dandies (Dick sees it as a bit of a [[Pygmalion , but only if he does everything on their terms. One day, Sebastian gives them a suspicious box full of guns, and soon breaks a club rule by firing another member's gun. Dick complains that Sebastian is ""ruining it for everyone."" The group's sole female member, Susan , takes a shine to Sebastian and this threatens Dick. Freddie suggests that she likes ""big schlongs."" Like Dick, she lost a parent early on in the film though it doesn't seem to disturb her. Most of the film plays out like a child's game of cops and robbers or cowboys and Indians, and most of the non-Dandies portrayed are police officers and faceless miners. Sebastian's natural manner is in stark contrast to the affectations of the Dandies, especially the awkward poetry of Dick's voiceover. He speaks like a regular teenager and seems out of place in the one-block world of Electric Park. He points out their oddities, including their strange clothing. He is an outsider among outsiders, but still enlisted in the group. Sebastian tells Dick that he and his friends carry guns because they're scared, that everyone is scared. He tells them that his grandmother, Dick's former nanny, is too scared of ""the gangs"" to even leave her home . Like a good Boy Scout, Dick devises a sort of war plan for assisting Clarabelle on her yearly visit to her cousin's. He believes it is the ""decent American"" thing to do. The Dandies accompany Clarabelle on her walk, but she becomes panicked when they encounter a deputy sheriff. There is a scuffle, he tries to help out and the old lady ends up shooting the deputy. The sheriff asks the Dandies to hand over Clarabelle, even telling them they can keep their guns if they do so. He tells the boys that they are what the country is made of. The Dandies notice his automatic gun, which Dick calls ""treacherous,"" and sense that they are being set up just as several other police officers appear. The Dandies flee to the Temple to hide. Now outlaws, the Dandies decide to take Clarabelle to her cousin's once and for all. Their decision is based more on principle than practicality, and it is clear that they are willing to martyr themselves. They treat it as a suicide mission, cutting themselves ceremonially and donning their fanciest clothes. Sebastian discovers Dick's now-finished letter to Wendy, which ends with the coded threat: ""And now, it's the time of the season for loving"" . They head outside one by one, armed, to face the team of shotgun-toting police officers assembled by a legion of squad cars. The first to go, Huey , tells them ""We're not interested in shooting anybody, so don't make us."" The Marshall arrives and tells Huey to ""Drop the pathetic gun right this minute."" He is promptly shot by Huey, who smiles and announces ""Officer d-d-down I'm afraid!"" before hobbling into gunfire. Huey discovers that he can walk fine without his crutches just as he's gunned down. Meanwhile, a bullet ricochets and hits Clarabelle in the leg as the Dandies continue attempting to escort her to her cousin's house . Dick realizes that there is a sniper in their midst and sets on shooting the offender down. Susan is the next to shoot, using both of her guns and her carefully honed ricochet method. All the while, white lines and numbers on the screen graphically depicting the trajectories of the Dandies' shots. Susan is shot in the head. Stevie and his gun Badsteel come to her defence and he is shot in the heart. Sebastian asks Dick ""What happened?"" and a series of morgue photographs flash across the screen. Only Sebastian, Dick and Freddie remain. The three attempt to drag Clarabelle to safety. Freddie is the next to go. He has tied a cord around his testicles, a tactic with roots in Native American history that he championed earlier on, and grabs his crotch before getting up and firing. He is quickly shot down, rises, then is shot several more times. Clarabelle stirs and Dick is hit as he comes to her aid, though he manages to get her all the way to her cousin's house. While he is inside, police officers are scanning the windows and lining him up in their guns' sights. Sebastian remains outside, unharmed and hidden by the door of a police car. He sees Dick's gun, the one he called Wendy, lying in the street and recalls a line of Dick's letter: ""Dear Wendy, I always dreamed that if someone were to make that final exit wound in me, it should be you. My saviour."" He grabs the gun and then runs inside the home of his grandmother's cousin. He goes upstairs and shoots Dick in the back, mouthing ""Dick, [unknown]?"" Dick resembles a pilgrim as he turns around in his buckle hat. His life, at least that which was contained by the film, flashes before his eyes. He examines the exit wound and whispers ""Wendy."" The police on the roof across the street shoot up the windows and, mostly likely, Sebastian. All the while, the ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"" plays in the background. The film features many tracks by the 1960s pop-rock band The Zombies, including ""She's Not There"", ""Time of the Season"". Dick's final words to Wendy in his letter, ""it's the time of the season for loving"" is a quote from the latter song.underdog secret society friendship west virginia pacifist self esteem",True,tt0342272,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,446438,0,0,-16.919621537593127,-2.6760407675788414,16956357.5,28356357.5,,,,,47921531.5,5,55421531.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,104280263.0,109280263.0,1.0,-1737920.4,29022079.6,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6680836.0,16680836.0,1.0,,,,-18799577.5,37600422.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,42200360.5,49700360.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,55421531.5,47921531.5,0.625,2.0,109858494.28372188

The film focuses on three particular species, the polar bear, African bush elephant and humpback whale. Starting in the high Arctic in January, as the darkness of winter gives way to the sun, a mother polar bear is shown emerging from her den with two new cubs. She needs food and must lead her cubs to her hunting ground on the sea ice before it begins to break up. By April, the sun never sets, and by August all the sea ice has melted. The mother and cubs have retreated to dry land, but a male polar bear is trapped at sea and must seek out land by swimming. He reaches an island with a walrus colony but is too exhausted to make a successful kill. He dies from injuries sustained in a walrus attack. African bush elephants are filmed from the air as they negotiate a dust storm in the Kalahari Desert. June is the dry season and they must follow ancient paths passed down through generations to reach watering holes. A mother and calf are separated from the herd in the storm but manage to reach shelter. The matriarch leads the herd to a temporary watering hole, but they must share it with hungry lions and scavenger White-backed Vultures. The lions are shown attacking a solitary elephant at night, when their superior vision gives them the upper hand. The herd times its arrival at the Okavango Delta to coincide with seasonal floodwaters which transform the desert into a lush water world. A humpback whale mother and calf are filmed from the air and underwater at their breeding grounds in the shallow seas of the tropics. There is nothing here for the mother to eat, so she must guide her calf on a {{convert}} journey south to the rich feeding grounds near Antarctica, the longest migration of any marine mammal. En route, they negotiate dangerous seas where great white sharks are filmed breaching as they hunt. Sea lions, and sailfish and dolphins combine to bait a shoal of small fish. By October they enter polar waters, and by December the Antarctic sun has melted the sea ice to form sheltered bays. Here, the whales are shown feeding on krill by trapping them in bubble nets. The stories of these individual creatures are woven into the film alongside a great many additional scenes. The supporting cast of animals include mandarin ducklings filmed jumping from their tree hole nest, Arctic wolves hunting caribou, cheetah hunting Thomson's gazelle, elephants charge at White-backed Vulture, birds of paradise displaying in the New Guinea rainforest, Adelie Penguins in the Antarctic and demoiselle cranes on their autumn migration across the Himalayas. Time-lapse photography is used to show the blossoming of spring flowers, seasonal changes to deciduous forests, clouds sweeping up Himalayan valleys and the growth of jungle spores and fungi.ocean himalaya ice walrus nature antarctic",False,tt0393597,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,109000000,1,0,6.2666666666666675,-6.117028646878049,,,-39808601.0,7191399.0,19433218.25,54633218.25,86643512.33333333,26,168643512.33333334,3.0,,0.0,,,7640272.0,43.0,9440272.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12325062.5,30741729.166666668,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,89041892.16666667,47141892.166666664,11.5,2.0,105980128.20199434

He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell , whose husband, Walter ([[Richard Thomas , is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending - the book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. His students include James Leer  and Hannah Green . Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Tripp's large house, is attracted to Tripp, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy. Meanwhile, Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree , has flown into town on the pretense of attending the university's annual WordFest, a literary event for aspiring authors. In reality, Crabtree is there to see if Tripp has written anything worth publishing, as both men's careers depend on Grady's upcoming book. Terry arrives with a transvestite whom he met on the flight, called Antonia Sloviak . The pair apparently become intimate in a bedroom at the Gaskells' party, but immediately afterwards Terry meets, and becomes infatuated with, James when Sloviak is unceremoniously sent home. After a night on the town, Crabtree and James semi-consciously flirt throughout the night, which eventually leads up to the two spending an intimate night together in one of Grady's spare rooms. Tired and confused, Grady phones Walter and reveals to him that he is in love with Walter's wife. Meanwhile, Walter has also made the connection between the disappearance of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia and James. The following morning the Pittsburgh Police arrive with Sara to escort James to the Chancellor's office to discuss the ramifications of his actions. The memorabilia is still in Grady's car, which has conspicuously gone missing. This car had been given to him by a friend as payment for a loan, and over the weekend Grady has come to suspect that the car was stolen. Over the course of his travel around town, Grady has been repeatedly accosted by a man claiming to be the car's real owner. He eventually tracks the car down, but in a dispute over its ownership the majority of his manuscript blows out of the car and is lost. The car's owner gives him a ride to the university with his wife, Oola, in the passenger seat, with the stolen memorabilia. Grady finally sees that making things right involves having to make difficult choices. Grady tells Oola the story behind the memorabilia and allows her to leave with it. Worried that Grady's choice comes at the expense of damaging James' future, Crabtree convinces Walter not to press charges by agreeing to publish his book, ""a critical exploration of the union of Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe and its function in American mythopoetics"", tentatively titled The Last American Marriage. The film ends with Grady recounting the eventual fate of the main characters - Hannah graduates and becomes a magazine editor; James wasn't expelled, but drops out and moves to New York with Crabtree to rework his novel for publication; and Crabtree himself ""goes right on being Crabtree."" Grady finishes typing his new novel , then watches Sara and their child arriving home before turning back to the computer and clicking ""Save.""gay adultery robbery based on novel or book pennsylvania, usa infidelity professor college police party liar marijuana writer university drugs dog bisexual man pittsburgh, pennsylvania",False,tt0185014,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,33422485,0,0,-0.04719921334395093,-1.1627692044360227,-5992663.0,23435908.42857143,,,8902500.0,14302500.0,,0,,,,0.0,,,53611975.0,4.0,60611975.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-5000666.0,5.0,4199334.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,29732431.25,64732431.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32405654.5,24305654.5,1.125,1.0,76394553.2193505

A short time later, he is seen accosting the captain of a merchant ship, asking that the shipment he has sent back to Chicago be unloaded from the ship. When the captain informs him that it's too late because the ship is about to leave, Whitney sneaks aboard. As the ship leaves the dock, Whitney searches through the cargo hold for his crates, crying out in despair when he does not find what he's looking for. Six weeks later, the ship arrives on the Illinois River, with its crew missing. Chicago PD homicide detective Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta  is assigned to investigate the ship. His partner, Sgt. Hollingsworth  is sure that the crew's disappearance is drug-related, but Lt. D'Agosta opens the bilge hatch and finds dozens of bodies and severed heads inside. Dr. Margo Green , an evolutionary biologist, arrives at work at the Museum, which is planning a gala opening of its latest ""Superstition"" exhibition. She and her mentor, Dr. Frock  examine Whitney's crates, which are curiously empty, except for a bed of leaves used as packing materials and a stone statue of the ""Kothoga,"" a mythical forest monster. Noticing a strange fungus growing on some of the leaves, Margo decides to save some for analysis. That night, security guard Fred Ford is gruesomely murdered in the same manner as the ship's crew. Lt. D'Agosta investigates the murder and puzzles over a possible connection. Since he believes the killer may still be inside the Museum, he orders it closed until the police have finished searching, despite the protests of museum director, Dr. Cuthbert  about the upcoming opening. Margo analyzes the fungus and finds that it is loaded with concentrated hormones found in several animal species. Opening the container of leaves, she finds a beetle that crawled inside and has grown to a freakishy large size. The autopsy of Fred Ford reveals the bizarre fact that the killer tore open his skull and extracted the hypothalamus from his brain. An examination of the bodies from the ship reveals the same condition. Lt. D'Agosta is not sure what to make of this, but then the police teams find a derelict hiding in the Museum's basement, who is shot to death when he attacks the officers. When the derelict is found to be a convicted felon, with a history of mental illness, and has Ford's wallet in his pocket, everyone except Lt. D'Agosta considers the case closed, but the lieutenant has to give in when the Mayor of Chicago orders him to let the gala opening go on. On the night of the opening, Lt. D'Agosta insists on sealing all areas of the museum except the main exhibition hall, while doing one last search of the basement tunnels. Dr. Frock and Margo are the last ones in the laboratory wing, and are unfortunately trapped inside when the wing is sealed . In the basement, Lt. D'Agosta and his officers are attacked by something in the dark. The lieutenant tells Hollingsworth to run back to the main hall and evacuate the museum, but it is too late: the headless body of a murdered police officer tumbles from an air conditioning vent into the heart of the crowd, causing a panic. In their hysterical rush out of the museum, all the museum's alarms are tripped and their security system goes haywire, closing the fire doors and trapping a small group of people inside, just as the power fails. Alone, Lt. D'Agosta finds his way to the lab wing, and discovers Margo and Dr. Frock. All three of them are then attacked by their antagonist: the real Kothoga, an enormous chimeric beast. They barely manage to close a steel door between it and them, while the monster wounds itself trying to batter through. Margo theorizes that the Kothoga must have been some much smaller animal that mutated after eating the fungal leaves that she found in John Whitney's packing crates. Dr. Frock excitedly expands on her hypothesis: without the leaves to eat, the Kothoga's closest substitute for the hormones contained in them is to extract and eat human hypothalami. The tribe that Whitney was studying must have discovered the properties of these leaves, and used them to turn an animal into a weapon of war, that would eventually die when it had no more humans to kill. Lt. D'Agosta finds a radio and orders Hollingsworth to lead the trapped museum guests to an old coal tunnel that will allow them to escape. A few guests refuse to go, preferring to wait for the fire doors to be opened from the outside. But the Kothoga returns to the main hall and murders these guests, as well as several S.W.A.T. officers entering through the skylights. Margo analyzes the Kothoga's blood and guesses that, since it is at least part-reptilian, it is probably cold-blooded and they can kill it with liquid nitrogen. She and Lt. D'Agosta collect the remaining leaves from Margo's lab, but discover that Dr. Frock has already been killed by the creature. Making their way to the sewer underneath the museum, Lt. D'Agosta baits a trap with the leaves, luring the Kothoga away from the party escaping via the coal tunnel, who successfully escape the museum. But liquid nitrogen has no effect on the Kothoga, and Margo and D'Agosta flee back to the lab wing. Over her protests, Lt. D'Agosta tells her to lock herself inside, while he stays behind to stop the creature. As she pleads with him, her computer signals that it has completed the analysis of the Kothoga's DNA: the Kothoga was not sent back by John Whitney; it is John Whitney, mutated after innocently drinking a soup made from the leaves, fed to him by the hostile tribesmen. Just as she realizes this, the Kothoga smashes into the lab through the ceiling, while the lieutenant is trapped on the other side of the door. Margo runs through the lab, chased by the creature, and manages to start an explosive fire that destroys it, while she survives by climbing inside a maceration tank and pulling the cover shut over herself. As dawn comes, Lt. D'Agosta and a team of police break into the lab, see the charred remains of the Kothoga, and rescue Margo from the tank.chicago, usa based on novel or book monster museum pile of dead bodies god dead body anthropologist indian tribe amazon jungle",True,tt0120004,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,33956608,0,0,-0.7669609402682388,-0.16960090051826512,,,-8644622.75,11355377.25,17363572.111111112,28974683.222222224,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,37000000.0,42000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1374595.0,17374595.0,1.0,,,,-3080347.0,1919653.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1374595.0,17374595.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,107279251.96773516

He is taken to the Schloß Adler, a fortress high in the Alps of southern Bavaria. A team of commandos, led by Major Jonathan Smith  and U.S. Army Ranger Lieutenant Morris Schaffer , is briefed by Colonel Wyatt Turner  and Admiral Rolland  of MI6. Their mission is to parachute in, infiltrate the castle, and rescue General Carnaby before the Germans can interrogate him. MI6 Agent Mary Elison  accompanies the mission in secret, her presence known only to Major Smith. Early in the mission, two of the sergeants, MacPherson ([[Neil McCarthy  and radio operator Harrod , are mysteriously killed; but Major Smith is unperturbed, keeping Lt. Schaffer as a close ally and secretly updating Admiral Rolland on developments by radio, using the call sign ""Broadsword."" After seeming to give up and allowing themselves to be captured, Maj. Smith and Lt. Schaffer, being officers, are separated from the three remaining NCOs—Thomas , Berkeley , and Christiansen . Smith and Schaffer kill their captors and blow up a supply depot before hitching a ride on a cable car—the only approach to the castle. Mary, posing as a maid, had been brought into the castle by Heidi , a deep-cover MI6 agent working as a barmaid in the nearby village; Maj. von Hapen , a Gestapo officer whom Heidi has been cultivating, becomes infatuated with her. Mary helps Schaffer and Smith to climb up a rope and in through a window overlooking the castle's tramway station. Carnaby's interrogation, carried out by Gen. Rosemeyer  and Col. Kramer , is underway when the three NCOs arrive and reveal themselves to be German double agents. Smith and Schaffer intrude, but Smith then forces Schaffer to disarm and establishes himself as Maj. Johann Schmidt of the SD, the military intelligence branch of the SS. He exposes the identity of ""General Carnaby""—that of Cartwright Jones, an American Corporal. He also claims that Thomas, Berkeley and Christiansen are British impostors. To test them, Smith/Schmidt proposes they write the names of their fellow conspirators to be compared to the personal list in his pocket, having discreetly divulged the name of Germany's top agent in Britain to Kramer, who silently affirms it. After the three finish their lists, Smith reveals his list to Kramer, which is in fact blank. With the room now covered by Smith and the re-armed Schaffer, Smith then reveals the rescue operation was a cover for the real mission—to discover the identities of German spies in Britain. Meanwhile, Mary, while preparing the explosives, is visited by von Hapen. He takes her to the castle's cafe and persuades her to recite the tale of her assumed identity. Finding faults in her story, he investigates and happens upon the meeting over Carnaby's interrogation just as Smith finishes his explanation. Von Hapen puts the room under arrest, but is distracted by Mary's entrance, enabling Schaffer to kill him and the other German officers. The group then escapes with Thomas, Berkeley and Christiansen as prisoners. Schaffer sets explosives to create diversions around the compound, while Smith leads the group to the Radio Room, where he informs Rolland of their success. They then battle their way to the cable car station, sacrificing Thomas as a decoy. Berkeley and Christiansen attempt their own escape in a cable car, but Smith, after a roof-top fight with its passengers, destroys the car with an explosive, hurling himself onto a returning cable car and subsequently riding back down with the others. They abandon the car mid-descent to avoid a party of armed Germans and to reunite with Heidi and board a bus as their escape vehicle. With soldiers in hot pursuit, they wreck havoc in an airfield before escaping on a disguised extraction plane, where Col. Turner is waiting for them. Smith briefs Turner on the mission and confirms a suspicion he and Rolland had shared since before the start—that Turner is the top Nazi agent in Britain, whose name the late Kramer had agreed to before. Turner had been lured into participating so MI6 could expose him, with Smith's trusted partner Mary and the American Schaffer, who had no connection to MI6, specially assigned to the team to ensure the mission's success. Smith elaborates further on Rolland's awareness of Turner's duplicity as the exposed spy brings the Sten gun cradled in his lap to bear on Smith, saying the Admiral made sure that he had that particular gun given to him before he boarded the escape plane: Turner attempts to shoot Smith, only to discover the firing pin has been removed. Deciding to save face, Turner commits suicide by jumping out of the plane. The film ends with Schaffer  saying to Smith : ""Do me a favour, will ya? The next time you have one of these things, keep it an all-British operation,"" to which Smith replies, ""I'll try, Lieutenant.""germany mountain world war ii liberation of prisoners bavaria, germany nazi castle parachute two man army infiltration explosion alps mountains commando mission cable car 1940s sidecar fall from height",False,tt0065207,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,21000000,0,0,1.7272727272727273,17.51149136225447,,,,,,,39885000.0,5,71000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,24350000.0,29950000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8119834.0,10149834.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1500000.0,2000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,71000000.0,39885000.0,0.625,1.0,63643507.60930695

Her shy daughter, Ethel , works in a lightbulb factory, and son, Sid , tailors men's suits. Her husband, Stanley ([[Phil Davis , is a car mechanic. Although Vera and her family are poor, their strong family bonds hold them together, and we see Vera's constant small acts of kindness to the many people she encounters throughout her day. Vera works as a house cleaner. However, unbeknownst to her family, she also serves as a backroom abortionist. She receives no money for this, believing her help to be an act of charity. However, Lily , who also carries on a black-market trade in scarce postwar foodstuffs, charges two guineas  for arranging the abortions, without Vera's knowledge. The film also contains a subplot about an upper class young woman, Susan , the daughter of one of Vera's employers. Susan is raped by a suitor, becomes pregnant, and asks a friend to put her in contact with a doctor, through whom she can obtain an abortion. The doctor first refers her to a psychiatrist, who prompts her to answer questions in a certain way, so that he can recommend an abortion on legal grounds: that she has a family history of mental illness and that she may commit suicide if not allowed to terminate the pregnancy. The abortion costs her a hundred guineas. After one of her patients nearly dies, Vera is arrested by the police and taken into custody for questioning. She is held overnight and appears before a magistrate the next morning. Sid is shocked by his mother's secret activities and tells his father that he does not think that he can forgive her. Vera is bailed to appear at the Old Bailey. None of Vera's employers will give her a character reference. Her solicitor thinks she will receive the minimum sentence of 18 months in jail; the judge sentences her to two and a half years imprisonment 'as a deterrent to others'. This affects all the people who previously depended on Vera's kindness.england mother role pregnancy women's prison police neighbor female protagonist miscarriage tailor fingerprint unwanted pregnancy 1950s",False,tt0383694,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,13300000,0,0,0.20909090909090908,1.9257596443831189,-5976470.0,1023530.0,-143702.0,4856298.0,,,264317794.0,6,289317794.0,1.0,-16386538.0,20.0,8613462.0,1.0,-1732765.5,2.0,6017234.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-8815745.0,2.0,184255.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,50773.5,6800773.5,2.0,,,,,,,-9401355.0,598645.0,1.0,,,,50773.5,6800773.5,2.0,-8815745.0,184255.0,1.0,-5997152.333333333,6336181.0,3.0,67954044.0,87754044.0,1.0,-8815745.0,184255.0,1.0,,,,54197534.25,103672534.25,4.0,-6357872.5,1342127.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-2645624.5,9354375.5,2.0,,,,4897257.0,26897257.0,4.0,,,,-1015636.0,4817697.333333333,3.0,,,,-1173477.0,2826523.0,1.0,,,76033186.375,59345686.375,3.75,1.25,84824632.31357588

Jip, the male lead, is suffering from sexual anxiety brought on by a series of unsuccessful liaisons.<ref namehttp://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/03/16/human_traffic_1999_review.shtml|title2010-01-09}}<ref namehttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188674/quotes|title2010-01-11}} Koop, Jip's best friend, is jealous of his girlfriend Nina's easygoing and popular nature. Nina is being sexually harassed in a job she had no choice but to take after having failed a college interview. Lulu, Jip's best female friend and ""dropping partner"", has suffered infidelity in her last 3 relationships. Moff, the newest member of the group having met Jip at a warehouse party after moving from London to Cardiff, is unemployed and scrapes a living as a small time dealer, despite his father being a senior policeman. The five friends become very close, take drugs such as cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine, and ""live for the weekend"". The film follows the exploits of the five friends as well as various characters they meet along the way. They go to pubs and clubs on Friday, taking along Nina's 17-year old brother Lee whose waning enthusiasm for his first drugs experience is played out in a cameo debate between Jip and a doctor. Jip gives up his ticket to Lulu, whom he has talked into coming out and is forced to talk his way into the club as the group are a ticket short. The club scene is then examined through a series of cameos including two attempts by older journalists to understand the club scene. The ensemble then joins a house party, where Lulu and Jip finally kiss and attempt unsuccessfully to make love; whereas the established couple, Koop and Nina, argue over Koop's perceptions about her behaviour. Later, the group finds out ""what goes up must come down"" as the effects of their drug use begin to hit home leaving them coping with feelings of illness and paranoia. They recover Lee from a group of younger partygoers he has spent the night with and make their way home. On returning home, some of the group's issues are resolved whilst some are thrown into sharper relief. Jip makes love to Lulu, overcoming his sexual paranoia. Koop and Nina's issues are set aside. Lee has made it through the weekend without any of his concerns being realised. Moff, however, is still caught up in the paranoia caused by his extensive drug use. He argues with his parents again and is seen walking alone around Cardiff looking dejected. However, Moff joins his friends for an end of the weekend drink and having raged about his difficulties with drugs is soon joking about his excesses with his friends. The film finishes with Jip and Lulu kissing in the street after the manner of classic Hollywood films.sex salesclerk fast food restaurant boredom relationship problems party relationship drugs alcohol abuse fashion cult film group of friends rave culture cardiff",True,tt0188674,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,4000000,0,0,5.666666666666668,15.965307217698705,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,73407251.10798967

At the top of their respective games, Audrey and Daniel are a classic study in opposites. She practices law strictly by the book; he always manages to win by the seat of his pants or by ""cheap theatrics"" as Audrey says in one scene. But soon they are pitted against each other on opposite sides of a nasty public divorce between famous clients, with the case centering upon an Irish castle, named Caisleán Cloiche or rock Castle, that each future divorcee has their sights set on. Audrey and Daniel travel to Ireland to chase down depositions, yet the two lawyers, who have been slowly developing a mutual attraction that neither wants to acknowledge, find themselves thrown together at a romantic Irish festival. After a night of wild celebrating, they wake up the next morning as husband and wife. Audrey is shocked but Daniel seems to be all normal. They return to New York and find their marriage news has been printed in a popular tabloid the next day. This is when Audrey decides that they should stay together to save their careers. But they are fighting the divorce case with the gusto they always had in the courtroom. Meanwhile they both start developing mutual attraction while staying together at Audrey's house. While disposing of garbage one day Daniel discovers some sensitive information about Audrey's client, which he spills accidentally in the next day's court proceedings.

But to everybody's surprise the famous couple is reunited and it turns out that the priest who performed Audrey and Daniel's marriage was just a servant at the castle and not a priest, and the marriages he performed were just a part of the festival's celebration. They were anything but real. Audrey and Daniel are shocked and Daniel returns to New York but Audrey follows him as she realizes that she has fallen in love with him.

She also meets her and later meets Cynthia's brother, Maurice Purley, a photographer, and his wife Monica, and Cynthia's daughter Roxanne, a street cleaner. After being warned by public officials about the troubles Hortense could face by tracking her birthmother down, she continues her investigation and is baffled to learn that her birth mother is white but does not resent her and wants to know more about her own past. At the Purley's it is evident that severe tensions exist between Roxanne and her mother. Both are frustrated with one another and getting on one another's nerves. Maurice and Monica also experience domestic tensions. Monica comes across as abrupt, but later scenes reveal that she suffers from severe menstrual cramps and Monica makes concerted efforts to placate matters and be contrite. Things are also not well between Maurice and his sister, they are a bit awkward with one another but both look forward to celebrating Roxanne’s birthday party. Cynthia refers to Maurice affectionately as her little brother and asks him when he is going to shave as she always does. It is clear that Cynthia somehow can survive by the money she receives from Maurice. Hortense rings Cynthia and asks for a 'Cynthia Rose Purley', and starts talking about a baby ""Elizabeth Purley', born in 1968. Cynthia realises that Hortense is her daughter whom she gave up for adoption and hangs up the phone. Hortense is still determined to find out more about her background. She rings Cynthia again and manages to convince her to meet with her. When they finally do, Cynthia feels that a grave mistake has been made. Hortense convinces Cynthia to have a cup of tea. Hortense asks Cynthia to look at a document; she then begins to cry and then states that she is ashamed. Hortense then wants to know who her father is, to which Cynthia refuses to answer. After a while Hortense and Cynthia have struck up a friendship, which is somewhat noticed by Roxanne after seeing her mother going places but not knowing where, since Cynthia is rather secretive about it. Cynthia mentions the birthday party for Roxanne, she also gives Hortense a gift. Cynthia asks Maurice if she can bring a “mate from work” to Roxanne's party. Cynthia relays this information to Hortense who replies that she would feel a bit awkward. Despite these feelings, she agrees to attend and pose as a colleague from work. The day of the barbecue arrives and Monica makes an effort for everyone to feel welcome. Cynthia makes incisive remarks in passing, but making sure that Monica hears them, about the seemingly high expenses that she makes in her house instead of concentrating of giving Maurice a child. Maurice tells Roxanne that she has a good brain and should be in college. Roxanne does not take this suggestion seriously. Everyone gathers for the barbecue and Maurice prepares the food. During the meal Hortense answers many questions which are naturally put to her by the other guests. Hortense says that she is pursuing medical research and endeavors to be evasive. When Roxanne blows out her birthday candles Cynthia begins to act in an exceptionally nervous manner. She slips that Hortense is her daughter. Everyone dismisses this claim and states that she has had too much to drink. Roxanne is horrified and storms out of the house. Maurice attempts to placate matters by confronting Roxanne at a nearby bus stop. Maurice attempts to convince Roxanne to speak to her mother again and Cynthia apologises to her profusely. Cynthia then explains that she got pregnant at fifteen and her father sent her away and after the adoption she never expected Hortense to come back. Cynthia then accuses Monica of being selfish. Maurice reveals that Monica is physically incapable of having children. Maurice then loses his temper and states that he has spent his whole life trying to make people happy and that he cannot take it anymore because they all hate each other. After witnessing all this Hortense tries to leave but Maurice stops her admiring her courage for trying to find her own past, although he will not reveal who her father was either. Cynthia then explains that Roxanne's father was an American medical student vacationing in Benidorm. One morning in Benidorm, Cynthia awoke, and he was gone. After a while things have calmed down and Hortense is free to visit Cynthia and Roxanne at their home. Hortense reveals that she always wanted a sister. Roxanne reveals that she would be happy to introduce Hortense as her half-sister notwithstanding the long explanations that it would entail.

Words on the screen inform the audience about anti-Semitism in the period, describing the system of the ghetto and Jewish usury. Shylock and Antonio are seen among a crowd watching Jews being thrown from the Rialto Bridge into the canal. Otherwise, the film follows the plot of Shakespeare's play closely. There are some significant emendations: In Act III, scene I, Tubal tells Shylock that in Genoa, a person ""showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey."" Shylock replies ""Thou torturest me, Tubal: It was my turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor; I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys."" Nothing more is said of it. However, in an added scene at the end of the film, there is a close-up shot of the turquoise ring on Jessica's finger, implying that Jessica has somewhat remained loyal to her Jewish heritage. Another significant emendation is that we don't see that Antonio receives the good news that three of his ships were not stranded and have returned safely after all at the end of the film.venice, italy william shakespeare jewish ghetto jew / jewish suitor racism loan merchant money-lender 16th century",True,tt0379889,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,18765585,1,0,-0.5986711845114341,1.9257596443831189,,,-5851171.0,21148829.0,1078149.0,9078149.0,-27641426.0,19,358574.0,1.0,70343462.5,18.0,100093462.5,2.0,146647032.0,6.0,193147032.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-2518438.0,3.0,17731562.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,97091208.0,162091208.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,-143702.0,4856298.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,35127022.0,50527022.0,2.0,,,,,,,-2938254.0,2561746.0,2.0,80989651.0,172989651.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,64765282.5,70015282.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,-3600207.0,399793.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,77832657.625,46707657.625,5.75,1.75,84824632.31357588

Shown from the point-of-view of the camera viewfinder, tension builds as he follows the woman into her house, murders her and later watches the film in his den as the credits roll on the screen. Lewis is a member of a film crew who aspires to become a filmmaker himself. He works part-time photographing soft-porn pin-up pictures of women, sold under the counter. He is a shy, reclusive young man who hardly ever socializes outside of his workplace. He lives in his  father's house, leasing part of it and acting as the landlord, while posing as a tenant himself. Mark is fascinated by the boisterous family living downstairs, and especially by Helen , a sweet-natured young woman who befriends him out of pity. Mark reveals to Helen through home movies taken by his father  that, as a child, he was used as a guinea pig for his father's psychological experiments in fear and the nervous system. Mark's father would study his son's reaction to various stimuli, such as lizards he put on his bed and would film the boy in all sorts of situations, even going as far as recording his son's reactions as he sat with his mother on her deathbed. He kept his son under constant watch and even wired all the rooms so that he could spy on him. The father's studies made his reputation as a psychologist. Mark arranges with Vivian , a stand-in at the studio, to make a film after the set is closed; he then kills her and stuffs her into a prop trunk. The body is discovered later by the horrified film crew. The police link the two murders and notice that each victim died with a look of utter terror on her face. They interview everyone on the set and become suspicious of Mark, who has his camera always running, always recording and who claims that he is making a documentary. A psychiatrist, called to the set to console the upset star of the movie, chats with Mark and tells him that he is familiar with his father's work. The psychiatrist relates the details of the conversation to the police, noting that Mark has ""his father's eyes"". Mark is tailed by the police who follow him to the building where he takes photographs of the pin-up model Milly . Two versions of this scene were shot. The more risqué version is credited as being the first female nude scene in a major British feature Nudist Paradise  was released before Peeping Tom  and that had fully naked women in it . Mark kills Milly and then returns home. Helen, who is curious about Mark's films, finally runs one of them. She becomes visibly upset and frightened when he catches her. Mark reveals that he makes the movies so that he can capture the fear of his victims. He has mounted a round mirror atop his camera, so that he can capture the reactions of his victims as they see their impending deaths. The police arrive and Mark realizes he is cornered. As he had planned from the very beginning, he impales himself with a knife attached to one of the camera's tripod legs, killing himself the same way he dispatched his victims, and with the camera running, providing the finale for his documentary.cinematographer photography illegal prostitution cult film movie projector proto-slasher",False,tt0054167,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,83957,0,0,-0.7866288695403599,6.959566623388993,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,73858774.74729376

The company releases a new line of Good Guy dolls and recycles Chucky's remains. However, the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray still inhabited the remains, and Chucky is soon revived in a new doll body. Chucky is unwittingly given to Play Pals' CEO Mr. Sullivan, whom Chucky tortures and kills using various instruments. He then uses computer records to relocate Andy Barclay . Still troubled by his past encounters with Chucky, sixteen year old Andy has been sent to Kent Military School. Colonel Cochran , the school's commandant, begrudgingly enrolls Andy, but advises him to forget his ""fantasies"" about the doll. Inside the school, Andy befriends cadets Harold Aubrey Whitehurst , Ronald Tyler , and Kristin DeSilva , for whom he develops romantic feelings. He also meets Brett C. Shelton , a lieutenant colonel who routinely bullies the cadets. Not long after Andy arrives, Tyler is asked to deliver a package to his room. Tyler is fascinated with Good Guy dolls after seeing an ad on the TV upon their comeback. After accidentally dropping and ripping Andy's package, he realizes that the package contains a Good Guy doll. Excited, he takes the new toy to the cellar and unwraps it. Once freed, Chucky scolds Tyler for opening the package he was suppose to give to Andy. But realizing he has a new body, he decides to tells Tyler his true identity to take over his body instead. But just as Chucky is about to possess him, they are interrupted by Cochran, who takes the doll away. Cochran throws Chucky into a garbage truck, but Chucky escapes by luring the driver into the truck's compactor and crushing him. That night, Chucky attacks Andy and tells him his plans for taking over Tyler's soul. But before Andy can attack Chucky, Shelton comes in and takes the doll from him. Andy tries to get the doll back by sneaking into Shelton's room, but Shelton catches him in the act. Upon realizing the doll has vanished, Shelton suspects it stolen and forces all the cadets to do exercises in the courtyard as punishment. Andy tries to warn Tyler about Chucky, but is initially unheeded. At one point, Chucky lures Tyler into playing hide-and-seek in Cochran's office, where he attempts to possess the boy again. However, they are interrupted by DeSilva and, moments later, Cochran himself. When the cadets leave, Cochran is confronted by a knife-wielding Chucky. The resulting shock causes Cochran to suffer a fatal heart attack. Despite Cochran's death, Shelton declares that the school's annual war games will proceed as planned, with Andy and Shelton on opposing teams. However, Chucky secretly replaces the paint bullets of one team with live ammunition. When the simulation begins, Chucky accosts Tyler, then threatens the boy when he refuses to take part. Tyler stabs Chucky with a pocket knife and flees, trying to find Andy. Chucky then attacks DeSilva and holds her hostage, attempting to lure the teams into fighting each other to save her. Chucky forces Andy to exchange DeSilva for Tyler. Suddenly, the red team descends upon the area and obliviously opens fire with their live rounds. Shelton is killed in the crossfire. Amidst the chaos, Tyler makes a quick getaway, but before giving chase, Chucky tosses a live grenade at the quarreling cadets. Recognizing the danger, Whitehurst bravely leaps on top of the grenade and sacrifices himself to save the others. With no time to mourn his friend, Andy heads off in pursuit of Chucky, with DeSilva close behind. Eventually the chase leads the group into a haunted house at a nearby carnival. Ronald tries to get a security guard to help him, but Chucky kills the guard off screen and kidnaps Tyler. In the ensuing melee, Chucky shoots DeSilva in the leg, leaving Andy to fight Chucky alone, once again. When Tyler is inadvertently knocked out, Chucky seizes the opportunity to possess him, but Andy intervenes, shooting him several times. Enraged, Chucky attempts to strangle Andy, but Andy uses Tyler's knife to cut off Chucky's hand, dropping him into a giant fan which slices him to pieces. Afterwards, Andy is taken away by the police for questioning, but ensures DeSilva that he will be okay, as he's ""dealt with them before"". As the police car drives away, DeSilva is taken to the nearby hospital. Tyler's fate is never revealed. At the end of the movie, a janitor walks around the park cleaning up the place while all the rides are shutting down. He then walks towards the haunted house, where Chucky was killed.recruit puppet killer doll serial killer military academy killer toys toy comes to life war game",False,tt0103956,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,20560255,0,0,0.5815580769230769,-4.754674342337864,13702147.42857143,24916433.14285714,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,13564027.0,4.0,14564027.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14564027.0,13564027.0,0.5,1.0,43607562.87364688

His father, Hussein, is a Pakistani journalist who lives in London but hates Britain and its international politics. His dissatisfaction with the world and a family tragedy has caused his alcoholism to take over, so that Omar has to take care of him. By contrast, Omar's paternal uncle Nasser is a successful entrepreneur and an active member of the London Pakistani community. Omar's father asks his uncle to give him a job and, after working for a brief time as a car washer in one of his uncle's garages, he is assigned the task of running a run-down laundrette and turning it into a profitable business. At Nasser's, Omar meets a few other members of the Pakistani community: Tania, Nasser's daughter and possibly a future bride; and Salim, who traffics drugs and hires him to deliver them from the airport. While driving Salim and his wife home that night, the three of them get attacked by a group of right-wing extremists shouting racist slogans. Among them, Omar recognizes an old friend of his, Johnny. Omar asks Johnny to resume their friendship. Johnny decides to help with the laundrette and they resume a romantic relationship which  had been interrupted after school. Running out of money, Omar and Johnny sell one of Salim's drug deliveries to make cash for the laundrette redecoration. The laundrette becomes a success. At the opening day, Nasser visits the store with his mistress, Rachel. They dance together in the laundrette while Omar and Johnny are having sex in the back room. Omar and Johnny are almost caught by Nasser, but Omar claims they were sleeping. Tania confronts Rachel about having an affair with her father, Nasser. Nasser and Rachel leave the laundrette and fight in the road; Rachel storms off because she feels humiliated by Tania and her presence. Later in the film, she falls ill with a skin rash apparently caused by a ritual curse from Nasser's wife, and Rachel decides to leave him. Omar, while drunk, proposes to Tania. She agrees on the condition that Omar gathers money. Omar's father also stops by, late in the night, and appeals to Johnny to persuade Omar to go to college because he is unhappy with his son running a laundrette. Omar decides to take over two laundrettes owned by a friend of Nasser, with the help of Salim. Salim drives Johnny and Omar to view one of the properties, and he expresses his dislike of the British non-working punks . Salim attempts to run over the group of punks who had previously attacked Omar's car and injures one of them. The group of working class punks decides to wait for Salim around the laundrette. While the punks circle the laundrette, Tania drops by and tells Johnny she is leaving and asks if he will come with her. He refuses Tania by revealing his relationship with Omar, and she departs. When Salim enters the laundrette, the punks trash his car. Upon noticing their destruction, he runs out of the laundrette and is then ambushed and attacked. He is beaten and bloodied until Johnny decides to save him, despite their mutual dislike. The punks turn their attention to attacking Johnny instead for supporting the Pakistani community, and beat him savagely until he is saved by Omar. The film cuts to Nasser visiting Omar's father, and their discussion about Omar's future. Nasser sees Tania at a train platform while she is running away, and he shouts to her but she disappears. Omar proceeds to clean up Johnny's wounds, and the two bond. The film ends with them playfully splashing each other with water from a sink while topless, implying they are continuing their relationship.london, england gay immigration society british independent film racism cult film laundry pakistani culture",False,tt0091578,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,2451545,0,0,1.8506337209302328,0.8905496399261349,435023.0,2181987.0,,,,,,0,,,-16386538.0,1.0,8613462.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,56824936.8,78924936.8,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8613462.0,-16386538.0,0.125,1.0,51342232.19105865

Charlotte is conventionally English, with an extremely restrictive personality and tends to get her way by expressing her emotions to manipulate others. Lucy has been brought up in an upper class but loving and easygoing household, and had fewer inhibitions, which creates a strong tension between Charlotte and herself. They are in contrast with the more free-thinking and free-spirited backdrop of Italy. At a small pensione Lucy meets such people as Reverend Beebe, the two Miss Alans, and the author Miss Eleanor Lavish, as well as the aging Mr. Emerson and his handsome, philosophical son, George, who becomes friends with Charlotte. These men, although also English, represent the forward-thinking ideals of the turn-of-the-century, seeking to leave behind the repression and caution that was the norm in Victorian times. At first, the two Emerson men seem strange and unfamiliar to Lucy and Charlotte. The men seem unaware of finer upper class Victorian manners, and offer Lucy and Charlotte a room with a view where the gentlemen have already slept, and Charlotte fusses until she must give in or appear overbearingly rude. As Lucy begins her journey to maturity, she finds herself drawn to George due to his mysterious thinking and readily expressed emotions. A number of people residing at the pensione take a carriage ride in the country. A mischievous Italian driver gets back at Charlotte by misdirecting an unchaperoned Lucy to George in a barley field as he admires the view. George suddenly embraces and passionately kisses Lucy as she approaches him. Charlotte has followed Lucy, witnesses the act, and quickly stops the intimacy. George's unreserved passion shocks Lucy, but also lights a secret desire and romance in her heart. Charlotte suggests George kissing her was the act of a rake. Charlotte makes reference to a heartbreak from her youth that occurred the same way and has behaved accordingly with disgust and anger toward George. Charlotte uses guilt to coerce Lucy to secrecy to save both their reputations as a young lady and a chaperone, but it is mostly for her own benefit. Normally, if a young man kissed a young lady, an engagement should be announced to preserve her reputation, but Charlotte considers George to be an undesirable influence. Upon returning to England, Lucy tells her mother nothing due to Charlotte's influence, and pretends to forget the incident. She accepts a marriage proposal from an uptight, but respectable and wealthy man named Cecil Vyse . However, she soon learns that both George and his father have moved to her small village and will be her neighbors due to a letter from Cecil Vyse inviting them to reside in an empty cottage. The appearance of George soon disrupts Lucy's plans and causes her suppressed feelings to resurface, complicated by the supposed need for secrecy. Lucy consistently refuses George's attempts to woo her because of Charlotte's admonitions. A confused Lucy breaks her engagement to Cecil due to George's influence, and plans to travel with the two Miss Alans, this time to escape the nearness of George. George has also decided that he must move for peace of mind and makes arrangements. Lucy stops by Reverend Beebe's and is confronted by George's father before they are to leave town. Lucy runs down the road and catches up with her mother's carriage and reveals the truth about her feelings. At the end, we see George and Lucy honeymooning in the Italian pensione where they met, in the room with the view.based on novel or book tennis kiss bed and breakfast place surrey florence skinny dipping spinster edwardian england early 1900s",False,tt0091867,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,20966644,0,0,5.9888813333333335,0.8905496399261349,,,32631771.75,46231771.75,-66043.0,83957.0,,0,,,20300291.0,1.0,34700291.0,1.0,,0.0,,,863102.6666666666,9.0,9196436.0,3.0,-7397496.5,1.0,5532503.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16476410.166666666,4588632.388888889,1.375,2.0,51342232.19105865

In the small town of Huntingburg, Indiana, which has been evacuated, Tom and Charlie drive into a ditch and become stuck, and Charlie calls dispatch to alert the National Guard. They are then ambushed by Jim  and his gang of armed robbers, Kenny , Mr Mehlor  and Ray ([[Ricky Harris . Kenny accidentally shoots Charlie dead, as Tom gets away with the 3 million in cash and hides it in a cemetery. After being chased through the local Middle School by the gang now travelling with a boat and jet skis, Tom takes refuge in a nearby church. He is knocked out and wakes up in a cell at the local Sheriff's office. Tom tells the local sheriff Mike Collig  about the gang and the area he hid the money, although he keeps him locked up. He and his Deputy Wayne  then leave to investigate, whilst another officer Phil  is ordered to take Karen , the woman who knocked Tom out and is currently restoring the church, out of town. In protest, she pushes Phil out of the boat so she will be able to fill the water pumps at her church. The town's dam continues to experience huge pressure from the rain and the operator Hank  is forced to open another levee. This causes another huge burst of water to stream through the town, resulting in even worse flooding, especially at the church. Tom wakes in his cell, trapped as the Sheriff's building slowly fills up with water. After filling the pumps at the church, Karen returns and saves him by opening the light fitting on the roof for him to escape. They are then spotted by the gang, and hide before having to get out of the water because a nearby transformer is going to blow. Kenny grabs Tom and they both fall in the water, but Tom fights him off before Kenny is electrocuted and later dies. Tom and Karen enter a nearby house, only to discover locals Doreen  and Henry Sears  who believe they are looters. After explaining their story, Henry decides to give Tom their boat so he can return to the armored truck. When he resurfaces from the now submerged truck, he finds Jim and the gang holding the elderly couple hostage. Tom forces Jim to let them go so he'll show them where the money is. On the way to the cemetery, Jim reveals to Tom that the National Guard were never coming because Charlie was actually calling the gang, and was in an alliance with them. He was only killed because Kenny was never told Charlie was on their side. Jim then sends Tom to retrieve the money but finds it has gone. When the gang are about to shoot him in anger, they are all ambushed by Sheriff Collig and his deputies, who have found Karen, and the money. The Sheriff now doesn't care any more about justice and intends to keep the money, splitting it between himself, Wayne, Phil and Hank, who has now joined them from the dam. Mr. Mehlor and Ray are killed in the shoot out, and Jim and Tom escape in a boat, finding sanctuary in the church. Wayne, not wanting any witnesses left, takes Karen back to her house, and handcuffs her to the banister, with an intention of raping her and leaving her to drown. The others try to force Tom and Jim out by throwing molotov cocktails on the roof, but they fail, and instead drive into the church through the stained glass windows. At Karen's house, Karen manages to stab Wayne with her pocketknife, killing him. In the church, a shoot out occurs where at one point Tom and Phil come face to face, but Phil cannot bring himself to shoot him. Hank then shoots Phil, thinking he's a coward. The alarm from the dam saying it is overflowed suddenly sounds. Offering a deal, the sheriff says he'll tell Tom and Jim where Karen is, if they let Hank and himself go with a couple of the moneybags. Tom agrees, yet Jim does not. A dying Phil then tells Tom where Karen is, and Tom then leaves to try to save her. Jim goes to leave with the money in the sheriff's boat, but the sheriff shoots Jim with a revolver he was hiding, wounding his shoulder. Sheriff Collig and Hank escape in a boat and, when they are forced to go faster to avoid the wave engulfing the town, the Sheriff pushes Hank out of the boat, who tries to swim to safety, but is caught in a gas explosion and dies. Tom arrives at Karen's house, to find her handcuffed to the banister. He first tries to free her with a saw, but it breaks, and he instead uses Wayne's gun. The water is so high now they have to get onto the roof and are then caught by Sheriff Collig. Jim, who managed to escape from the church, comes from behind them in a boat. The Sheriff shoots at him, disabling the steering, forcing him to go over the roof. As he does so, the outboard breaks off and collides with the sheriff, knocking him into the water. However, he is not dead, and tries to shoot Karen and grab a moneybag, but Tom and Jim manage to shoot him dead. Tom tells Jim he should leave, just as the State Police arrive. Jim picks up the Sheriff's moneybag and rows away, as Tom tells Karen the fire damage to her church wasn't too bad, and ""was probably why they felt safe enough to drive their boats through the stained glass windows"".sheriff small town rain evacuation armored car crook thief money gunfight church security guard hoodlum flood",True,tt0120696,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,19870567,0,0,-2.5227983177329567,-2.5293608277783246,,,,,-26043392.0,33956608.0,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,11327381.0,13327381.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-26043392.0,33956608.0,1.0,,,,,0.0,,60772021.118274406

He loves his children very much, but spends little time with them, unable to handle raising them all on his own, after their mother died. The children have had a series of seventeen nannies, whom they systematically drive out; it is a point of pride for them to get rid of each nanny as fast as possible. They also terrorize the cook, Mrs. Blatherwick  but are cared for and loved by Evangeline  the young scullery maid. Cedric attempts to hire another nanny from the agency that sent the past seventeen nannies, but the agency refuses him, as the children have sent the past nannies away, terrorized. Desperate to find another nanny, Cedric heeds the advice of a mysterious voice from the house, which says, ""the person you need is Nanny McPhee."" After a series of mysterious events, an unusual and hideous woman named Nanny McPhee  arrives at Brown home, introducing herself as a ""government nanny."" She finds the children destroying the kitchen, and when they refuse to go to bed, she taps her magic staff, causing the children to uncontrollably demolish the kitchen . When Simon finally says ""please"", she magically clears up the mess and sends them up to bed. In similar fashions, with discipline and magic, she transforms the family's lives. In the process, she gradually becomes less hideous. The children, led by Simon, attempt to play their tricks on her, but gradually start to respect her and ask her for advice. Unbeknownst to the children, the family is financially supported by the late Mrs. Brown's Aunt, the fearsome Lady Adelaide Stitch . Though she believes that she is acting in concern for the well-being of her family, Adelaide is the source of major conflicts in the Browns' lives. In conjunction with her support for the family, Adelaide demands custody over one of the children in order to ensure their continued education and proper upbringing. She initially chooses Chrissy to go with her, but as the children - and Cedric himself - loathe the idea of parting with one of the siblings, Simon offers up Evangeline in Chrissy's place. Adelaide agrees, assuming that she is one of the daughters, and adopts Evangeline as her own. Both Evangeline's desire to be properly educated, as well as Adelaide's latest contractual stipulation, are satisfied by the act of trickery. Lady Adelaide also demands that Cedric remarry within the month, threatening to cut off the family's allowance if he fails to do so. Desperate to keep his family together and prevent losing his house, Cedric turns to the ghastly and thrice-widowed Selma Quickly . Based on the image of stepmothers in fairy tales, the children assume that stepmothers are all cruel, and attempt to sabotage a visit from Mrs. Quickly. Mr. Brown's endeavors to protect Mrs. Quickly from his children result in him throwing himself on top of her, pulling her to the floor and burying his face in her cleavage. Nevertheless, Mrs. Quickly - ignorant of the children's pranks - is happy with all this provided that she gets a proposal. However, when his proposal is ruined by more pranks, she leaves angrily and refuses to see him again. The children are thrilled that Mrs. Quickly is gone, but are horrified when Cedric explains the situation. They beg Nanny McPhee to reverse what happened, but she reminds them that she cannot as it was caused by their own actions and they had promised to face the consequences. Realising the only option, they confess to Mrs. Quickly that they were to blame for the disturbance of her visit, and lure her with promises of Aunt Adelaide's wealth. On the day of the wedding, the children discover that Mrs. Quickly is as conniving and cruel as they had feared when she breaks Aggie's rattle - a memento of their late mother. When everyone is gathered for the wedding, Simon despairs that there is nothing more they can do to stop this marriage. Nanny McPhee advises Simon the best thing is to do ""exactly as you are told."" Aggie begins repeating the word ""beehive""  to Simon, who realizes the baby is telling him what to do. He and the other children disrupt the ceremony by pretending a swarm of bees has been attracted to Quickly's flowered hat. Things rapidly descend into chaos; the priest is deathly allergic to bees and panics, and this soon leads to a riotous food fight. Cedric realizes that both he and his children truly dislike his wife-to-be, and joins in the disruption of the ceremony. Mrs. Quickly asks Cedric point blank if he can actually see any bees, and he says that yes, he can, then swats an imaginary bee from her hat so forcefully that she falls to the ground. Angered, Mrs. Quickly puts an end to the wedding and storms off. Just as it seems that Adelaide's marriage deadline has passed without result, Simon realizes that his father could still marry Evangeline, to whom he has demonstrated something of an attraction, and vice versa. Although both Cedric and Evangeline attempt to deny it, due to the inevitable breaking of class boundaries such a marriage would cause, they finally admit their love for each other. Nanny McPhee taps her magic staff one last time, and provides a perfect backdrop for Cedric's marriage to Evangeline by creating a beautiful snowstorm, covering over the ruined mess of the ceremony site, and fulfilling Mrs. Blatherwick's earlier declarations that ""it'll be snowing in August before this family is straightened out!"" She also magically transforms Evangeline's dress into a glorious, white wedding gown, seemingly woven from the falling snowflakes, and Aggie's rattle is magically restored. Aunt Adelaide's demand is satisfied, and all of the family's problems are solved. Now that the children have learned all of Nanny McPhee's lessons, she has been transformed from the heavyset hag they first met into a beautiful young woman. As the wedding ceremony commences, Nanny McPhee is seen in the final frames, her silhouette walking into the horizon, with her voiceover reiterating her earlier declaration that ""When you need me, but do not want me, then I must stay. When you want me, but no longer need me, then I have to go.""loss of loved one nanny education children single father wizard based on young adult novel",False,tt0396752,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,122489822,0,0,3.89959288,-2.6760407675788414,,,73715019.875,110324394.875,102313290.94117647,126204349.76470588,49115229.625,16,70802729.625,8.0,146872436.5,16.0,170372436.5,8.0,2915723.6666666665,9.0,7249057.0,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,76439301.2,99799301.2,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,40515982.0,43515982.0,1.0,,,,,,,68098548.0,110765214.66666667,3.0,94062083.21428572,127694940.35714285,14.0,,,,220792891.5,248917891.5,4.0,,,,,,,,,,-6439124.0,7060876.0,1.0,118582776.0,134582776.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18909093.0,21909093.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,82808074.375,66301129.93055555,5.125,6.333333333333333,109858494.28372188

They are brought together by Freud , a European refugee who travels with a performing bear. In the 1950s, Win Berry  and his wife  have five children, John , Franny , Frank , Lilly , and Egg . The Berrys decide to open a hotel near the prep school that John, Franny, and Frank attend; they call it the Hotel New Hampshire. John loses his virginity to the hotel waitress. Frank comes out to Franny and John; Franny is raped by big man on campus Chip Dove  and his buddies, and is rescued by Junior Jones  and other black members of the school football team; John confesses that he's in love with Franny; the family dog, Sorrow, dies and Frank has him stuffed. Sorrow's reappearance at Christmas causes Berry grandfather Iowa Bob  to suffer a fatal heart attack. A letter arrives from Austria. It's Freud, inviting the Berrys to move to Vienna and run Freud's gasthaus. The family flies to Europe; tragically, the plane carrying Mrs. Berry and Egg explodes, killing them. In Vienna, the family moves into the gasthaus and renames it Hotel New Hampshire. An upper floor houses prostitutes and the basement is occupied by radicals of various political stripes. Assisting Freud, who has gone blind, is Susie the Bear , a young lesbian who lives her life almost completely in a bear costume. One of the radicals, Ernst, resembles Chipper Dove  and Franny becomes infatuated with him. Susie and John, who are both in love with Franny, try to keep her away from him. Susie is initially successful in seducing Franny but soon she ends up with Ernst. Lilly, who is a dwarf, begins writing a novel called Trying to Grow. One of the radicals, Miss Miscarriage , grows very fond of the family, and especially of Lilly. She invites John to her flat and sleeps with him, then warns him to get the family out of Vienna. For her trouble, another of the radicals murders her. Back at the hotel, John and the rest of the family are caught up in the radicals' plan to blow up the Vienna State Opera with a car bomb. The blind Freud, to spare the family, volunteers to drive with one of the radicals. As he leaves, the Berrys attack the remaining radicals and Freud detonates the bomb right outside the hotel. Ernst is killed and Win is blinded in the explosion. Hailed as heroes by the Austrians, the Berry family decides to return home. Lilly's novel is published and the interest in the Berry's story leads to a biopic, written by Lilly and starring Franny as herself. The Berrys are in New York City when John and Susie run into Chipper Dove on the streets. They lure him to their hotel suite and take their revenge upon him, including apparently having Susie sodomize him while she's in her bear costume, until Franny calls it off. Meanwhile, John's love for Franny has not abated. She finally calls him over to her room and, in hopes of getting him over it once and for all, has sex with him for almost a day. Franny's Hollywood career is beginning to take off, with Frank acting as her agent and with Junior Jones back in the picture, but Lilly's writing career has stalled. Her second novel is not well received and, depressed and suffering from writer's block, she takes her own life. As the film draws to a close, John is staying with his father at the latest Hotel New Hampshire, which stands empty. Susie comes to stay with them and she and John become involved. Win heartily approves because, as he puts it, every hotel needs a bear.bomb prostitute rape sex hotel based on novel or book terrorist fight satire stuffed animal vienna, austria",False,tt0087428,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,5142858,0,0,-0.4583330902778183,3.9275459302257203,23967437.0,34967437.0,36600000.0,37600000.0,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-23060577.0,3.0,939423.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36600000.0,37600000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24957634.666666668,32457634.666666668,3.0,,,,,,,,,939423.0,-23060577.0,0.375,1.0,48770840.0372125

People exist in industrialized slums kept running on outdated and decaying computer technology. A nomad zone tripper,  comes across the remains of a robot buried in the sand. He collects the pieces and takes them to junk dealer Alvy , who is talking with 'Hard Mo' Baxter , a soldier in the corps returning home from duty on December 24th during the Christmas cease-fire, and his friend, Shades . Seeing the robot parts, Moses asks the nomad where he found them, to which he repiles, ""...Glass Flats, Dune Sea—I go all over."" Mo strikes a deal with the nomad to buy them, hoping that they could be a Christmas present for his blow-torch metal sculptor and painter artist girlfriend, Jill Berkowski , a recluse who never leaves her apartment. Moses and Shades head back to the apartment building amidst news of a new government initiative to enforce sterilizations to reduce overpopulation; Moses and Jill had intended to start a family but are reluctant to do so due to post-atomic genetic mutation. After Moses falls asleep in Jill's apartment, Jill awakes and takes the skull and other parts of the robot while using a cardboard box full of plastic baby-dolls that Shades found on the steets, and begins blow torch welding them into a scultpture under the dim light of an LED decibel display of a sound stereo's graphic equalizer. Later that night, Moses is vid-phoned by Alvy, who researched the robot parts that Moses purchased. They turn out to be components of a new government project called the M.A.R.K.-13, labeled as a CLASS/TYPE A-DELIVERER—capable of independent intelligence, self repair, and the ability to recharge itself using any available electric source, the type was halted because of a defect in its moisture insulation system. Alvy tells Moses, excited by their find. Before leaving, Moses, struck by the familiarity of the phrase ""Mark 13,"" consults his Bible, and discovers that the passage contains the phrase, ""no flesh shall be spared"" . He becomes suspicious that the acronym is an inspiration to the android's name in a government plot of human genocide. Before Moses can make it to Alvy's, a piece of the robot at Alvy's shop reactivates and kills him by injecting him with a cytotoxin that causes hallucinations and brief euphoria before death. Moses finds the body and after consulting Alvy's notes on the robot, calls Shades to help him rescue Jill. Meanwhile, Shades, whose apartment is covered in Eastern objects, has fallen into a drug-induced Kundalini syndrome and is unable to answer his vid-phone. Back at the apartment, the robot has reassembled itself using pieces of Jill's metal sculptures, recharging off of the apartment's computer network. It tries to kill Jill, but she manages to trap it in a room. Lincoln Wineberg , a peeping tom who has been spying on Jill, sees the device close the blinds in her apartment, stopping him from spying. He goes over to check on her, insisting she reopen the blinds, but she denies doing it and realizes someone or something is in the apartment. When Wineberg re-opens the blinds, he is killed by the M.A.R.K.-13 which closed them to keep its actions covert, knowing he was spying. Jill manages to damage the robot before Moses and Shades arrive with the apartment's security team. The men open fire on the machine, apparently destroying it. Jill is suddenly thrown out of the high-rise's window by the still-mobile M.A.R.K.-13, and falls into an apartment on a lower story. While everyone else goes to Jill's rescue, Moses struggles with the robot. He manages to cripple it, but is injected with the cytotoxin. As he dies, Moses recounts the machine's manufacturing defect. Jill wakes up and heads back upstairs to rescue Moses. The robot uses a hacked automatic door to cut a security guard in half, and the dying man kills his partner with friendly fire. As the robot recharges itself on the building's mainframe, Jill hacks into its CPU, accessing its memory bank, and hearing a recording of Moses' dying words. Realizing the machine's weakness, Jill lures the robot to the bathroom, where she is thrown through the shower door. Shades arrives and shoots the machine in the head, giving Jill the opportunity to turn on the shower with the water short-circuiting the M.A.R.K.-13. The next morning, a radio broadcast informs listeners that 800 new jobs are available due to the government's having approved mass-manufacture of the M.A.R.K.-13.{{cite web}}disc jockey cyborg killer robot artist nuclear radiation post-apocalyptic dystopia sculpture based on comic murder robot as menace independent film blood cyberpunk violence desert surveillance apartment cult film security system voyeur drought polluted air population control home security junk art synthetic drug computer technology overpopulated world scavengers industrial pollution",False,tt0099740,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,5728953,0,0,2.819302,16.025788582653266,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,97515116.94264027

While attempting to board a plane back to the US with his girlfriend, Billy is arrested by Turkish police on high alert due to fear of terrorist attacks. He is strip-searched, photographed and questioned. After a while, a shadowy American  arrives, takes Billy to a police station and translates for Billy for one of the detectives. On questioning Billy tells them that he bought the hash from a taxicab driver, and offers to help the police track him down in exchange for his release. Billy goes with the police to a nearby market and points out the cab driver, but when the police go to arrest the cabbie Billy sees an opportunity and makes a run for it. He gets cornered in a building and is recaptured by the mysterious American. During his first night in holding, Billy, freezing cold, sneaks out of his cell and steals a blanket. Later that night he is rousted from his cell and brutally beaten by the chief of guards, Hamidou. He wakes a few days later in Sağmalcılar prison, surrounded by fellow western prisoners Jimmy , Max  and Erich  who help him to his feet. Jimmy tells Billy that the prison is a dangerous place for foreigners like themselves and that no-one can be trusted, not even the young children. In the ensuing weeks following his arrest, Billy attempts to gain his release through the Turkish justice system. On the advice of Max, he hires a Turkish attorney, Yesil, who has a reputation for having successfully defended another prisoner also arrested with a large quantity of hashish. Billy’s father arrives from the US and the two share an emotional reunion. The courtroom scene at Billy’s trial is disorienting to both father and son as the prosecutor rapidly hurls accusations at Billy in Turkish. As the two ask their lawyer for an explanation, Yesil reassures them the remarks were just technical and not to worry, that the judge likes him. The judge returns a verdict of 4 years in prison angering the prosecutor and devastating Billy and his father. Yesil assures them it is an excellent outcome and that Billy could have received a lifetime sentence for smuggling, a sentence the prosecutor was vehemently arguing for. Father and son retreat to a small holding area where they tearfully share their devastation. Billy is hauled off to begin his sentence. In the next several years, Billy settles into life as a prisoner in this strange and horrible place. He begins a close relationship with Erich. Erich is gay and wishes to consummate the relationship but Billy refuses. Shortly after, Erich is released. Billy actually settles into some sense of normalcy engaging in long conversations with Max, smoking the cheap and awful drugs sold in the prison by chief snitch and prison trustee Rifki and counting the days until his release. Rifki is despised by all and routinely taunts the English speaking prisoners. Eighteen months before his release, Jimmy tries to get Max and Billy to go along with an escape plan. Billy refuses essentially putting his faith in the justice system due to release him in a year and a half. Jimmy tries on his own, is caught, and is severely beaten, nearly to death. In 1974, 53 days before his original term in prison is to expire, Billy's sentence is overturned by the Turkish High Court in Ankara after a prosecution appeal , and he is ordered to serve at least a 30-year life term for his crime. His stay becomes a living hell: terrifying scenes of physical and mental torture follow one another culminating in Billy having a breakdown and beating to near death his fellow prisoner Rifki, biting out Rifki's tongue in the process. Following this breakdown he is sent to the prison's ward for the insane where he wanders in a daze among the other disturbed and catatonic prisoners. He meets fellow prisoner Ahmet whilst participating in the regular inmate activity of walking in a circle around a pillar. Ahmet claims to be a philosopher from Oxford University and engages him in conversation to which Billy is unresponsive. In 1975, Billy's girlfriend, Susan, comes to see him and is devastated at what has happened to him. She tells him that he has to escape or else he will die in there and leaves him a scrapbook with money hidden inside as ""a picture of your good friend Mr. Franklin from the bank,"" hoping Billy can use it to help him escape. Her visit moves Billy strongly, and he begins to regain some of his senses. He says goodbye to Max, telling him not to die and to wait for Billy to come back for him. He attempts to bribe the head guard to take him to the sanitarium where there are no guards. Instead the guard takes Billy past the sanitarium to another room and attempts to rape him. With a freak stroke of luck, Billy kills the brutish and sadistic guard by pushing him on to a coat hook. He seizes the opportunity to escape by putting on a guard's uniform and managing to walk out of the front door. In the epilogue it is explained that on the night of October 4, 1975 he successfully crossed the border to Greece, and arrived home three weeks later.prison drug smuggle attempt to escape escape lawyer torture brutality masturbation",False,tt0077928,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,35000000,1,0,14.217391304347824,15.1328345263288,19870439.2,24900439.2,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16694500.0,23294500.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,68011965.11413558

The IRA demands the release of other jailed IRA members, threatening to execute Jody in three days if their demands are not met. While the amiable Fergus guards Jody, they develop a bond – much to the chagrin of the other IRA men. During this time, Jody tells Fergus the story about the Scorpion and the Frog. Jody persuades Fergus to make sure his girlfriend, Dil , will be all right after Jody has been killed. The deadline set by Jody's captors passes and Jody is to be executed. Fergus takes Jody into the woods to carry out the sentence. However, Jody knows that Fergus is no murderer at heart, and makes a break for it. Sure enough, Fergus cannot bring himself to shoot the fleeing Jody in the back, but Jody is instead accidentally run over and killed by British armoured personnel carriers as they suddenly move in to assault the IRA safehouse. With his IRA companions seemingly dead after the attack, Fergus hides from the main body of the IRA in London, where he takes a job as a day labourer, using the alias ""Jimmy"". While in London, Fergus meets Jody's attractive girlfriend Dil at a hair salon. Later they talk in a bar, where the next evening he sees her singing ""The Crying Game"". Fergus still suffers from guilt about Jody's death and sees him in his dreams bowling a cricket ball to him. He continues to pursue Dil, protecting her from an obsessive suitor and gradually falling in love with her. Later, when he is about to make love to her in her apartment, he discovers that she is in fact a pre-op transwoman. His initial reaction is of revulsion. Rushing to the bathroom to throw up, he accidentally hits Dil in the face, leaving her with a nosebleed. He then leaves the apartment. A few days later, Fergus leaves Dil a note, and the two make up. Despite everything, Dil is still attracted to him. Around the same time, Jude unexpectedly reappears in Fergus' apartment. She tells him that the IRA has tried and convicted him in absentia. She forces him to agree to help with a new mission to aid in assassinating a well-known official. She also off-handedly mentions that she knows about Fergus and Dil, warning him that the IRA will kill him if Fergus does not co-operate. Fergus, however, cannot overcome his feelings for Dil, and continues wooing her. Fergus shields her from possible retribution by giving her a haircut and male clothes, as a disguise. The night before the IRA mission is to be carried out, Dil gets heavily drunk and Fergus has to escort her to her apartment, where Dil asks for Fergus to stay with her. Fergus complies, then admits to Dil that he had an indirect hand in her former boyfriend's death. Dil, drunk, appears not to have understood, but in the morning, before Fergus wakes up, Dil ties him to the bed. Dil unwittingly prevents Fergus from joining the other IRA members and completing the planned assassination. Holding Fergus at gunpoint, Dil forces him to tell Dil that he loves her and will never leave her. Dil unties him, saying that, even if he is lying, it is still nice to hear his words. Dil then breaks down in tears. A vengeful Jude then enters their room with a gun, seeking to kill Fergus for missing the assassination. Dil takes several shots at Jude, hitting her, whilst stating that she is aware that Jude was complicit in Jody's death and that Jude used her sexuality to trick him. Dil finally kills Jude with a shot in the neck. Dil then points the gun at Fergus, but lowers her hand, saying that she cannot kill him, because Jody will not allow her to. Fergus prevents Dil from shooting herself, and tells her to hide out in the club for a while. When Dil is gone, he wipes Dil's fingerprints off the gun and allows himself to be arrested in place of Dil. The epilogue takes place a few months later – Fergus, in prison, is visited by Dil. Dil, after talking with Fergus about plans once he gets out of jail, asks him why he took the fall for her in the first place. Fergus responds, ""As a man once said, it's in my nature.""

The Guaraní community above the perilous Iguazu Falls has tied a priest to a cross and sent him down the falls to his death. Father Gabriel travels to the falls and plays his oboe. The Guaraní warriors, captivated by the music, allow him to live. Mercenary and slaver Rodrigo Mendoza  makes his living kidnapping natives and selling them to nearby plantations, including the plantation of the Spanish Governor Cabeza . Mendoza subsequently finds his fiancee  and his younger brother Felipe  in bed together. He kills Felipe in a duel. Acquitted of the killing by Cabeza, Mendoza spirals into depression. Father Gabriel visits and challenges Mendoza to undertake a suitable penance. Mendoza accompanies the Jesuits on their return journey, pulling a heavy bundle containing his armour and sword. Father Gabriel's mission is depicted as a place of sanctuary and education for the Guaraní. Moved by the Guaraní's acceptance, Mendoza wishes to help at the mission and Father Gabriel gives him a Bible. Mendoza takes vows and becomes a Jesuit under Father Gabriel and his colleague Father Fielding . The Jesuit missions were safe, because they were protected under Spanish law. The Treaty of Madrid reapportions the land in South America. The land on which the Jesuit missions were located was then transferred to the Portuguese, and the Portuguese law allowed slavery. The Portuguese colonials seek to enslave the natives, and as the independent Jesuit missions might impede this, Papal emissary Cardinal Altamirano , a former Jesuit priest himself, is sent from the Vatican to survey the missions and decide which, if any, should be allowed to remain. Under pressure from both Cabeza and Portuguese Governor, Don Hontar , Cardinal Altamirano is forced to choose the lesser of two evils. If he rules in favour of the colonists, the indigenous peoples will become enslaved; if he rules in favour of the missions, the entire Jesuit Order may be condemned by the Portuguese and the European Catholic Church could fracture. Altamirano visits the missions and is amazed at their industry and success. At Father Gabriel's mission of San Carlos he tries to explain the reasons behind closing the mission and instructs the Guaraní that they must leave. The Guaraní question his authority, and Father Gabriel and Mendoza state their intention to defend the Mission should the plantation owners and colonists attack. They are, however, divided on how to do this, and they debate how to respond to the impending military attack. Father Gabriel believes that violence is a direct crime against God. Mendoza, however, decides to break his vows in order to militarily defend the Mission. Against Father Gabriel's wishes, he teaches the natives the art of war and once more takes up his sword. When a joint Portuguese and Spanish{{discuss}} force attack, the mission is initially defended by Mendoza, Fielding and the Guaraní. They are no match for the military force and Mendoza is shot and fatally wounded. Fielding sacrifices himself by killing the Portuguese commander before he himself is killed. When soldiers enter the mission village, they are slowed by the singing of Father Gabriel and the Guaraní women and children who march in the procession. The soldiers are reluctant to fire at a church service. In spite of this, the Spanish{{discuss}} commander orders the attack and Father Gabriel, the rest of the priests and most of the Guaraní, including women and children, are gunned down. Only a handful escape into the jungle. In a final exchange between Cardinal Altamirano and Don Hontar, Hontar laments that what happened was unfortunate but inevitable because ""we must work in the world; the world is thus."" Altamirano replies, ""No, thus have we made the world. Thus have I made it."" Days later, a canoe of young children return to the scene of the Mission massacre and salvage a few belongings.

His predecessor on the project and Lang's long-term aide, Mike McAra, died in an apparent accident. The writer travels to the fictional Massachusetts village of Old Haven on Martha's Vineyard, where Lang is staying with his wife, Ruth , and a staff of servants and security personnel. The writer is checked into a small hotel. Lang's personal assistant , Amelia Bly , forbids him to take McAra's manuscript outside, emphasizing that it is a security risk. Shortly after the writer's arrival, Lang is accused by former Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart  of authorising the illegal seizure of suspected terrorists and handing them over for torture by the CIA, a possible war crime. Lang faces prosecution by the International Criminal Court unless he stays in the U.S. or any other country that does not recognise the court's jurisdiction. As reporters and protesters swarm the island, the writer is moved into McAra's old room at Lang's house, where personal belongings have not been cleared out yet. Lang travels to Washington while the writer clears the room, finding an envelope containing clues suggesting McAra may have stumbled on a dark secret. Among the material is a handwritten phone number. During a bicycle ride around the island, the writer encounters an old man  who tells him that the current couldn't have taken McAra's body from the ferry where he disappeared to the beach where it was discovered. He reveals that a neighbour saw flashlights on the beach the night the body was discovered, but later fell off a ladder and went into a coma. The writer is later intercepted by Ruth and her security guard, who take him back to the estate. There, Ruth admits that Lang has never been very political, and until recently had always taken her advice. When the writer tells her the old man's story, she suddenly rushes out into the rainy night to ""clear her head."" Upon returning, she confides in the writer that Lang and McAra had argued the night before he died. She and the writer end up sleeping together. The next morning, the writer decides he is getting too intimate with his subject and moves back to the hotel. After finding some photos of Lang's college days, driving McAra's car, he uses pre-programmed directions on the vehicle's GPS that lead him to Belmont, at the estate of Professor Paul Emmett . Emmett denies anything more than a cursory acquaintance with Lang, despite the writer showing him two photographs of the two of them, as well as another one on the wall of his study. When the writer tells Emmett that the GPS directions to Emmett's house were programmed the night McAra died and that his predecessor visited him, Emmett denies any knowledge and becomes evasive. The writer leaves Emmett's estate, and he is followed by a car, but manages to elude it. The writer boards the ferry, but when he sees the car that had followed him drive aboard, with two men looking for him, he flees the boat at the last moment and checks into a small motel by the ferry dock. Not knowing who to turn to, the writer dials the handwritten phone number, only to discover it belongs to Rycart, who inquires about his whereabouts and indicates he'll pick him up. While waiting for Rycart, the writer does a Google search on Emmett and finds that, in addition to being a Pulitzer Prize-winning professor, he is linked with a military contractor through his think tank. He also finds leads that connect Emmett to the CIA as far back as the 1970s, when the agency recruited academics for the creation of propaganda material to be used abroad. When Rycart arrives, he tells the writer that McAra supplied him with documents linking Lang to torture flights. He also reveals that McAra had found something new before he died, confiding to Rycart that in case anything happened, the clues would be in the ""beginning"" of the book. The men cannot, however, find anything in the manuscript's early pages. The writer the reveals all of the information he found about Emmet, theorizing that he recruited Lang, to which Rycart agrees, saying that, for all his tenure as Prime Minister, all of Lang's decisions were aimed at helping the U.S. When the writer is summoned to accompany Lang on the return flight, he confronts Lang and accuses him of being a CIA agent recruited by Emmett and tells him that McAra was outing him out with Rycart. Lang derides his suggestions. Upon alighting the aircraft, Lang is assassinated by a British anti-war protestor, who is in turn shot by Lang's bodyguards. The writer is questioned by U.S. authorities as a prime witness, his passport withheld, though later recovered by his publicist. Despite Lang's death, the writer is asked to complete the book for posthumous publication, as in light of the recent events, it will be a best-seller. During the book's launch party in London, Amelia unwittingly tells the writer that the Americans tightened access to the book, as the ""beginnings"" contained evidence that threatened national security. She also tells him that Emmett was Ruth's tutor when she was a Fulbright scholar in Harvard. The writer realises that the clues were hidden in the original manuscript at the beginning of each chapter, and discovers the message, ""Lang's wife Ruth was recruited as a CIA agent by Professor Paul Emmett of Harvard University."" Ruth shaped Lang's every political decision to benefit the United States, under direction from the CIA. The writer passes a note to Ruth telling of his discovery. She unfolds the note, and is devastated. When she sees the writer raising a glass, she is kept from following him by Emmett and other assistants. As the writer leaves the party he attemps to take a taxi, without success, and as he crosses the street off-camera, a car accelerates in his direction, and sound effects and flying papers indicate that he has been hit.london, england cia based on novel or book war crimes massachusetts author martha's vineyard",False,tt1139328,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,60222298,0,0,0.3382732888888889,-2.2977368060284267,-5521744.5,21978255.5,35497925.875,97122925.875,,,17908218.333333332,14,45285996.11111111,9.0,231138202.85714287,18.0,307281060.0,7.0,-1569178.0,18.0,5430822.0,1.0,24167840.333333332,14.0,61967840.333333336,3.0,98382400.22222222,15.0,126441586.1111111,9.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,36464644.5,61464644.5,2.0,62572603.4,112572603.4,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,24676362.666666668,54676362.666666664,3.0,38583141.5,81083141.5,2.0,239111994.42857143,340683423.0,7.0,,,,24676362.666666668,54676362.666666664,3.0,38583141.5,81083141.5,2.0,15428252.25,44678252.25,4.0,61286096.0,76286096.0,1.0,53054446.0,70554446.0,2.0,,,,69984862.0,102984862.0,1.0,,,,-12354673.0,20645327.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,38583141.5,81083141.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,109281460.91111112,74005496.74920635,9.875,5.8,102557850.13709407

Barkin, a roguish Collie/German Shepherd mix with a con man's charm, is working with his gangster business partner, Carface Carruthers, at a casino fashioned out of a derelict oil tanker. Not sharing the earnings, Carface frames Charlie and has him sent to a pound, but Charlie escapes with the help of his best friend Itchy Itchiford. Later, Carface and his sidekick, Killer, kill Charlie by hitting him with an empty automobile. Charlie, however, goes to heaven by default, despite never actually performing any good deeds, because of the movie's namesake rule of the afterlife: All dogs go to Heaven. Charlie cheats death by stealing his ""life watch"", a glowing pocket watch, and winding it back up, allowing him to return to Earth. As Charlie leaves Heaven, a Whippet Angel warns him that he can never return to heaven. Therefore, it is assumed that if he dies he will automatically go to hell. However, Charlie quickly learns that his life is now tied to the ""life watch,"" which means that as long as the watch is protected and operating, Charlie will live. Back on Earth, Charlie reunites with Itchy and plots his revenge against Carface by setting up a rival business. Itchy reveals to Charlie that Carface has a Monster. Charlie decides to investigate the monster, however, it is revealed that Carface is imprisoning a little orphan girl named Anne-Marie for her ability to communicate with animals, giving him an advantage when betting on races, which are apparently fixed so that those who speak the racing animals' language can know in advance of the outcome. Charlie ""rescues"" Anne-Marie, telling her that they will help the poor and he will find her a family. Charlie takes Anne-Marie to the local Horse Track, where a pensive Anne-Marie doesn't want to talk. When Charlie says the money is for the poor, like in Robin Hood, Anne-Marie agrees to help. After a time, Anne-Marie becomes upset due to Charlie not looking for Parents. Charlie begins to make a large profit using Anne-Marie, who eventually attempts to leave when she realizes Charlie was using her in the same way that Carface was, but Charlie convinces Anne-Marie to stay by his side by promising to give to the poor, resulting in Charlie purchasing Pizza and Cake for an Orphanage of abandoned puppies. Anne-Marie, however, finds the wallet which was stolen by Charlie from the horse race. Anne-Marie angrily corners Charlie accusing him. Anne-Marie then sleeps in the attic. That night, Charlie has a nightmare in which he is banished to hell and is attacked by a Hellhound and its minions. The next day, Anne-Marie goes to return the wallet. Charlie finds her eating breakfast with the Wallet Family, the family whose wallet was stolen, where he discovers that the couple is planning to take Anne-Marie in. Charlie tricks Anne-Marie into leaving by pretending to be sick. After escaping an ambush with Carface and Killer, Charlie and Anne-Marie fall through the floor of an old warehouse into an underground sewer where they narrowly avoid being eaten by King Gator, a giant alligator who befriends them and learns how well Charlie can sing. Meanwhile, Itchy is ambushed by Carface and his thugs, who destroy Charlie's Casino. Charlie brings Anne-Marie to the church, where a beaten Itchy accuses Charlie of caring more for Anne-Marie than him or their business. Frustrated, Charlie says that he never actually cared about the girl. Anne-Marie overhears them, however, and runs away into a thunderstorm, and into the clutches of Carface. Charlie goes to the casino/boat to rescue Anne-Marie, where Carface and others captures him. Itchy is given instructions to warn the Wallet Family about Anne-Marie's capture, which results in the neighborhood dogs collaborating to get the message to the family. Charlie is ambushed by Carface's thugs, who attempt to tie him to a boat anchor. However, when one of the thugs bites Charlie's foot, making him howl, King Gator comes to their rescue, frees Charlie and eats Carface. Anne-Marie falls into the water, along with Charlie's watch. Charlie dives in to save Anne-Marie and the watch, but cannot get both. Charlie places Anne-Marie on a board and pushes her to safety. Charlie then attempts to swim to his watch, but is unsuccessful, resulting in him drowning. Anne-Marie ends up with her new family and Charlie is allowed back into heaven, instead of hell, since he sacrificed himself to save his friend. He gives his heartfelt goodbyes to Anne-Marie and Itchy, finally proving his love for her. Leaving Itchy in her care, Charlie finally departs for the afterlife, where he finds  that Carface has also ended up in heaven and attempts to use his clock to return home like Charlie did. The Whippet Angel chases him down warning him that he will never return, but Charlie emerges from a cloud and assures the audience that Carface's escape will not last long.new orleans, usa heaven german shepherd second chance",True,tt0096787,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,27100027,0,0,0.963770072463768,-0.030070667040354673,93918947.63636364,108221220.36363636,16224332.57142857,31924332.57142857,,,,0,,,-4966603.0,3.0,8033397.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,50311435.5,61561435.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,124167015.0,156167015.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8033397.0,-4966603.0,0.375,1.0,88766264.70698021

Merlin and Arthur have one final conversation before Merlin vanishes. The wizard then appears to Morgana as a shadow and tricks her into uttering the Charm of Making, producing a fog from the breath of the Dragon, and exhausting her own magical powers which had kept her young. She rapidly ages, and her own son, repulsed by the sight of his once beautiful mother now reduced to a decrepit old crone, kills her. Arthur and Mordred's forces meet in battle, with Arthur's side benefiting from the fog which conceals the smallness of their army. Lancelot unexpectedly arrives and turns the tide of battle.

With names such as Mustique, Sateen Lips, Baby Blonde and Glitter Gal, the doll heads not only engage in long conversations with Jeliza-Rose, reflecting different aspects of the girl's psyche, but also act as her companions while she explores the barren Texas landscape. After her mother  overdoses on drugs, Jeliza-Rose and her father, Noah , flee Los Angeles to Noah's mother's home, a remote Texas farmhouse. Noah fears that with all the drugs in their house he will lose Jeliza-Rose and be sent to prison, so he attempts to set it alight before they leave, although Jeliza-Rose manages to stop him. They find the farmhouse abandoned, but they settle in anyway. Their first night there, Noah dies from a heroin overdose. For much of the rest of the film, Noah's corpse remains seated upright in a living room chair with sunglasses covering his eyes. As her father slowly begins to decompose, Jeliza-Rose doesn't readily acknowledge his death because she has grown accustomed to him being unconscious for long periods at a time. Instead, she retreats deeper and deeper into her own mind, exploring the tall grass around the farmhouse, relying on her doll heads for friendship as an unconscious way of keeping herself from feeling too lonely and afraid. During Jeliza-Rose's wanderings, she eventually encounters and befriends her neighbors, a mentally impaired young man called Dickens  and his older sister Dell  who is blind in one eye from a bee sting. At this point the story begins to unfold, revealing a past connection between Dell and Jeliza-Rose's deceased father. The eccentric neighbors take the girl under their wing, going so far as to preserve Noah's body via taxidermy . Amorous feelings, initiated mostly by the much younger Jeliza-Rose, begin to creep into the childlike relationship between her and Dickens, and it is revealed that the deeply troubled Dickens, a man-child who once drove a school bus in front of an oncoming train, keeps a stash of dynamite in his bedroom that he intends to use against the Land-Shark he believes is roaming the countryside. The Land-Shark is, in reality, the nightly passenger train that travels past the farmhouse where Jeliza-Rose and her dead father reside. What follows is literally an explosive conclusion to the film, one in which Dickens blasts a hole into the real world by dynamiting the train from its tracks, creating a scene of chaos near the farmhouse.

With only a few days to his execution, his lawyer negotiates a half million-dollar fee to tell his story to Bitsey Bloom , a journalist from a major news magazine known for her ability to keep secrets and protect her sources. He tells her the story of how he ended up on death row, revealed to the movie audience through a series of lengthy flashbacks. Gale is head of the philosophy department at the University of Texas and an active member of DeathWatch, a group campaigning against capital punishment. He loses a televised debate with the Governor of Texas when he is unable to point to an example of a demonstrably innocent man being executed. Later, a graduation party, he encounters Berlin , an attractive female graduate student who had been expelled from the school, corners the inebriated Gale and succeeds in getting him to have rough sex with her. She then falsely accuses Gale of rape. Later, she drops the charges and flees, but the negative publicity costs Gale his career, marriage, and reputation. Constance Harraway , a fellow DeathWatch activist, is a close friend of Gale's who consoles him after his life fall apart. However, Harraway is found raped and murdered, suffocated by a plastic bag taped over her head. An autopsy reveals that she had been forced to swallow the key of the handcuffs used to restrain her, a psychological torture technique utilized under the communist regime of Nicolae Ceauşescu, which Gale and Harraway had both protested against. The physical evidence at the crime scene points to Gale, who is convicted of her rape and murder and is, ironically, sentenced to death. In the present, Bloom investigates the case in between her visits with Gale. She comes to believe that the apparent evidence against Gale does not add up. She is also tailed several times in her car by a figure who turns out to be Dusty Wright , the alleged one-time lover and colleague of Harraway's. Wright slips evidence to Bloom that suggests Gale has been framed, implying that the ""real"" murderer videotaped the crime. Bloom pursues this lead until she finds a tape revealing that Harraway, who was suffering from terminal leukemia, had committed an elaborate suicide to look like murder. She and Wright are both seen on the videotape, showing that they framed Gale as part of a plan to discredit the death penalty. Bloom does not find this evidence until the day of Gale's scheduled execution. In a frenzy, she tries to give the tape to the authorities in time to stop the execution. She arrives at the prison just as the warden announces that it has already been carried out. The tape is then released, causing a media and political uproar over the execution of an innocent man. Later, Wright receives the fee that Bloom's magazine agreed to pay for the interview, and delivers it to Gale's ex-wife in Spain, along with a postcard from Berlin apologizing for the false rape accusation. His ex-wife looks distraught, knowing Gale told the truth and that she effectively stole their child away from him. Much later still, a videotape labeled ""Off the Record"" is delivered to Bloom. This tape picks up at the point where Wright confirmed that Harraway was dead, then continues on to show him stepping aside to allow Gale, also present and party to the suicide, to caress her body. It was in doing this that Gale left his fingerprints on Harraway's plastic suffocation bag. The plot has some parallels with the 1999 Clint Eastwood drama True Crime, but with a different outcome.prison journalist texas professor death penalty death row interview murder reporter intern innocent activist",False,tt0289992,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,38955598,1,0,-0.283512577576142,-14.415123713336484,,,68445525.54545455,102468252.81818181,-5250295.714285715,22678275.714285713,2315140.0,2,50315140.0,1.0,18951760.2,8.0,30951760.2,5.0,-4835596.0,3.0,5164404.0,1.0,,0.0,,,18900000.0,1.0,25900000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-33326758.0,26673242.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21472103.5,28622103.5,2.0,,,,-3347421.0,17619245.666666668,3.0,-5762530.0,9237470.0,1.0,279017.0,8279017.0,1.0,,,,31913689.666666668,41013689.666666664,3.0,77931989.0,95931989.0,2.0,,,,2315140.0,50315140.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,32700000.0,35000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,32700000.0,35000000.0,1.0,,,,18870417.25,41914167.25,16.0,,,28082826.05,8832826.05,1.75,2.0,79569518.43496008

While his owners are away on holiday Roddy plays around the house. When a common sewer rat named Sid  comes spewing out of the sink and decides to stay, especially as England are playing against Germany in the World Cup final, Roddy schemes to get rid of Sid by luring him into the ""jacuzzi"", which is actually the toilet. Sid isn't fooled however, and instead pushes Roddy in and flushes him away into the sewer. There, Roddy discovers an city resembling London made out of various bits of junk, and meets Rita Malone , an enterprising scavenger rat who works the drains in her faithful boat, the Jammy Dodger. Rita does not like Roddy initially, but ends up taking him along, while her arch enemy The Toad  sends his rat henchmen, Spike  and Whitey , after her because she had stolen back her father's prized ruby a long time ago. The Toad despises all rodents to the point of hateful obsession. He decides to have them frozen with liquid nitrogen inside an icemaker. The pair escape, and Rita takes a unique electrical cable. The cable is required to control the Floodgates.  Roddy finds that the ruby is a fake and breaks it in front of Rita, enraging her, for she can now not get the money she needs for her large family. Roddy offers her a real ruby if she takes him back to Kensington. Accepting the offer, the pair first stop to visit her family before setting off. During Roddy's stay, he overhears a conversation that causes him to think that Rita had double-crossed him, so he steals the Jammy Dodger. When Rita catches up to him, she is able to clear up the misunderstanding. The pair evade Spike and Whitey pursuing in a remote-controlled toy boat, with Thimblenose Ted and others on eggbeater jet skis. During this scene, Roddy and Rita share a quick love moment. Incensed at his minions’ repeated failures, The Toad sends for his French cousin; an infamous, if somewhat laid back, mercenary known as Le Frog . During this scene, it is revealed that The Toad was once Prince Charles' pet, but was replaced by a pet mouse, and subsequently flushed down a toilet. Le Frog and his subordinates intercept the duo and retrieve the cable, but Roddy and Rita use a plastic bag to lift themselves out of the sewer  and get Roddy home, though the Jammy Dodger has to be sacrificed. Back home, Roddy pays Rita the promised ruby and an emerald, then proceeds to show her around his house. She at first believes he has family in the home, but noticing his cage, she realizes he's a pet. Roddy tries to pass Sid off as his brother, but Sid and Rita know each other, and so she doesn't fall for it. Rita tries to persuade Roddy to come with her, but he is too proud to admit that he is lonely. By now, they have fallen in love but have not told each other their feelings. She departs, both of them broken-hearted, but is soon captured by The Toad. Talking to Sid about half-time, Roddy pieces together The Toad's plan: to open the gates during halftime of the World Cup, when all the humans will most likely be using their toilets, causing a great flood and drowning the rats and their underground city in sewage. He can then use the depopulated city as a home for millions of his own tadpole offspring. He gives Sid his cushy position and has him flush him back to the sewers to find Rita and save the city. Together, they defeat The Toad and freeze the wave of sewage generated by the flushing of countless toilets during half-time with liquid nitrogen before it drowns the entire rat population. Rita and Roddy build the Jammy Dodger Mark Two and set off in her with Rita's entire brood. A newspaper article reveals England had lost on penalties. Rita and Roddy become boyfriend and girlfriend.

At this time, two new races appeared: the Skeksis, vulture-like tyrants using the power of the ""Dark Crystal"" to continually replenish themselves, and hunchbacked natural wizards called Mystics. Jen, an elf-like Gelfling taken in by the Mystics after his clan was killed, is told by his Mystic master that he must find the crystal shard, and that it can be found in the home of Aughra. If he fails to do so before the three suns meet, the Skeksis will rule forever. The Skeksis' emperor and Jen's master die simultaneously. A confrontation ensues between a Skeksis called the Chamberlain and another called the General, who both desire to succeed him. The General becomes emperor and the Chamberlain is exiled. Learning of Jen's existence, the Skeksis send large crab-like creatures called Garthim to track him. Jen reaches Aughra and is taken to her home, which contains an enormous orrery she uses to predict the motions of the heavens. Jen discovers the crystal shard by playing music on his flute to which it resonates. Jen is told of the upcoming Great Conjunction when the three suns will align, but he learns little of its connection to the shard. The Garthim destroys Aughra's home and Jen flees, but Aughra is taken prisoner. Hearing the calls of the crystal, the Mystics leave their valley to travel to the Castle. Jen meets Kira, another surviving Gelfling who can communicate with animals, and her pet Fizzgig. They discover that they have a telepathic connection which Kira calls ""dreamfasting"". They stay for a night with the Podlings who raised Kira after the death of her parents. However, the Garthim attacks the village and Kira, Jen, and Fizzgig flee when the Chamberlain prevents one of the Garthim from attacking them. Most of the Podlings are enslaved. Jen and Kira discover a ruined Gelfling city. Finding a relief, Jen reads the Crystal's prophecy: the shard, a part of the Dark Crystal, must be reinserted to restore the Crystal's integrity. The Chamberlain tells Jen and Kira that he wishes to bring them to the Skeksis to make peace, but they refuse. Riding on Landstriders, the Gelflings arrive at the Castle of the Crystal, where they see the Garthim that attacked Kira's village. Kira and Jen unsuccessfully attempt to free the captured Podlings. Kira, Jen and Fizzgig jump off the cliff and infiltrate the lower parts of the Castle. The Chamberlain confronts them again and tries to convince them to make peace; however, Kira is captured and Jen strikes the Chamberlain on his hand using the crystal shard. The Chamberlain wounds Jen and takes Kira to the Castle. The General restores the Chamberlain to his former position. On the suggestion of the Skeksis' resident scientist, the General decides to regain his youth by draining Kira's life essence,Henson Productions; ""The wicked Skeksis live off of the essence of others..."" recalling that its potency allows a Skeksis emperor to maintain his youth for longer periods than that of the Podlings on whom they have been forced to rely since the Gelfling genocide. Kira maintains a telepathic connection with Jen, who tells her to call out to the animals imprisoned in the laboratory. They break free from their cages and the Skeksis scientist falls to his death, upon which one of the Mystics simultaneously vanishes. Kira, Jen, and Aughra flee, but they are separated from Fizzgig during a confrontation with the Garthim. The three suns begin to align as the two Gelflings reconvene in the Crystal chamber. The Skeksis arrive to prepare for the immortality that they will gain from the Conjunction if the Crystal is not restored. Jen is discovered and drops the shard, but Kira throws it back to him and is stabbed to death by the Skeksis' high priest. Jen inserts the shard into the Crystal, unifying it as the Mystics enter the chamber. As Aughra, Jen and Fizzgig watch, the Mystics and Skeksis merge into tall glowing beings, one of whom says ""we are again one"", speaks to Jen of their history, and revives Kira. After leaving the Crystal for the two Gelflings to ""make [their] world in its light,"" the beings depart, and the land is shown rejuvenated and the Castle transformed into a palace of crystal.liberation castle mythical creature mission puppetry fantasy world crystal",False,tt0083791,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,40577001,0,0,1.7051333999999998,3.674315067367597,14687646.8,21587646.8,,,36833347.0,41833347.0,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,23967437.0,34967437.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16966599.333333332,21933266.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,59166201.5,63726201.5,2.0,,,,,,,136458706.0,190458706.0,1.0,,,,19184292.333333332,25184292.333333332,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,64653273.14837625

Initially, he sets strict rules for himself regarding whom he should follow and for how long, but soon discards them as he focuses on a well-groomed, handsome man in a dark suit. The man in the suit, having noticed he is being followed, quickly confronts the Young Man and introduces himself as ""Cobb"". Cobb reveals that he is a serial burglar and invites The Young Man to accompany him on various burglaries. The material gains from these crimes seem to be of secondary importance to Cobb, who takes pleasure in rifling through the personal items in his targets' flats, and doing things such as drinking their wine. He explains that his true passion is using the shock of robbery and violation of property to make his victims re-examine their lives. He sums up his attitude thus: ""You take it away, and show them what they had."" The Young Man is thrilled by Cobb's lifestyle. He attempts break-ins of his own, as Cobb encourages and guides him. At Cobb's suggestion, he alters his appearance, cutting his hair short and wearing a dark suit. The Young Man assumes the name ""Daniel Lloyd"" based on the credit card Cobb gives to him and begins to pursue a relationship with a blonde woman whose flat he and Cobb burglarized. The Blonde turns out to be the girlfriend of a small-time gangster  whom she broke up with after he murdered a man in her flat. Soon, the Blonde confides that the Bald Guy is blackmailing her with incriminating photographs. The Young Man breaks into the Bald Guy's safe, but is caught in the act by an unidentified man. The Young Man bludgeons the man with a claw hammer and flees with the Bald Guy's money and photos. Upon returning to his flat, he finds that the photos are innocuous modeling shots. Confronting the Blonde, the Young Man learns that she and Cobb have been working together to manipulate him into mimicking Cobb's burglary methods. Cobb had recently discovered a murdered woman's body during one of his burglaries, and is attempting to deflect suspicion from himself by making it appear as though multiple burglars share his MO. The Young Man leaves to turn himself in to the police. The Blonde reports her success to Cobb, who then reveals that he actually works for the Bald Guy. The story about the murdered woman was part of a plot to deceive both the Blonde and the Young Man: The Blonde has been blackmailing the Bald Guy with evidence from the murder he committed in her flat, and he wants her murdered in such a way that it cannot be connected to him. Cobb bludgeons the Blonde to death with the same claw hammer that the Young Man used during the burglary of the Bald Guy's safe and leaves it at the scene. The police, checking out the Young Man's story, find the Blonde murdered and the claw hammer with his finger prints on it. The Young Man is implicated for all of Cobb's crimes, along with the murder of the blonde woman. Meanwhile, Cobb vanishes into a crowd.london, england robbery burglar prosecution thief independent film writer stranger neo-noir",False,tt0154506,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,48482,0,0,7.080333333333333,15.965307217698705,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,73407251.10798967

On his way home Shaun runs into a group of young skinheads led by Woody, who feels sympathy for Shaun and invites him to join the group. They accept Shaun as a member and he finds a big brother in Woody, while developing a romance with Smell, an older girl who dresses in a new wave style. Combo, an older skinhead, returns to the group after a prison sentence, accompanied by a knife-wielding bearded man called Banjo, and a bespectacled diabetic called Meggy. A charismatic but unstable individual with sociopathic tendencies, Combo expresses English nationalist and racist views, and attempts to enforce his leadership over the other skinheads. This leads the group to split. Shaun stays in Combo's group instead of the apolitical skinheads led by Woody. Combo is impressed by and identifies with Shaun, who in turn sees Combo as a mentor figure. Shaun goes with Combo's group to a National Front meeting. After group member Pukey expresses doubt over the group's racist and nationalistic politics, Combo threatens and abandons him. The gang then engages in racist antagonism of, among others, local shopkeeper Mr. Sandhu, a Pakistani man who had previously banned Shaun from his shop. Combo becomes depressed after Woody's girlfriend Lol, whom Combo has loved since they had drunken sex years before, rejects him. To console himself, Combo buys cannabis from Milky, a member of Woody's group, and the only black skinhead. At a party with Shaun and the other members of Combo's group, Combo and Milky bond while intoxicated. Combo invites Milky to tell him about himself. Milky describes his many relatives and comfortable family life to Combo who listens with increasing jealousy. When Milky invites him to dinner, Combo becomes enraged and nearly beats Milky to death whilst everyone in the room, including Shaun watches in horror. Ashamed and devastated by what he has done to Milky, Combo then turns hysterical, violently dragging the others out of the room and glassing Banjo in the face, covering Meggy in blood. Shaun returns, and he and Combo are shown crying and panicking whilst dragging Milky to a nearby hospital. The film cuts forward to Shaun back in his room brooding about the whole event, with his mother assuring Shaun that Milky will be alright. Shaun is then shown walking near the beach throwing his Saint George Flag in the sea as a tribute to his father who died for what England was really about and not the racist views of the National Front.holiday skinhead england vandalism nottingham gang racism summer youth violence drugs falklands war cult film unemployment xenophobia culture 1980s",False,tt0480025,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,8176544,1,0,2.43552268907563,-3.847336948521819,,,-1413640.6,8526359.4,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-1173477.0,20.0,2826523.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,101183863.0,171183863.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,-4816403.0,1383597.0,2.0,21923224.5,27923224.5,2.0,,,,,,,279017.0,8279017.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2826523.0,-1173477.0,2.5,1.0,92887866.92008553

Eventually, he is contacted by Raymond Price , who claims that his own son had also died. He says he has recorded messages from Anna through Electronic voice phenomena . While Jonathan is initially dismissive and angered he later learns about his wife's tragic drowning. Desperate, he begins to believe that the recorded voice is indeed that of his wife. Jonathan becomes obsessed with trying to contact her himself, despite warnings from a psychic who tries to tell him how the recording can attract other, unwanted entities. A woman named Sarah Tate  befriends Jonathan because she lost her fiancé. Raymond is found dead. Jonathan begins to be followed by three demons attracted by his obsession with EVP, and finds that some of the messages he is coming across are from people who are not yet dead, but may soon be. Jonathan then hears cries from a woman who he finds in a car with a child. He is able to save the child, but not the woman. At the funeral, which Jonathan and Sarah both attend, Jonathan approaches the husband and tells him about what happened. The husband thanks Jonathan for saving his son but then asks him to leave them alone. The husband continues to tell Jonathan to stay away from him and his family. Afterwards, Jonathan sees images of another person, a missing woman named Mary Freeman, while working with his EVP devices. Sarah is later seriously injured by a fall from a balcony while possessed by the demons. Jonathan locates the site of his wife's death by following signs on recordings, and finds a construction worker from his company holding Mary captive. The three demons torture Jonathan by breaking his arms and legs and cause him to fall to his death, but a SWAT team along with Detective Smits  arrives and are able to save Mary by shooting the construction worker. After his funeral, Jonathan's voice can be heard on the radio through static interference saying ""I'm sorry"" to his son. The child recognizes the voice and smiles.

Tough, he earns a wildcard spot to the Wimbledon tournament, but internally feels that it's time to admit he's getting too old to compete with fitter coming men  and intends, after this last Wimbledon, to take a job with the prestigious tennis club instead. However, as Wimbledon begins, by accident, he bumps into Lizzie Bradbury , the American rising star of female tennis, falls in love with her and finds her interest in him changes his entire perception, even gives him the strength to win again. As their love grows, Peter's game becomes better and better, but her game starts worsening as she spends too much time with Peter, ignoring her practice and tiredness. However, her overprotective father-manager Dennis Bradbury  proves determined to nip their relationship in the bud, believing it detrimental to her career. One day, Dennis comes to Peter’s old flat and yells at him for spoiling his daughter's game. She overhears this and decides to leave him and focus on her game. Both of them play several games with different opponents and win. But without Lizzie’s support, Peter's confidence and concentration start to shake. Lizzie enters into semi-final while Peter also manages to reach semi-final but with difficulty. The night before their semi-final games, Peter sneaks into Lizzie’s hotel room and persuades her to have sex. Initially, she denies as she requires more rest and sleep for her semi-final game next morning, but later on agrees to. Next day, he performs quite well and wins his semi-final match in straight sets, whilst Lizzie loses her match due to tiredness for lack of sleep and losing her focus after last night together with Peter. Lizzie gets upset and breaks their relationship while accusing his madness and last night greed for sex as cause for loss of her match, her dreams and perhaps her career too. She leaves before he can say or explain anything and decides to immediately return to USA. Peter has to play the final match against Jake Hammond , an arrogant American star who Peter has already had an argument with involving Lizzie, but finds himself out classed. At the airport, Lizzie watches an interview on TV in which Peter apologizes to her and declares his love for her openly. She drops her idea to go home, and comes back to Wimbledon. Before Lizzie reaches the stadium, Peter has already lost two sets and is running behind in the third one due to the fast and forceful tricky serves by Jake. He has lost all of his focus due to the breakup with Lizzie. Before the game is interrupted by rain, his back muscles get stressed and he has started thinking about quitting the game rather than face a sure defeat. Suddenly, Lizzie comes to him in the dressing room and tells him that she has forgiven him, and prepares him to play and face the fate rather than quit. She tells him the secret about Jake’s tricky serves. With Lizzie cheering him on, Peter makes a recovery in the game and wins the title  with a diving volley. After the game he retires from tennis. He and Lizzie get married, and with his support, Lizzie goes on to win the U.S. Open and Wimbledon twice, ultimately achieving her dreams. In the last scene, Peter is with their youngest child, a boy, watching Lizzie and their eldest child, a girl, playing tennis together on a neighborhood court in New York City.tennis new love tennis player australia sport wimbledon",False,tt0360201,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,41512007,0,0,0.339097,1.9257596443831189,69206642.22222222,105595531.1111111,,,,,-3353006.0,3,3646994.0,1.0,-586540.5,6.0,8413459.5,2.0,-33326758.0,7.0,26673242.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-9993372.5,20.0,4506627.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,36766126.5,80766126.5,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-5000666.0,4199334.0,1.0,,,,,,,-28716363.0,28283637.0,1.0,90776428.8,119962428.8,10.0,,,,17966644.0,20966644.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,49629958.5,78629958.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,10810080.75,-11814919.25,4.5,1.5,84824632.31357588

All animals lived harmoniously, but the rabbits eventually multiplied, and their appetite led to a food shortage. At the prayers of the desperate animals, Frith warned the rabbit prince El-ahrairah to control his people, but was scoffed at. In retaliation, Frith gave special gifts to every animal, but some animals he made predators to prey upon the rabbits. Satisfied that El-ahrairah had learned his lesson, Frith also gave the rabbits speed and cunning; while many would seek to kill them, the rabbits could survive by their wits and quickness. In the present, in the English countryside of Sandleford, Fiver, a rabbit seer has an apocalyptic vision and goes with his older brother Hazel to beg the chief to have the warren evacuated, but they are dismissed and attempt to make an exodus themselves. The group meets resistance from the warren's police force called the Owsla, but eight manage to fight and escape, including Fiver, Hazel, Bigwig, Blackberry, Pipkin, Dandelion, Silver and Violet. They travel through the dangerous woods and make it to a bean field to rest. In the morning, Violet is killed by a hawk, leaving the group without a female. After several dangerous situations, they meet the enigmatic rabbit Cowslip, who invites them to his warren. They are grateful, but Fiver senses something bizarre in the atmosphere, and the resident rabbits' overly resigned attitudes, and leaves. An irked Bigwig follows, and chastises Fiver for supposedly causing senseless tension with his instincts. Moments later, however, he is caught in a snare trap. Fiver attempts to get help from their hosts, but is ignored. Bigwig is freed after nearly dying. As Fiver reveals, the warren is fed by a farmer who snares rabbits in return for his food and protection from predators. After Bigwig's narrow escape, the other rabbits willingly follow Fiver's and Hazel's advice and set out once more. The rabbits discover Nuthanger farm, which contains a hutch of female rabbits, necessary for a new warren. However, they do not manage to free them, on account of the territorial farm animals. They find the injured Owsla captain Holly, who recounts the destruction of Sandleford by humans, and a mysterious group called the ""Efrafrans"" before falling unconscious. Fiver finally leads the group to the hill he envisioned, Watership Down, where the rabbits settle. They settle in, developing their own warren, with Hazel as chief. They befriend an acerbic injured seagull, Kehaar, who offers to survey the local area for does. The rabbits return to Nuthanger to free the does; Hazel is shot by a farmhand and presumed dead, but Fiver has a vision and follows the apparition of the Black Rabbit of Inle to his injured brother. Kehaar returns and while removing buckshot pellets from Hazel's leg, reports of Efrafa, a large warren with many females. Holly, who encountered Efrafa, begs them not to go there, describing it as a totalitarian state, run by vicious and heavily territorial rabbits. Hazel feels they have no choice but to go there. Bigwig infiltrates the colony and becomes an Owsla officer by the cruel chief, General Woundwort. Bigwig recruits several potential escapees to his cause, including Hyzenthlay, an idealistic doe and Blackavar, a scarred attempted escapee. They flee, with Woundwort and his Owsla in pursuit. Using a boat to float down the river, they evade capture. That night, Keehar leaves for his homeland, with the gratitude of the warren. Several days later, Efrafan trackers discover their trail and follow them to Watership Down. Hazel offers a treaty with Woundwort, who dismisses Hazel, telling him to have Bigwig and the deserters surrender. The Watership rabbits barricade their warren and are besieged by the Efrafans. Fiver slips into a trance, in which he envisions a dog loose in the woods. His moans inspire Hazel to free the dog from Nuthanger and lead him to the warren to intervene. He escapes with Blackberry, Dandelion and Hyzenthlay. Hazel prays to Frith, offering his life for the those in the warren, a bargain Frith acknowledges, but doesn't accept, as the outcome is ultimately up to Hazel. Hazel frees the dog while his companions bait it into following them to Watership Down. When the Efrafans break through the warren's defences, Woundwort leads the attack. Blackavar confronts Woundwort, but is overpowered and killed. Bigwig ambushes Woundwort and they fight to exhaustion. The dog arrives and kills the Efrafan soldiers. Hearing the commotion, Woundwort abandons Bigwig and confronts the dog. No trace of Woundwort is found, leaving his fate ambiguous. Years later, the warren is thriving. An elderly Hazel is visited by the Black Rabbit, who invites him to join his Owsla, assuring him of Watership Down's perpetual safety. Reassured, Hazel accepts and dies.

The Lugash Secret Police are brought in to investigate, and the Shah of Lugash requests the assistance of Inspector Clouseau . Clouseau has been demoted to beat cop by his boss, Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus , who despises Clouseau to the point of obsession. However, the French government forces Dreyfus to reinstate Clouseau as Inspector of the Sûreté so that he can go to Lugash to investigate the theft of the Pink Panther. Clouseau's investigations at the Lugash National Museum, which he nearly destroys, lead him to believe that Sir Charles Lytton , the notorious Phantom, is re-creating the most famous heist of his career. Clouseau is delighted at this, and sees his chance to get revenge on Lytton for framing him and temporarily sending him to prison in the first film. Sir Charles, having read about the theft, realizes that he has been framed. He goes to Lugash to investigate and clear his name. Although Clouseau fails to uncover any leads concerning the theft, his bumbling allows him to survive several attempts on his life by a mysterious assassin. After staking out  Lytton Manor in Nice, Clouseau is tricked into leaving France. He follows Sir Charles' wife, Lady Claudine  to a resort hotel in Gstaad, Switzerland, where his attempts to investigate her repeatedly fail. Meanwhile, Sir Charles manages to discover the identity of the true thief - his wife . Because they were both bored with their quiet retirement, she stole the diamond for her own excitement, and sent her husband on a wild goose chase. Sir Charles makes a daring escape from Lugash and goes to Gstaad to find his wife and the diamond. Inspector Clouseau, who has unknowingly been on the trail of the real thief all along, receives a telephone call from Chief Inspector Dreyfus telling him to arrest Lady Claudine. However, when Clouseau calls Dreyfus back to ask why, he is informed that Dreyfus has gone on vacation and will not be back until the following week. Dreyfus, now revealed as the assassin trying to kill Clouseau, prepares to shoot him with a sniper rifle as soon as he enters Lady Claudine's room. Lady Claudine playfully confesses the theft to her husband, and hands the diamond over to him, so he can go about proving his innocence. They are cornered by Colonel Sharki  of the Lugash Secret Police, who intends to kill them both. It turns out he has been using the theft of the diamond as an excuse to purge his political opponents. Clouseau barges into the room to arrest the Lyttons. Sir Charles points out that Colonel Sharki is going to kill them all. Suddenly, Dreyfus opens fire on the room, and accidentally kills Sharki while aiming at Clouseau, who ducks at the last minute to check his fly. The Lyttons escape during the fray. For his work in recovering the Pink Panther, Clouseau is promoted to Chief Inspector, and vows to bring Sir Charles to justice. Lady Claudine's fate is not revealed to the audience, but it is implied she was not arrested. Dreyfus is committed to a lunatic asylum, where he is straitjacketed and placed inside a Padded cell, vowing revenge on Clouseau as the animated Pink Panther enters the room.robbery diamond côte d'azur inspector panther farce",False,tt0072081,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,41833347,0,0,7.3666694,44.936812380342076,83263733.54545455,88641006.27272727,,,,,14878330.0,13,20144996.666666668,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-1103000.0,17.0,665000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,107416200.33333333,112749533.66666667,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1051794.0,3251794.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,56700000.0,68700000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,10404998.333333334,6887665.0,3.75,2.0,65707483.04837625

He struggles, due to lack of experience, and becomes a mailroom clerk at Hudsucker Industries. Meanwhile, the company founder and president, Waring Hudsucker, unexpectedly commits suicide by jumping out of a top-floor window. When Sidney J. Mussburger, a ruthless member of the board of directors, learns that Hudsucker's stock shares will be sold to the public soon, he mounts a scheme to buy the controlling interest in the company: he will temporarily depress the stock price by hiring an incompetent president to replace Hudsucker. Shortly before his last meeting, Hudsucker sent Mussburger a top-secret communication called a ""Blue Letter"", which Norville is assigned to deliver. After meeting Norville, Mussburger selects him as a proxy for Hudsucker. Across town, Amy Archer , a brassy Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the Manhattan Argus, is assigned to write a story about Norville and find out what kind of man he really is. She gets a job at Hudsucker Industries as his personal secretary, pretending to be yet another desperate graduate from Muncie. One night, Amy searches the building to find clues and meets Moses, a man who operates the tower's giant clock and knows ""just about anything if it concerns Hudsucker."" He tells her Mussburger's plot and she takes the story back to her Chief, but he does not believe a word of it. The other executives decide to accept Norville's invention for the hula hoop, in the hope that it will depress the company's stock. However, the hula hoop brings the company greater success than before. Amy is infuriated over Norville's new attitude and leaves him. Buzz, the eager elevator operator, pitches a new invention: the flexi-straw. Norville does not like it and fires Buzz. Meanwhile, the Hudsucker janitor, Aloysius, discovers Amy's true identity and informs Mussburger. Mussburger reveals Amy's secret identity to Norville and tells him that he will be dismissed as president after the new year. Mussburger also convinces the board that Norville is insane and must be sent to the local psychiatric hospital. On New Year's Eve, Amy finds Norville drunk at a beatnik bar. She apologizes, but he storms out and is chased by an angry mob led by Buzz, who was led by Mussburger to believe that Norville stole the hula hoop idea. Norville escapes to the top floor of the Hudsucker skyscraper and changes back into his mailroom uniform. He climbs out on the ledge, where Aloysius locks out Norville and watches as he slips and falls off the building at the stroke of midnight. All of a sudden, Moses stops the clock and time freezes. Waring Hudsucker appears to Norville as an angel and tells him that the Blue Letter that was supposed to be delivered to Mussburger contains a legal document indicating that Hudsucker's shares would go to his immediate successor, which is now Norville. Moses fights and defeats Aloysius inside the tower, allowing Norville to fall safely to the ground. Norville and Amy reconcile. As 1959 progresses, it is Mussburger who is sent to the asylum while Norville develops a new invention ""for kids,"" a flying disc of some kind that will ultimately turn out to be a frisbee.suicide new york city corruption journalist inventor undercover toy plan boss investigation company industry party money board stocks 1950s hula hoop",False,tt0110074,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,14938149,0,0,-1.6777079275350648,-1.666470205521697,164783135.0,192640735.0,,,49262447.0,56092047.0,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-2846061.0,3.0,6153939.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-2846061.0,6153939.0,1.0,-2846061.0,6153939.0,1.0,,,,,,,82522250.33333333,90618250.33333333,3.0,-2846061.0,6153939.0,1.0,,,,-93000.0,7000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-2846061.0,6153939.0,1.0,,,,-4464879.0,5035121.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,-2009769.0,4490231.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,6153939.0,-2846061.0,0.375,1.0,95723774.27597362

Upon entering the alien craft, the crew finds hundreds of dead, shrivelled bat-like creatures and three naked humanoid bodies  in suspended animation within glass coffin-like containers. The crew recovers the three aliens and begins the return trip to Earth. During the return journey, mission control loses contact with the shuttle as it nears Earth and a rescue mission is launched to investigate. The rescuers discover that the Churchill has been severely damaged by fire, with its internal components destroyed, and the three containers bearing the aliens are all that remain intact. The aliens are taken to the European Space Research Centre in London where they are watched over by Dr. Leonard Bukovski  and Dr. Hans Fallada . Prior to an autopsy, the female alien  awakens and sucks the titular ""life force"" out of a guard. The female then escapes the research facility and proceeds to drain various other humans of their life force, also revealing an ability to shape-shift.{{cite news}} and seek out other humans in order to absorb their life force, thereby perpetuating the zombie virus. The absorbed life force consumed by the zombies is collected by the male vampires to deliver to the female vampire, who then transfers the accumulated energy to a waiting spaceship in Earth's orbit. Fallada manages to impale one of the male vampires with a sword made of leaded iron and surmises that the space vampire race is actually the origin of the human vampire myth. Carlsen then admits to Caine that, whilst on the shuttle, he felt compelled to open the female vampire's container and to share his life force with her. Carlsen realizes that his psychic connection is being used to lure him back to the alien so she can regain the life force shared with him earlier. She is later found lying upon a church's altar, transferring the energy from infected humans to her spaceship. Caine follows Carlsen into the church and is intercepted by the second male vampire, whom he dispatches using the leaded iron sword obtained from Fallada . Caine relocates Carlsen but the colonel manages to impale himself and the female alien simultaneously as a sacrifice for the benefit of Earth. However, the female vampire is only wounded and returns to her ship with Carlsen in tow, releasing a burst of energy that destroys the top of the church building.

Among the victors are the misogynistic and witty Benedick , erstwhile flame of Leonato's equally sharp-tongued and somewhat fierce niece, Beatrice , who is something of a misandrist, and Benedick's ""sworn brother"" Claudio , a young count. Claudio has been thinking fondly of Leonato's gentle and lovely daughter Hero  since before he went to war, and returns to find her as attractive as ever. Don Pedro, learning of his young friend's feelings, arranges the match at a party. Despite Don John's best efforts to foil it, the Prince's plan works out perfectly in the end. Needing something to pass the time until the wedding day, Don Pedro decides to arrange a similar fate for Beatrice and Benedick. Of course, both parties being such “professed tyrant[s]” to the opposite sex, this match will take a little more ingenuity. Leonato, Claudio and the Prince stage a loud conversation containing a fictitious account of how much Beatrice is in love with Benedick; all the while, knowing Benedick to be hiding well within earshot. Hero and her gentlewoman Ursula play the same trick upon Beatrice. Each of them believes the story they hear about the other. In the midst of all of this good-natured scheming, Don John and his men have been casting about for ways to stop the intended marriage between the man who “hath all the glory of [Don John's] overthrow” and the woman for whom one may suspect he has cherished some tender feeling. The night before the wedding, his servant Borachio arranges to meet with Hero's gentlewoman Margaret at Hero's chamber window. John shows his half-brother and Claudio the rendezvous and makes them believe that they are seeing Hero in the act of infidelity. Against the revelry of the evening, the constable Dogberry  appoints a watch to keep the peace. The three hapless watchmen happen to hear Borachio bragging to his colleague Conrade about how he and Don John had finally succeeded in wrecking the wedding plans. They make the arrest and send Dogberry in the morning to fetch Leonato for the examination, but the old gentleman is in too much of a hurry to try to decipher what the constable would say to him. Amidst the confusion, the villain has managed to escape to parts unknown before he can get his comeuppance. At the wedding, Claudio publicly disgraces his would-be bride and storms away along with all of the guests except for Ursula, the Friar, Leonato, Beatrice, her father Antonio, and Benedick. They all agree to the Friar's plan to publish the tale that Hero, upon the grief of Claudio's accusations, suddenly died. Beatrice and Benedick linger a moment, and wind up confessing their love to one another. In the wake of this declaration, Beatrice asks Benedick to do the one thing that will satisfy her outrage with what has just happened; she asks him to kill Claudio. He agrees, but it is with a heavy heart. Just after the challenge is issued, the story of Don John's deception comes to light, and the Prince and Claudio are sorely grieved for their grave mistake. Leonato forgives Claudio on the condition that he marry Hero's cousin on the next morning. Claudio agrees. When the bride is brought forth, she is revealed to be none other than Hero herself. They then profess their true and undying love for each other, as do Beatrice and Benedick when faced with written evidence  found in the pockets of each, Benedick's in the form of an endearingly poorly-written song. All are reconciled and Don John is discovered and promised punishment. The film ends with the whole of Leonato's household dancing in the courtyard, with the newlyweds at the center of them.william shakespeare bachelor new love rage and hate lover based on play or musical wedding intrigue",False,tt0107616,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,22551000,0,0,1.0500909090909092,-19.533412250327295,1176701.0,10176701.0,,,1176701.0,10176701.0,1176701.0,4,10176701.0,1.0,2713768.0,15.0,3713768.0,1.0,288174462.0,4.0,345674462.0,2.0,,0.0,,,20670720.0,5.0,34670720.0,1.0,9651769.0,4.0,18151769.0,2.0,233195.0,12.0,17733195.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1176701.0,10176701.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18126837.0,26126837.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1176701.0,10176701.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,71686769.16666667,53770102.5,5.5,1.5,41299258.6989175

He senses the presence of the Two Unicorns who safeguard The Power of Light, and bids his goblin servant, Blix, to find and destroy them. They are to bring him the horns, to create an eternal night of cold darkness, so he can roam the lands freely and ensure sunshine's warmth never returns to the realm of Light. Mischievous Princess Lili goes alone to the forest to meet her friend Jack, a ""forest child"" who is teaching her the languages of animals. He takes her to visit the unicorns when the hidden goblins attack with a poisoned blowpipe dart, hitting the stallion. The unicorns bolt, and Jack thinks it's because of Lili, but she makes light of his fears and sets him a challenge by throwing her ring into a pond, declaring she will marry whoever finds it. Jack dives in, and the surface freezes because the unicorn has been wounded, causing the world to turn to ice. Jack breaks through the ice but Lili has gone. She hides from the rampaging goblins, but when she hears them crowing that her beauty ""led the beasts to bay,"" she swears she will make it right, and goes after them. Jack and Lili embody the pure innocence of the male and female Unicorns of Light, suffering and overcoming alongside them. Jack cannot find Lili but meets Honeythorn Gump , Oona , Brown Tom and Screwball (two [[Dwarf . They believe Lili is to blame for the world turning to ice, but agree to search together for her. They find the fallen stallion and his mate instead, and Jack tells them that the alicorn  must be recovered for the world to return to normal. He is shocked when Gump tells him he must be their champion, and they leave Brown Tom to guard the unicorns while they get weapons for Jack. Lili finds the unicorns, but the goblins attack again, and she is captured along with the mare. When she awakens underground, Darkness is enchanted with her and begins to seduce her. He tells her that her sins make her a perfect match for him, and she is disgusted at first. He tries to impress her with promises of shared power, glory, and immortality. Furious with herself and scornful of Darkness' arrogance, Lili pretends to be mesmerized and accepting of his displays of power. She is swept into a Dance with Darkness, transforming physically and psychologically from innocent to enchanted and confused to coldly ambitious, as Darkness showers her with lavish jewels, luxurious apparel and tables heaped with treasure. Darkness tells her there will never be another dawn because he will kill the unicorn by sunset; sunlight would destroy him, he says. She agrees to marry him if she can kill the mare, and he is ecstatic. Jack and his friends have found them and overhear, giving Jack the key to his demise. From the ghoulish wedding banquet preparations they take giant metal platters to design a sunlight mirror relay, or heliotrope, of the beams of light before it sets, as Lili and Darkness prepare to sacrifice the mare. But Lili frees the unicorn instead, and Jack attacks Darkness while the others relay the light of the setting sun to kill him. Darkness shouts that he can never be destroyed, claiming ""I am a part of you all,"" just before he is blasted away by the light. They emerge from the underworld under a starlit sky, but Lili is still under a spell. Gump restores the horn to the stallion, and as the world returns to normal, Jack dives into the pond again. When he puts the ring on Lili's finger, she awakens and gives it back to him. Jack invites her to return and runs off into the sunrise as the others wave goodbye. The U.S. theatrical cut ends with Jack and Lili running off into the sunrise together. As Gump and his companions wave goodbye the shot fades to Darkness laughing one last time.witch monster winter underworld sword mythology magic hell princess romance snow sorcerer duel devil demon evil swashbuckler warrior treasure chest",False,tt0089469,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,15502112,1,0,-0.5804298149826295,0.8905496399261349,-5067854.0,9932146.0,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,111692319.0,10.0,112892319.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,27945162.8,43305162.8,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,49400372.0,68900372.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,-5067854.0,9932146.0,1.0,,,,42129618.25,49504618.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10814597.0,19314597.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,112892319.0,111692319.0,1.25,1.0,51342232.19105865

He meets Nizar, a member of the terrorist organization who is prepared to offer information in return for asylum in America. Despite his boss Ed Hoffman 's objections, Ferris agrees to shelter Nizar. Nizar is used as a pawn to draw out the rest of his cell, when he is captured Ferris is forced to shoot him to prevent him from exposing Ferris' identity. Furious at Hoffman's refusal to act on the information Nizar provided, Ferris and his associate Bassam  go to search a safehouse in Balad, Iraq, which Nizar had told them of. There, Ferris observes men burning records and attempts to bluff his way in, but is exposed. In the ensuing shootout and chase, Ferris and Bassam's vehicle is hit by an RPG. Ferris and some salvaged discs are rescued by helicopter but Bassam is killed in the explosion. Meanwhile, unknown terrorists plan to follow up off-screen bus bombings in Sheffield with more attacks in Manchester but blow themselves up when the police arrive at their house. Recovered from his injuries, Ferris is assigned to Jordan to continue searching for Al-Saleem, where he meets with Hani Salaam , head of the Jordanian General Intelligence Department. Hoffman finds an Al-Saleem safe house in Jordan and orders Ferris to surveil it. Simultaneously, Hoffman organizes another 'side operation' via a local agency operative named Skip  and that he is to conduct an operation without Ferris' knowledge. Skip employs the use of an agency asset, Ziyad Abishi who blows cover to a terrorist from the safe house, as he flees to inform his colleagues of their exposure, Ferris makes chase and kills him in such a place and manner that one might believe the death to be random. Salaam  corroborates the acceptance of killing by those whom remain at the safe house; and Ferris accuses Hoffman of running ""side operations"" which interfere and  undermine operational integrity of primary operation and tells Hoffman to stop. While going to the hospital to receive rabies shots for bites suffered during the pursuit and elimination of the terrorist, Ferris meets a nurse named Aisha , and he begins developing romantic feelings for her. The bombers strike again in an Amsterdam flower market, and kill at least 75 people. Having recognized one of the men living in the safe house as former small-time criminal Mustaffa Karami , Salaam takes Karami into the desert and coerces him into working for Jordanian intelligence, threatening to set him up as a collaborator if he does not co-operate. Hoffman asks Salaam to use Karami, but he refuses, believing a greater return will come later. Unknown to Ferris and Salaam, Hoffman tells Ferris' CIA subordinate  to follow Karami and kidnap him. Karami escapes and notifies the terrorists in the safe house that it is being watched, and they abandon it. Ferris's partner is caught and Salaam accuses Ferris of having had knowledge of the move on Karami, and blames Ferris's duplicity with him for the destruction of the safe house. He exiles Ferris from Jordan. Ferris returns to Hoffman in Washington, and they devise a new plan to find Al-Saleem. Suspecting he is motivated more by pride than ideology, they stage a fake terrorist attack and set up Omar Sadiki , an innocent Jordanian architect, as its instigator, hoping Al Saleem will come out of hiding and attempt to contact him. Al-Saleem sees TV news coverage of the attack and takes the bait. Salaam invites Ferris back to Jordan and shares his suspicions that Omar Sadiki is a terrorist, though Ferris feigns ignorance. Ferris later tries to save Sadiki from being kidnapped by Al-Saleem's henchmen but fails and sees his partner nearly killed in the subsequent car crash. Under interrogation, Sadiki denies any knowledge of the attack though he is later found beaten and killed. Ferris goes back to his apartment and finds out that Aisha has been kidnapped. He desperately asks Salaam for help, admitting he fabricated Omar Sadiki's terrorist cell and the attack. Salaam refuses to help because of Ferris earlier having lied to him. Ferris offers himself in exchange to Aisha's kidnappers, and is brought to the middle of the desert, with Hoffman watching everything via a surveillance drone unmanned aerial vehicle. Ferris is surrounded by a group of SUVs, which circle him to create an obscuring dust cloud before picking him up. The dust cloud Hoffman's view, so that he cannot determine which of the SUVs, now headed in different directions, is carrying Ferris. Ferris is taken across the border to Syria where he is to be interrogated by Al-Saleem. When Ferris asks Al-Saleem about Aisha, he is told that someone has lied to him and that he has been double-crossed. Ferris tells Al-Saleem that there is an infiltrator  in his organization who works for Ferris, and that, by association, Al-Saleem works for Ferris. Al-Saleem does not believe Ferris, beats him, turns on a video camera and orders his execution. Salaam and his agents arrive at the last moment, saving Ferris' life. Salaam visits Ferris in the hospital and reveals he had faked Aisha's abduction, and orchestrated Ferris's capture by Al-Saleem using Karami as a go-between. Having lost two fingers as well as the will to fight in this particular 'war', Ferris goes off the grid and goes to see Aisha again.terror spy journalist falsely accused based on novel or book dying and death jordan dubai intelligence agency beating terrorism danger secrecy",False,tt0758774,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,113280098,1,0,0.6182871142857143,-1.6278585820155915,153335459.4,241735459.4,116070171.0,176070171.0,218248108.29166666,276714774.9583333,126012887.5,10,163512887.5,2.0,260552732.0,8.0,362052732.0,2.0,20867861.4,12.0,59847861.4,5.0,,0.0,,,33787263.0,2.0,45667147.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,84286822.5,169286822.5,2.0,166465037.0,266465037.0,1.0,,,,174331265.2,256331265.2,5.0,166465037.0,266465037.0,1.0,119731811.4,207131811.4,5.0,110936088.44444445,180102755.1111111,9.0,428484858.28571427,531770572.5714286,7.0,16613561.8,54013561.8,10.0,,,,102175608.33333333,190175608.33333334,3.0,,,,123124391.57142857,190910105.85714287,7.0,127620950.85714285,200478093.7142857,7.0,70889332.33333333,127555999.0,3.0,-8224415.0,3275585.0,1.0,166465037.0,266465037.0,1.0,81643158.0,211643158.0,1.0,73601592.0,173601592.0,2.0,170934568.25,277184568.25,4.0,174868133.0,287368133.0,2.0,48419051.333333336,146752384.66666666,3.0,,,,,,,85548772.66666667,185882106.0,3.0,-3137195.0,1862805.0,1.0,,,157770157.1,110305185.975,4.0,2.75,95612307.5388973

Howard and Boleyn hope Anne will become the King's mistress and mother of his son, to the disgust of her mother, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire and Ormond . Anne eventually concurs to please her father and uncle. Anne's younger sister, Mary, marries William Carey, even though his family had asked for Anne's hand. While visiting the Boleyn estate, Henry is injured in a hunting accident, indirectly caused by Anne, and is nursed by Mary. While in her care, Henry becomes smitten with her and he invites her to court. With great reluctance, Mary and William agree, knowing what will be expected of her. Mary and Anne become ladies-in-waiting to Queen Catherine and Henry sends William away on an assignment. Separated from her husband, Mary finds herself falling in love with Henry. Rebellious Anne secretly marries the nobleman Henry Percy, who was engaged to Mary Talbot. Anne confides in her brother George, who is overjoyed and tells Mary. Fearing Anne will ruin her reputation by marrying without the king's consent, Mary alerts her father and uncle. They confront Anne, the marriage is annulled and she is exiled to France. Despite the scandal, the family's fortunes seem secure when Mary becomes pregnant. They receive a number of new grants and estates, so their debts are paid and Henry arranges for George to marry Jane Parker, but he despises her. When Mary nearly suffers a miscarriage, she is confined to bed until her child is born. Norfolk recalls Anne to England to keep Henry's attention from wandering to another rival. In her belief that Mary exiled her to increase her own status, Anne plans her revenge. Anne successfully campaigns to win Henry over. But she exacts this promise just after Mary gives birth to the much-anticipated son, Little Henry, making her victory hollow. Henry then has Mary sent to the country at Anne's request and shortly after her return, Mary is widowed. Anne encourages Henry to break from the Roman Catholic Church when the Pope refuses to annul his marriage to Queen Catherine, despite Henry's insistence that her marriage to his older brother was consummated. Henry succumbs to Anne's demands, declares himself Supreme Head of the Church of England, and gets Thomas Wolsey to annul his marriage to Catherine. Anne's schemes drive Henry to breaking point and in a fit of rage, he rapes her. Hurt and confused by the attack, a pregnant Anne must go through with the unhappy marriage to please her family and become the new Queen of England. Mary and Anne are reconciled and Mary stays with her sister at court. Despite the birth of a healthy daughter, Elizabeth, Henry angrily blames Anne for his failure to create a son. He begins courting Jane Seymour in secret, which doesn't help Anne's slowly crumbling psyche. After she suffers the miscarriage of a son, Anne begs George to commit incest with her to replace the child she lost, because if anyone found out about the miscarriage, she would be burned as a witch. George agrees, despite Mary's disapproval, knowing that it is Anne's only hope. He cannot go through with it, and they stop before anything happens. However, George's neglected wife Jane witnesses enough of their encounter to become suspicious. She reports what she has seen and both Anne and George are arrested. Despite the lack of evidence, the two are found guilty and sentenced to death for treason, adultery and incest. George is executed in front of a horrified Thomas. Distraught by news, Elizabeth Boleyn disowns her husband and brother, vowing never to forgive them for what their greed did to her children. Mary returns to court to plead for her siblings' lives. Believing that Henry will spare her sister, she leaves to see Anne right before the scheduled execution. The two sisters embrace and reconcile with one another and Anne asks Mary to take care of Elizabeth if anything should happen to her. Mary watches from the crowd as Anne makes her final speech, waiting for the execution to be cancelled as Henry promised. A letter from Henry is given to Mary, which reveals he has decided not to stop the execution and save Anne, and she is beheaded. The closing captions reveal that Thomas Boleyn died two years after the executions, disgraced and alone. Elizabeth Boleyn died a year after her husband while The Duke of Norfolk was later imprisoned in the Tower. The next three generations of his family – son, grandson and great-grandson – were all executed for treason. True to her word, Elizabeth Boleyn never saw or spoke to her husband and brother again. Henry's break from the Roman Catholic Church changed the face of England forever. Meanwhile, Mary married William Stafford and lived happily with him and their children away from the royal court for the rest of her life. Henry should not have been concerned about leaving England with a strong heir because, in fact, he had one: “an heir who would rule England for forty-five years and transform it into one of the most powerful nations in Europe. However, it was not the son he desired, but the strong red-haired girl Anne gave him: Elizabeth”.sibling relationship england queen kingdom henry viii palace intrigue",False,tt0467200,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,78269970,0,0,1.2362848571428569,-1.6278585820155915,108384128.0,123384128.0,38783881.17391305,61962142.04347826,15589417.285714285,39803703.0,86262272.0,5,152762272.0,2.0,33106920.0,7.0,42231920.0,4.0,201699751.5,7.0,335199751.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,88648190.33333333,16.0,99843023.66666667,6.0,15850460.5,2.0,70850460.5,2.0,99266061.0,1.0,129266061.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,188136728.25,232761728.25,4.0,2271246.4,17071246.4,5.0,3000000.0,10000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,36096230.25,53434422.5,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,39631329.0,128964662.33333333,3.0,1818479.0,7818479.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,138358914.7777778,87472275.8888889,4.75,2.8333333333333335,95612307.5388973

At South Station, Boston, Thomas Craven  picks up his daughter, Emma , who has returned home to visit. She vomits while getting into the car. At home, as Craven prepares a meal, Emma starts to nosebleed and vomits again, and becomes frantic, saying that she needs to see a doctor and tell him something. When they stop at the porch, as they hurriedly leave to find a hospital, a masked gunman yells ""Craven!"" and then fires simultaneous shotgun blasts at Emma before driving away. Blasted through the door, she dies in Craven's arms. At first, everyone believes that Craven, a homicide detective for the Boston Police Department, was the gunman's target, but when Craven finds Emma had a .45 pistol in her night stand, he starts to suspect that Emma was an intended target. At the police station, he checks the ownership of the pistol and finds that it belongs to her boyfriend David . David is living in fear of a nearby company called Northmoor, where Emma worked, and Craven makes a discovery: Emma found out that Northmoor, a research and development facility under contract to the U.S. government, was secretly manufacturing nuclear weapons using foreign material and foreign specifications. It was intended to be traced to foreign nations if they are used as dirty bombs. Following the failed break-in of the activists seen dead at the opening, Emma was poisoned with thallium through a bottle of organic milk. Burning her clothing in his backyard, Craven encounters Jedburgh , a British ""consultant"" tasked with preventing Craven from discovering Emma's information, or killing him. Jedburgh instead takes a liking to Craven, and leaves him to investigate. David is later killed. Throughout the film, Craven repeatedly imagines he hears and sees his daughter, even having short conversations and interactions with her . Craven also has several encounters with Northmoor agents, and he eventually discovers through one of Emma's friends, another activist who is nearly killed by another of Northmoor's agents, that Jack Bennett , head of Northmoor, ordered the murder of his daughter, as well as the activists Emma was working with to steal evidence of the illegal nuclear weapons. Northmoor personnel kill a hitman marked as a fall guy after he is set up for killing Emma. Craven confronts lawyer and Massachusetts U.S. Senator Jim Pine , contacted earlier by Emma, revealing that they know almost everything that happened. At night, Craven's fellow detective and friend, Bill , talks to Craven at his home while the Northmoor agents break into the house. Craven realizes that Bill set him up, and the agents taser and kidnap him, taking him to Northmoor. Craven, upon waking up handcuffed to a gurney, manages to quickly escape the facility and returns home. His health deteriorating rapidly from the poison, Craven arrives at Bennett's house and kills the agents, one of whom Craven realizes is the man who shot his daughter. After he orders him at gunpoint to scream the name ""Craven"", he executes his daughter's killer. Bennett shoots Craven, but Craven tackles Bennett and pulls out the radioactive milk. He forces it down Bennett's throat and collapses. A gagging Bennett frantically runs to his cabinet to get pills to counteract the radioactivity, but Craven drags himself over and shoots Bennett in the throat, killing him. Craven is hospitalized for the gunshot wounds and radiation poisoning. Jedburgh, who is revealed to be suffering from an unrelated terminal illness, meets the Senator  and the two political advisors who assigned Jedburgh to eliminate Craven. He listens to their suggestions as to how to play the Northmoor incident in a positive light. He tells them that he is done and then suggests an assassination attempt on the Senator should be the feature story, to drive Bennett's death out of the tabloids. They are happy to go along with the story until Jedburgh coldly tells the senator that he is on the wrong side of the equation. As the meeting ends, Jedburgh abruptly pulls out a gun and shoots both advisors, and then the senator dead, before a young Massachusetts State Police officer enters . Jedburgh points his gun at the officer and asks if the young man has a family and kids. The officer says yes; Jedburgh contemplates shooting the officer, and thus ultimately becoming like those who he sought to stop, lowers his gun to face his death as an honorable man. He is immediately shot dead by the officer. As Craven lies dying in the hospital, a young reporter for the local FOX TV station WFXT, who spoke to Craven a few nights earlier at his home, opens a letter from him with DVDs  revealing the conspiracy, with Craven's ""good luck"" wishes, ensuring Northmoor's end. As Craven dies, Emma, in spirit form, comforts him. The father and daughter are shown leaving the hospital together, walking down the corridor and toward a bright, white light.assassination senator cover-up murder based on tv series conspiracy theory violence police officer death of daughter homicide detective vigilantism activist",False,tt1226273,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,74901339,0,0,-0.06807169361818753,-2.2977368060284267,,,-3121109.0,31878891.0,10688881.333333334,24501450.041666668,81724013.0,26,116724013.0,2.0,30824968.333333332,9.0,72924968.33333333,3.0,7872882.8,6.0,37872882.8,5.0,,0.0,,,2928871.0,3.0,18928871.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,13804693.25,41679693.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,371619997.0,475619997.0,2.0,27784194.0,87784194.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,125895275.33333333,168695275.33333334,6.0,309243322.7,408229322.7,10.0,,,,423671319.0,546171319.0,2.0,282478293.0,450811626.3333333,3.0,62461628.0,162461628.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,235000000.0,435000000.0,1.0,,,,212955821.25,308955821.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,61612683.78333333,30837683.78333333,5.5,2.75,102557850.13709407

When her governess, Miss Taylor, gets married and goes to live with her new husband, Mr Weston, Emma proudly takes credit for having brought the couple together. Her father and their old family friend George Knightley dispute her claim and disapprove of her trying to make more matches, but she ignores their warnings and sets her mind on setting up Mr Elton, the minister who performed the Westons's marriage ceremony, with Harriet Smith, an unsophisticated young woman just entering society. As a close friendship develops between Emma and Harriet, it becomes clear that Harriet is being courted by Robert Martin, a farmer who has known Harriet since she was a girl. When Mr Martin proposes to Harriet, she is inclined to accept, but she has come to rely heavily on Emma's advice, and Emma persuades her to reject the proposal. Meanwhile, Mr Elton has been expressing a desire for Emma by taking an interest in a picture she drew of Harriet and by giving her a riddle for a book of riddles being compiled by Harriet. Emma misinterprets this as interest in Harriet, but when Mr Elton and Emma are alone, he fervently declares his love for Emma herself, and she finally realizes her mistake. She rejects his pleas, and he later marries another woman, who turns out to be a vain socialite who competes with Emma for status in the community. Over the next few months, various gatherings show who loves whom among Emma's friends: * Emma is briefly attracted to a charming, gallant young man named Frank Churchill, Mr Weston's son who comes to visit from London, but Emma soon decides to set him up with Harriet. * Frank Churchill is revealed to have a secret engagement with a shy, pretty woman named Jane Fairfax. * Harriet has no interest in Frank, preferring Mr Knightley, who was the only man who would dance with her at a party. * Mr Knightley danced with Harriet only out of politeness, and is starting to fall in love with Emma. The conclusion of the story begins when Emma ridicules a poor woman named Miss Bates during a picnic, after which Mr. Knightley angrily scolds Emma and leaves town for a while. She finds herself thinking about him while he's away, but doesn't realise she loves him until Harriet expresses interest in him. When Mr Knightley returns, he and Emma cross paths in a meadow and have a conversation that begins awkwardly but ends with him asking her to marry him and her gladly accepting. The news of their engagement upsets Harriet, who avoids Emma for a while, but returns a few weeks later, engaged to Mr Martin. The film ends with Emma and Mr Knightley's wedding.marriage proposal make a match",False,tt0118308,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,37831658,0,0,5.412145423728813,-1.2635471289974909,,,,,,,11551000.0,3,22551000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14852277.5,22102277.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22551000.0,11551000.0,0.375,1.0,56576255.24926193

He is about to be released but Clouseau , who is now Chief Inspector and has arrived to speak on Dreyfus's behalf, comes to visit, and his clumsiness and proneness to accidents drive Dreyfus insane again. Soon thereafter, Dreyfus escapes from the asylum, intent on killing Clouseau. His first attempt involves planting a bomb whilst Clouseau destructively duels with his manservant Cato , who is under orders, from Clouseau, to keep Clouseau alert by randomly attacking him. The bomb merely destroys Clouseau's apartment whilst Clouseau himself is unharmed, largely because Clouseau has been distracted by an inflatable costume and a telephone call by Dreyfus which was meant to keep him in place for the bombing. Cato, however, ends up in the hospital. Dreyfus sets his sights higher. Using his knowledge of the underworld, he enlists the help of an army of vicious criminals, kidnaps nuclear physicist Professor Hugo Fassbender  and the Professor's daughter Margo , forcing the professor to build a ""doomsday weapon"" in return for his daughter's freedom. As Hugo Fassbender cannot bear to hear his daughter undergoing Dreyfus's torture , he agrees. Clouseau travels to England to investigate Fassbender's disappearance, with typically chaotic results, as Scotland Yard Section Director Alec Drummond  and Superintendent Quinlan  painfully learn. However, Clouseau manages to set his sights on Jarvis, the cross-dressing butler of the Fassbenders, and while Jarvis is killed by the kidnappers, to whom he had become a dangerous witness, Clouseau follows a clue found on the crime scene to the Oktoberfest in Germany. Meanwhile Dreyfus broadcasts himself to the world to announce his ultimatum. Disintegrating the United Nations headquarters in New York City before the disbelieving eyes of the world, he blackmails the leaders of the world, including the President of the United States , into assassinating Clouseau. Forced to take Dreyfus's threat seriously, several nations send assassins to kill Clouseau at the Oktoberfest. Many of the nations, however, instruct their assassins to kill other assassins if necessary in order to ensure that their own country can kill Clouseau and thus win Dreyfus's favor and possibly get hold of the Doomsday Machine themselves. This, combined with Clouseau's typical bumbling fashion, enables Clouseau to evade each assassination attempt just as it is about to happen, so that the assassins all kill each other instead. In the end, only the operatives of Egypt and Russia remain alive. The Egyptian assassin , sneaking into Clouseau's hotel room, shoots a man he believes to be Clouseau . The Russian operative, Olga Bariosova , who has sneaked into Clouseau's room, seduces the Egyptian, similarly mistaking him for Clouseau. His passionate sexuality convinces her not to assassinate him; when the real Clouseau makes an appearance, he is surprised to discover a beautiful woman in his bed who confuses him further by declaring her undying passion for him, and by finding a dead man in his bath. A tattoo on the dead man, combined with Olga's dismissively revealed knowledge, reveals to Clouseau Dreyfus's location at a castle in Bavaria. He leaves immediately leaving a confused and frustrated Olga behind him. Dreyfus is elated at Clouseau's apparent demise, but his joy is soured by a bad case of toothache. Clouseau, who has arrived in the village near Dreyfus's castle but has been denied entry into the castle by a mischievous drawbridge, eventually infiltrates Dreyfus's castle hideout disguised as a dentist, intoxicates Dreyfus  with nitrous oxide, and pulls one of Dreyfus's healthy teeth. Realising the deception, Dreyfus orders Clouseau killed, but Clouseau escapes. Enraged, Dreyfus means to seek vengeance on the world by destroying England; as he prepares for this, Clouseau, who has been thrown into the castle's barnyard, is literally catapulted onto Dreyfus's doomsday machine. Clouseau's weight redirects the disintegrator so that the beam hits Dreyfus  and the castle. As Dreyfus's henchmen, Fassbender, and his daughter, and eventually Clouseau himself escape the dissolving castle, Dreyfus plays ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" on the castle's pipe organ, while gradually disintegrating. The castle then disappears entirely, taking Dreyfus with it. Returning to Paris, Clouseau is reunited with Olga, who has dismissed Cato for the evening and intends on completing her seduction of Clouseau. This is interrupted first by Clouseau's apparent inability to remove his clothes without a struggle, and then by Cato, who chooses this time to once more follow his orders and attack Clouseau and Olga. The consequent struggle ends when all three are hurled by a reclining bed into the Seine.

However, before the Rs. 20 million question, he is detained and interrogated by the police, who suspect him of cheating because of the impossibility of a simple ""slumdog"" with very little education knowing all the answers. Jamal recounts, through flashbacks, the incidents in his life which provided him with each answer. These flashbacks tell the story of Jamal, his brother Salim , and Latika . In each flashback Jamal has a point to remember one person, or song, or different things that lead to the right answer of one of the questions. The row of questions does not correspond chronologically to Jamal´s life, so the story switches between different periods  of Jamal. Some questions do not refer to points of his life , but by witness he comes to the right answer. The story of Jamal's life includes his managing, at age five, to obtain the autograph of Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan, which his brother then sells, followed immediately by the death of his mother during the Bombay Riots. As they flee the riot, Salim and Jamal meet Latika, another child from their slum. Salim is reluctant to take her in, but Jamal suggests that she could be the third musketeer, a character from the Alexandre Dumas novel , whose name they do not know. The three are found by Maman , a gangster who tricks and then trains street children into becoming beggars. When Jamal, Salim, and Latika learn Maman is blinding children in order to make them more effective as singing beggars, they flee by jumping onto a departing train. Latika catches up and takes Salim's hand, but Salim purposely lets go, and she is recaptured by the gangsters. Over the next few years, Salim and Jamal make a living travelling on top of trains, selling goods, picking pockets, working as dish washers, and pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal, where they steal people's shoes. At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika, discovering from one of the singing beggars that she has been raised by Maman to become a prostitute and that her virginity is expected to fetch a high price. The brothers rescue her, and Salim draws a gun and kills Maman. Salim then manages to get a job with Javed , Maman's rival crime lord. Arriving at their hotel room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him and Latika alone. When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him, and Jamal leaves after Latika persuades him to go away . Years later, while working as a tea server at an Indian call centre, Jamal searches the centre's database for Salim and Latika. He fails in finding Latika but succeeds in finding Salim, who is now a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's organisation, and they reunite. Salim is regretful for his past actions and only pleads for forgiveness when Jamal physically attacks him. Jamal then bluffs his way into Javed's residence and reunites with Latika. While Jamal professes his love for her, Latika asks him to forget about her. Jamal promises to wait for her every day at 5&nbsp;o'clock at the VT station. Latika attempts to rendezvous with him, but she is recaptured by Javed's men, led by Salim. Jamal loses contact with Latika when Javed moves to another house, outside of Mumbai. Knowing that Latika watches it regularly, Jamal attempts to make contact with her again by becoming a contestant on the show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? He makes it to the final question, despite the hostile attitude of the show's host, Prem Kumar , and becomes a wonder across India. Kumar feeds Jamal the incorrect response to the penultimate question, and when Jamal still gets it right, turns him into the police on suspicion of cheating. The story is now where the movie began. Back in the interrogation room, the police inspector  calls Jamal's explanation ""bizarrely plausible"", but thinks he is not a liar and allows him to return to the show. At Javed's safehouse, Latika watches the news coverage of Jamal's miraculous run on the show. Salim, in an effort to make amends for his past behaviour, quietly gives Latika his mobile phone and car keys, and asks her to forgive him and to go to Jamal. Latika, though initially reluctant out of fear of Javed, agrees and escapes. Salim fills a bathtub with cash and sits in it, waiting for the death he knows will come when Javed discovers what he has done. Jamal's final question is, by coincidence, the name of the third musketeer in The Three Musketeers, a fact he never learned. Jamal uses his Phone-A-Friend lifeline to call Salim's cell, as it is the only phone number he knows. Latika succeeds in answering the phone just in the nick of time, and, while she does not know the answer, tells Jamal that she is safe. Relieved, Jamal randomly picks Aramis, the right answer, and wins the grand prize. Simultaneously, Javed discovers that Salim has helped Latika escape after he hears Latika on the show. He and his men break down the bathroom door, and Salim kills Javed, before being gunned down himself at the hands of Javed's men. With his dying breath, Salim gasps that God is great. Later that night, Jamal and Latika meet at the railway station and kiss. The movie ends with a dance scene on the platform to ""Jai Ho"".slum indian lead cheating suspicion game show quiz show orphan duringcreditsstinger taj mahal mumbai",False,tt1010048,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,377910544,1,0,24.19403626666667,-1.6278585820155915,,,850306.8333333334,12533640.166666666,19385660.5,30360680.375,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,2928871.0,1.0,18928871.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,19237563.0,74237563.0,1.0,32820285.8,62620285.8,5.0,222500000.0,262500000.0,1.0,,,,91933032.0,122504460.57142857,7.0,44071410.25,68821410.25,4.0,,,,29175240.333333332,44008573.666666664,6.0,,,,,,,,,,30839010.666666668,46172344.0,3.0,-17982197.0,32017803.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2928871.0,18928871.0,1.0,,,,29574304.333333332,59574304.333333336,3.0,,,,21070009.4,29710009.4,5.0,,,,,,,,,18928871.0,2928871.0,0.125,1.0,95612307.5388973

Biko has been officially banned by the South African government and is not permitted to leave his defined banning area at King William's Town. Woods is formally against Biko's banning, but is still critical of his political views. Biko invites Woods to visit a black township to see the impoverished conditions and to witness the effect of the government imposed restrictions which make up the apartheid system. Woods begins to agree with Biko's desire for a South Africa where blacks have the same opportunities and freedoms as those enjoyed by the white population. As Woods comes to understand Biko's point of view, a friendship develops between them. After a political speech at a gathering outside his banning area, Biko is arrested and later beaten to death while in police custody. Woods works to expose the police's complicity in Biko's death. He meets with Jimmy Kruger , the South African Minister of Justice in his house at Pretoria, but his efforts to expose the truth lead to his own banning. Woods and his family are targeted in a campaign of harassment by the security police. He later decides to seek asylum in England to expose the corrupt and racist nature of the South African authorities. After a long trek, Woods is eventually able to escape to the country of Lesotho, disguised as a priest. His wife Wendy  and their family later join him, and are flown to Botswana with the aid of Bruce Haigh ([[John Hargreaves , a controversial Australian diplomat who uses his diplomatic immunity to help them.

Contrary to popular belief, the listing's dates in the graphic actually stopped before the film's release, as the Apartheid government stopped releasing the increasing transparently false ""official explanations"" for deaths in custody.journalist 1970s male friendship south africa apartheid",False,tt0092804,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,25899797,0,0,-0.11969989571732935,2.4643612765605467,16502539.166666666,24752539.166666668,,,,,3566593.0,6,9566593.0,1.0,18036000.0,5.0,30036000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42243944.5,64243944.5,2.0,,,,55737889.0,77737889.0,1.0,,,,55737889.0,77737889.0,1.0,,,,,,,50348095.0,66681428.333333336,3.0,,,,-2338243.0,3661757.0,1.0,,,,55737889.0,77737889.0,1.0,,,,6864443.5,21614443.5,2.0,,,,16144347.666666666,29811014.333333332,3.0,,,,42494707.0,55994707.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,19801296.5,10801296.5,1.375,1.0,65482750.456980206

Sebastian's family, the noble Marchmains, strongly disapprove of both proclivities. When Sebastian takes him home to visit his nanny, Charles is enthralled by the grandeur of the Marchmain family estate, known as Brideshead, and he is entranced by its residents, including the devout Catholic Lady Marchmain and her other children, Sebastian's elder brother Bridey and his younger sisters Julia and Cordelia. When Lord Marchmain invites Sebastian and Julia to visit him and his mistress Cara in Venice, Lady Marchmain encourages Charles to accompany them in the hope he can be a positive influence on her son. Increasingly interested in Julia, Charles surreptitiously kisses her in a dark alley, unaware Sebastian is watching from the opposite side of the canal. Jealous of his attention to his sibling, Sebastian ends their friendship. On their return to England, Lady Marchmain makes it clear Charles cannot marry her daughter since he professes to be an atheist. Sebastian's allowance is rescinded by his mother, who is concerned about his increasing alcoholism. During a visit to Brideshead, Ryder gives Sebastian money, which he uses to purchase alcohol. When he arrives drunk and improperly dressed at a ball celebrating Julia's engagement to Canadian Rex Mottram, Lady Marchmain blames Charles and tells him he no longer is welcome at Brideshead. Sebastian flees to Morocco where, at the request of the now terminally ill Lady Marchmain, Charles finds him hospitalised. His plan to bring him home is disrupted when the doctor warns him Sebastian is too ill to travel. Years later, Charles - now married and a successful painter - reunites with Julia on an ocean liner en route to England from New York. They realize they are still in love and decide to leave their respective spouses and live together in Italy. Charles returns to Brideshead and persuades Rex to step aside so he and Julia can be together. Rex agrees to the proposal in exchange for two of Charles' paintings, an arrangement that shocks and angers Julia, who feels like bartered goods. Without warning, a dying Lord Marchmain and Cara arrive at Brideshead so he can spend his final days in his former home. On his deathbed Lord Marchmain, hitherto an atheist, regains his faith and dies a reconciled Catholic. Deeply affected by her father's transformation, Julia decides she cannot relinquish her faith to marry Charles, and the two part. Several years later, during World War II, Charles - now a disillusioned army captain - finds himself once again at Brideshead, which has been requisitioned by the army for a military base. A corporal tells him Julia is serving in the reserves and her elder brother was killed during The Blitz. In the movie's final scene, Charles visits the family chapel, where he finds a single lit candle. He dips his hand in holy water and is about to snuff out the candle between his fingers, but he changes his mind and leaves the flame burning.venice, italy sibling relationship england based on novel or book parent child relationship new love morocco artist castle studies innocence loss alcoholism oxford best friend university catholicism nobility 1920s dominant mother",False,tt0412536,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,13204291,1,0,-0.5146591361853506,-1.6278585820155915,8930921.8,22510921.8,20811672.0,37311672.0,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,54490184.333333336,19.0,76545739.8888889,9.0,272441487.5,7.0,339816487.5,8.0,48920569.5,8.0,58170569.5,2.0,85072577.0,6.0,120072577.0,1.0,-15707086.0,4.0,8292914.0,1.0,,,,4158533.0,12666701.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,10380902.5,23630902.5,2.0,,,,51233080.75,87358080.75,8.0,9104367.0,27271033.666666668,6.0,5610215.5,10610215.5,2.0,41941557.5,70191557.5,2.0,36325376.0,59658709.333333336,3.0,20811672.0,37311672.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,31931658.0,37831658.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,103236014.66666667,126569348.0,3.0,,,,35722011.5,43722011.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,120579657.57777777,89043546.46666667,5.5,4.2,95612307.5388973

Three other people live with Larry and Judith. Their son Danny  owes twenty dollars for marijuana to an intimidating Hebrew school classmate, but the bill is hidden in a transistor radio since confiscated by his teacher. Daughter Sarah is always doing her hair. Larry's brother, Arthur , sleeps on the couch and spends his free time filling a notebook with ""a probability map of the universe."" Larry faces an impending vote on his application for tenure, and his department head lets slip that anonymous letters have urged the committee to deny him. Clive Park, a student worried about losing his scholarship, meets with Larry in his office to argue he should not fail the class. After he leaves, Larry finds an envelope stuffed with cash. When Larry attempts to return it, Clive's father comes to his house to threaten to sue either for defamation if Larry accuses Clive of bribery, or for keeping the money if he does not give him a passing grade. At the insistence of Judith and Sy, Larry and Arthur move into a nearby motel. Judith has emptied the couple's bank accounts, leaving Larry penniless, so he enlists the services of a sympathetic divorce attorney . Larry learns Arthur faces charges of solicitation and sodomy, despite his previous attendance at ""mixers."" To cope with his streak of unfortunate circumstances, Larry turns to his Jewish faith. The two rabbis he consults are either obtuse, oblivious, or obscure, and his synagogue's senior rabbi is never available. Larry's mental state reaches a breaking point when he and Sy are involved in seemingly simultaneous, but separate, car crashes. Larry is unharmed, but Sy is killed. At Judith's insistence, Larry pays for Sy's funeral. Larry is proud and moved by Danny's bar mitzvah, unaware of his son's distractions from nerves and marijuana. During the service, Judith apologizes to Larry for all the recent trouble and informs him that Sy liked him so much that he even wrote letters to the tenure committee. Danny meets with the senior rabbi in his office, where the old man – who has had Danny's transistor radio in his desk – quotes almost verbatim from the Jefferson Airplane song ""Somebody To Love"". He returns the radio and counsels Danny to ""be a good boy."" Larry's department head compliments him on Danny's bar mitzvah and hints that he will win tenure. Upon receiving the bill for Arthur's criminal lawyer, Larry decides to pass Clive, whereupon his doctor calls, asking to see him immediately about the results of a chest X-ray. At the same moment, Danny's teacher struggles to open the emergency shelter as a massive tornado bears down on the school.minnesota midlife crisis professor jew / jewish bar mitvah dark comedy telephone call child swearing school bus aftercreditsstinger jewish family 1960s transistor radio",False,tt1019452,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,31430334,0,0,3.4900477142857143,39.7198236153607,45868327.0,71868327.0,31012884.444444444,57846217.777777776,56511991.833333336,90178658.5,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,37253829.666666664,52587163.0,6.0,126720069.0,163720069.0,1.0,,,,54213004.666666664,81213004.66666667,6.0,28416019.777777776,57416019.777777776,9.0,38247004.5,60580337.833333336,6.0,45868327.0,71868327.0,1.0,73396132.0,96729465.33333333,3.0,63412963.333333336,87111630.0,9.0,126720069.0,163720069.0,1.0,,,,50908775.6,69708775.6,5.0,50125907.0,68042573.66666667,6.0,,,,,,,57067245.5,104567245.5,2.0,,,,,,,126720069.0,163720069.0,1.0,,,,86294198.0,117794198.0,2.0,,,,17209955.777777776,36876622.44444445,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,151278235.71911615

Clues point toward Manuel Romasanta , who confesses to the crimes, but claims that he is a victim of lycanthropy. A scientist, Professor Philips , argues that Romasanta suffers not from a supernatural curse but from a mental disorder. Based on a script by Alfredo Conde, according to the end credits the film is based on a true story, that of Manuel Blanco Romasanta, Spain’s first documented serial killer. Conde is a descendant of one of the doctors involved the original Werewolf of Allariz court case that took place in 1953/54 in Galicia, Spain.

Rookie police officer Dick Durkin  is assigned to partner Harley Stone , a burnt-out and highly cynical homicide detective who, according to his commanding officer, survives on ""Anxiety, coffee and chocolate"" after being unable to prevent the murder of his partner by a serial killer several years previously. Now however, the murders have begun again and Stone and Durkin are assigned the case. After investigating the scenes of several killings, they appear no closer to identifying the killer, with their only clues being that the murders seem to be linked to the lunar cycle, and that the killer has multiple recombinant DNA strands, having absorbed the DNA of seemingly anything he kills. Finally, after Stone's girlfriend Michelle  is kidnapped, the detectives track the killer deep into the flooded and disused London Underground system and discover the truth: The killer is not human, and actually some horrific and unknown homicidal, demonic form of life - Fast, savage, bloodthirsty and fixated upon killing Stone just as it previously killed his partner. In fact, as the movie progresses, each killing and ""appearance"" of the monster is an attempt to lure Stone closer and closer. After a tense battle in and around an abandoned Tube Train, Stone is able to pull the monster's heart from its chest and kill it. However, as the policemen leave the scene with Michelle in a rescue dinghy, bubbles of air are seen breaking the surface of the area of water over which the beast had Michelle suspended as bait.

This concerns Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, who don't believe her, and are worried she cannot help them on the farm, which is at risk of foreclosure after the tornado. The two decide to take her to see Doctor Worley, known for his revolutionary electric healing treatments. Before going, Dorothy, while looking hopefully for any eggs laid by her favorite chicken Billina , finds a key with the OZ glyph, which she believes her friends from Oz sent to her the previous night by shooting star. Aunt Em leaves Dorothy at Dr. Worley's laboratory under the strict care of Nurse Wilson. As she is taken to have treatment during the onset of a huge thunderstorm, the lab has a blackout, and Dorothy is saved by a mysterious blonde girl who reveals that some patients have been driven insane by Worley's treatment and are hidden in the basement. The two escape the building with Nurse Wilson in pursuit, and then fall into a river. The blonde girl vanishes underwater, but Dorothy survives by clambering on board a chicken coop. Upon awakening, Dorothy finds herself back in Oz with Billina, who can now talk, for company. The two discover the ruined Yellow Brick Road, which leads them to the Emerald City, now in ruins, missing its emeralds, and all of its citizens including the Tin Woodman and Cowardly Lion turned to stone. Pursued by Wheelers , Dorothy and Billina hide in a secret room using the key, and meet a clockwork mechanical man named Tik-Tok. Taking charge, Tik-Tok explains that King Scarecrow is missing and has been captured by the Nome King. When the three go to visit a head-exchanging witch named Mombi  for more information, they end up imprisoned. While imprisoned, Dorothy, Billina, and Tik-Tok meet Jack Pumpkinhead, a man made of tree limbs with a pumpkin for a head. Jack refers to Dorothy as his mother since she resembles his own creator and reveals he was brought to life via Mombi's Powder of Life. They formulate a plan to escape to the Nome King's mountain. Dorothy steals the Powder of Life and uses it to vivify The Gump, the head of a moose-like animal whose body is made from a sofa, palm fronds, and rope gathered from their surroundings. They escape and fly across the Deadly Desert with Mombi and the Wheelers pursuing underground. The Gump's body falls apart while airborne and the group lands on the Nome King's mountain. The Nome King brings Dorothy into his domain and argues that the Scarecrow stole the emeralds from his kingdom to build the Emerald City. Dorothy and Scarecrow reunite briefly, but the Nome King turns him into an ornament and hides him among his large collection. The Nome King offers Dorothy's group a chance to locate the Scarecrow, but three guesses wrong and they will be turned to ornaments as well. All meet this fate and with each one changed, the Nome King becomes increasingly human . When it is Tik-Tok's turn, he pretends that his gears have run down, and Dorothy is allowed in to wind him. Before she enters the ornament room, The Nome King reveals to her that he conquered the Emerald City courtesy of her discarded Ruby Slippers. He offers to use them to send her back home on the condition that she will lose all her memories of OZ, but she refuses and goes to find her friends. Tik-Tok lets Dorothy in on his plan—if he guesses incorrectly, she can see what ornament he will be transformed into, giving her a clue as to which one the Scarecrow is hidden as. But as he makes his last guess, there is a bright flash and Dorothy cannot find him. On her last guess, Dorothy manages to locate the Scarecrow, who was changed into a green ornament. With the Scarecrow back to normal, he and Dorothy begin restoring the others who are all green ornaments. Upon learning this, the enraged Nome King traps Mombi in a cage for her failure and then confronts Dorothy and company in a gigantic, monstrous form. Intent on killing each one of them, he has his minions block off any possible escape route. He then tries to eat them, but Billina  lays an egg in fright and it falls into the Nome King's mouth. The Nome King drops Jack and he, his minions, and his kingdom begin crumbling to pieces as eggs are poisonous to Nomes. As the palace crumbles and they seem to have no means of escaping, Dorothy finds the Ruby Slippers and wishes for the Emerald City to return to normal and for her and her friends to escape, which they do. At the Emerald City, during a victory celebration, Dorothy spots the girl who had helped her escape the hospital in Kansas named Princess Ozma, Jack's long-lost creator and the rightful ruler of Oz who had been enchanted into a mirror by Mombi. Taking her place on the throne, Dorothy hands over the Ruby Slippers. After Mombi is imprisoned, Ozma then invites Dorothy to visit Oz any time she likes before sending her home, promising that she will check in with Dorothy from time-to-time to make sure that she is all right. Ozma also promises that if Dorothy ever wishes to return to Oz, she will make it so. Dorothy says goodbye to her friends and disappears in a flash of bright, white light. Back in Kansas, Dorothy is located on a riverbank by her family. Aunt Em reveals that Worley's hospital was struck by lightning and burned down. Dr. Worley was killed in the fire after he had gone back in to rescue his machines. Nurse Wilson is carried away in a prison cart eerily similar to the one Mombi was trapped in. Upon returning to the farmhouse, Dorothy sees Billina and Ozma peering at her through her bedroom mirror. When Dorothy entreats Aunt Em to come to her room to see Ozma, Ozma silently instructs her to keep her and Oz a secret. Dorothy and Toto then run outside and play.sequel wizard of oz l. frank baum based on young adult novel",False,tt0089908,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,11137801,1,0,-1.2446082489712291,0.8905496399261349,,,,,,,,0,,,13483718.5,9.0,21483718.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24389000.0,26589000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,42321540.0,69571540.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,124000000.0,160000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,18128940.5,25628940.5,4.0,,,,,,,,,21483718.5,13483718.5,1.125,2.0,51342232.19105865

They meet up with Moony and Jay; Jay tells Alisa that Trevor doesn't want her or the baby, and that she should get out of Trevor's life. Alisa decides to return home alone as Becky wants to stay with the boys. In the meantime, Trevor has gone to meet up with his Uncle Curtis . He sees Katie's brother, Lenny  at Curtis's house, but they do not speak. Trevor tells Curtis that he wants to work for him, and is then issued with a revolver, which Trevor had previously made by drilling the barrel of a starting pistol on a pillar drill at school. Trevor is then taken downstairs to a tied up man, Andreas, who is being tortured for failing to stick to an agreement about payment. Andreas is earlier seen purchasing drugs from Curtis. Curtis orders Trevor to cut the man's face with a Stanley knife. Trevor carries out the order, but then flees from the house, throws the gun into the river and goes to find Alisa. Alisa is on her way home when she sees a classmate, who persuades her to come to a party with him to cheer her up. Trevor arrives at the party, finds Alisa, and confesses he loves her.

As he is leaving Sam picks up the bat and hits Trife, who falls to the ground, critically injured. Katie's older brother arrives, carrying a gun and asking for Sam. He is about to execute Sam but stops momentarily and asks for a reason why he shouldn't kill him. Trife uses his last breaths to shout ""because he isn't worth it"".

A Scottish woman begs soldiers retreating by helicopter to take her injured little girl with them, but the helicopter is already overloaded. One of the soldiers sacrifices his place for the girl who has suffered an eye injury from the firefight but is uninfected. The quarantine is deemed a success, with the remaining Scottish population and the virus apparently dying off. In the decades after, diplomatic relations between Great Britain and the rest of the world is destroyed because of genocidal quarantine, causing a depression and civil unrest. During a raid by the police, they find Reaper Virus victims in a ghetto in London. Prime Minister Hatcher and his right-hand-man Canaris share with domestic security chief Captain Nelson news of survivors in Scotland, and they believe a cure may exist. They order him to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses Major Eden Sinclair, the little girl now grown up, to lead the team. North of the wall, while searching for any survivors in a hospital, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a gang of Marauders. After losing numerous members of their group including both APCs, Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured and Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape the attack. Sinclair is interrogated and tortured by the gang's leader, Sol and Dr. Talbot is barbecued alive. During Talbot's immolation, Sinclair manages to escape with another prisoner, Cally, and kill Viper, Sol's lover. After meeting back up with Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling, they make their escape via a train, driven by Joshua, Cally's friend. They are surrounded by Kane's medieval soldiers, Joshua is killed, and the rest are taken prisoner. Kane informs Sinclair of the truth, there is no cure, just people immune and sentences her and her group to death. Sinclair defeats Kane's executioner Telamon, while the others escape from the prison. The remaining survivors retreat to an underground facility and find a Bentley in storage. Norton is killed by Kane's men, but the others drive back to the quarantine wall. After a long, high-speed road battle with Sol's Marauders, Sinclair is tracked down a government gunship and discovers Canaris' true plan. Cally and Sinclair go in the gunship, while Sinclair then chooses to stay behind instead of returning to London. Nelson flies into the quarantine zone to speak with her and she gives him a recording of the conversation. In the end Sinclair delivers Sol's head to the marauders and they cheer, while the recording is broadcast to the country.dystopia quarantine futuristic sword fight lethal virus",True,tt0483607,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,22211426,0,0,-0.3506561892964459,-1.6278585820155915,,,,,,,3927799.0,6,32427799.0,2.0,-3026786.5555555555,26.0,25417657.888888888,9.0,-19341112.0,10.0,19658888.0,2.0,22150183.0,6.0,82150183.0,1.0,-3000000.0,2.0,28000000.0,1.0,24389000.0,37.0,26589000.0,1.0,-13782101.0,11.0,18117899.0,3.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32078258.5,42078258.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-10644631.0,9355369.0,1.0,,,,-13396322.0,71603678.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42027970.0,48027970.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,73111837.0,88611837.0,1.0,,,,,,,203440412.5,308440412.5,2.0,,,33194489.555555556,1616711.7777777778,12.25,2.7142857142857144,95612307.5388973

He is in a dull relationship, and working for his former band mate Paul, played by Simon Pegg, writing and recording commercial jingles. Gary eventually discovers that he is having lucid dreams about a glamorous woman named Anna, played by Penélope Cruz, with whom he is deeply infatuated. He aims to learn more about lucid dreaming by buying books and even attending classes taught by an eccentric lucid-dreaming enthusiast, Mel . Gary eventually discovers that the girl he dreams about does, in fact, exist. Paul arranges for Gary to meet her, but this proves disappointing, as she fails to live up to the expectations that Gary has built up in his dreams of her. He eventually continues to dream about her, and even soundproofs his apartment, and makes other efforts to be able to sleep longer, so that he can remain with Anna for longer periods of time.

When they arrive at the beach, they attempt to enjoy a relaxing day by the lake, but they are harassed by a gang of teenage hooligans. Steve stubbornly decides that he would stay at their campsite rather than give in to the gang. They endure a night of loud noise and catcalls from the gang. By the morning, Jenny and Steve discover that their food has been infested with insects. Hungry, they return to the car and plan to drive to find someplace to eat, but their car gets a flat when they run over an empty bottle. Steve replaces the tire and they set off for the town. While in town, Steve sees the gang riding around on their bicycles. Jenny and Steve arrive at a diner for some breakfast. In the diner, Steve asks the waitress if she has seen the kids riding around on bikes. The waitress jokingly asks if they have been terrorizing them. Steve laughs and states they have only been ""hassling"" them, and continues by saying that he wanted to inform their parents they had punctured his tire. The waitress then becomes strangely defensive, saying 'Not my kids'! When Jenny and Steve leave the town, Steve catches sight of a group of bikes sprawled out on the front lawn of a house. He stops the car, but Jenny pleads for him to drive on. Steve is determined to meet with the children's' parents and determinedly gets out. Receiving no answer to his calls, Steve enters the house, but almost gets caught by the owner, the father of one of the teenagers, who returns. Steve manages narrowly to escape out of the window, and he and Jenny hastily head back to the lake. Once back, Steve goes snorkeling whilst Jenny sleeps on the beach, but when Steve returns they realize the beach bag, containing the car keys and Steve's phone and wallet, has gone missing. Hurriedly, they go to check on the car, and much to their dismay, see that it is gone. Making their way back to town on foot, they narrowly avoid being hit by the car as the gang drives it wildly through the woods, stopping only for Brett ([[Jack O'Connell , the leader, to smirk at the couple. Later, Steve and Jenny come across the gang in the woods. Steve, against Jenny's will, confronts them. He demands the car keys and his possessions back, but Brett denies any knowledge. Unfortunately for him, the phone goes off in his pocket, prompting a scuffle, during which one of the boys produces a knife. Steve manages to grab the knife, but in the confusion ends up fatally stabbing Brett's dog. Brett, evidently saddened by his dog's death, throws the car keys to the ground and tells them to leave. Steve and Jenny manage to find the car and start driving away, but get stuck on a steep slope. Meanwhile, Brett has decided he wants retribution after all, and the gang catch up with them and start throwing rocks at the car, breaking the windshield and smashing the headlights. Terrified, Steve and Jenny luckily manage to get the car moving again, but with the headlights not working, Steve ends up crashing the car. Finding himself trapped by a tree branch which has come through his window, he tells Jenny to run and to try to find help. Jenny escapes and finds somewhere to hide, where she spends the night. The next morning she cautiously returns to the car but finds Steve gone. Following a trail of blood, she comes across the gang in a small clearing, with Steve tied up with barbed wire. She watches in horror as the boys, goaded by Brett, take turns torturing Steve with their knives as Paige , the girl of the gang, is told to record the whole thing on her phone. Jenny, realizing they are about to kill him, uses the bluetooth on her GPS to connect with Steve's phone. Brett notices this, realizing she must be close, and orders the gang after her. Jenny flees, the gang close behind her on their bikes. This gives Steve the opportunity to free himself from the barbed wire, and he also sets off running. Jenny manages to evade the gang, and eventually finds Steve, injured and bleeding heavily. She helps him to a shed where she tries to treat some of his wounds. She finds a wedding ring in Steve's clothing and he tells her he had planned to propose. The gang turns up and enter the shed but they find nothing as Jenny managed to conceal both herself and Steve underneath the construction in the water. The group leaves, and Jenny pulls Steve out of the water. They decide she should go on alone, leaving Steve concealed under some leaves. Following the power lines, Jenny treads on a spike and hides for fear her screams have alerted the gang to her location. She comes across Adam, the little boy she and Steve had encountered earlier. She pleads to him for help, but he instead leads her straight to the gang, who knock her out. She awakens to find herself and a near-dead Steve about to be set alight by the gang. Pouring petrol over them, Brett forces Adam to light the fire with a match. Again Brett commands Paige to film the whole scene with her phone. The rest of the gang are noticeably disturbed at this point. The ropes binding Jenny burn through and she escapes. Brett, in his fury, sticks a tire on Adam and swills him in petrol and threatens to set light to him if she does not return. Jenny, though, is already too far away, and can only look on in horror as Adam is necklaced alive. Eventually she finds a trail map, which she removes to help her escape. Narrowly avoiding Brett and Ricky by hiding in a large bin, she arms herself with a shard of glass, but before she can go anywhere she encounters another of the gang; Cooper. Having evidently realized things have gone too far, Cooper seems as if he is about to offer her his help, but before he can do so, Jenny stabs him with the glass. Although the shock of what she has done immediately strikes her, she can do nothing but hold Cooper as he dies in her arms. Finding the body, Paige screams, bringing Brett running. Another member of the gang confronts him, and begins to call someone on his phone, prompting Brett to beat him savagely. Paige then runs off, terrified by Brett's seemingly uncontrollable brutality. Meanwhile, Jenny finally reaches the road. Managing to flag down a van, she gets in, telling the driver she has been attacked. Worried, the driver explains he is looking for his brother Ricky, who is also in the forest. The driver stops the van and gets out, leaving the keys in the ignition. Jenny, scared that she will be caught again, resolves to steal the van, and speeds off towards town, running over Paige as she does so. She makes it to town, only to crash into the front garden of a house. Making her way around the back of the house, she finds a party in progress, she pleads for help and collapses. Coming to, she finds herself inside the house, with a woman  comforting her. As she looks around and listens to the phone call the parents receive from their children, she comes to the realization that she is, in fact, in Brett's house and asks to be shown to the toilet. Brett's father at this point notices the van crashed on the lawn. Finding no escape, Jenny arms herself with a razor. As the commotion builds outside, the door is kicked in and she is confronted by Brett and his father, along with the other party-goers, some of them evidently the parents of the other gang members . Brett's father orders Brett to his room violently as he and another parent push Jenny back into the bathroom. Brett's father says ""Just put her in the shower."" As the film closes, Brett deletes the videos from Paige's phone and looks into his mirror as Jenny's screams ring from downstairs.beach husband wife relationship lake camping rottweiler sadism forest revenge survival fear violence couple gang violence teenage killer",False,tt1020530,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,4294373,0,0,1.1471864999999999,-1.6278585820155915,,,,,,,10727301.0,3,23727301.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,5796544.0,2.0,8176544.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,42482.0,48482.0,1.0,,,,,,,362910544.0,377910544.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,362910544.0,377910544.0,1.0,,,,48156037.333333336,76989370.66666667,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-7788574.0,22211426.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,-3495040.0,1504960.0,1.0,31383514.666666668,71883514.66666667,3.0,,,,,,15951922.5,8261922.5,0.625,1.0,95612307.5388973

As Sarah struggles to remember the final line of her monologue, the town clock chimes seven o' clock and Sarah remembers she has to babysit her brother Toby. She rushes home and has a confrontation with her impatient stepmother. Following her parents' departure Sarah realizes that her teddy bear, Lancelot, is missing from her room. She finds the toy in Toby's room and resentfully declares a wish that the goblins would take the baby away. Abruptly, Toby vanishes and a barn owl flies into the room, transforming into Jareth: King of the Goblins . Jareth tells Sarah that he will return her brother if she can solve his Labyrinth within thirteen hours. He transports Sarah and himself to the Labyrinth, then leaves Sarah to start her quest. At the entrance of the Labyrinth, Sarah meets Hoggle, a grumpy and obstinate dwarf who refuses to help her. She advances through the labyrinth alone and overcomes a series of obstacles during her journey, including a Knights and Knaves logic puzzle, before eventually trapping herself in an oubliette. Jareth sends Hoggle into the oubliette to free Sarah and misdirect her back to the beginning of the labyrinth. As they travel Sarah and Hoggle encounter a group of goblins tormenting a gentle beast named Ludo, whose roars frighten Hoggle and lead him to flee. Sarah saves Ludo and travels with him but the two become separated. A group of revelers with detachable limbs called the Fire Gang harass Sarah until Hoggle reappears to rescue her. Shortly afterward they pass through the Bog of Eternal Stench where they are reunited with Ludo and add another to their party: Sir Didymus, a chivalrous, fox-like knight who guards the bridge that leads away from the bog. Hoggle offers Sarah a peach that Jareth had ordered him to give her. Upon biting the peach, Sarah falls into a trance and finds herself in a dream-like ballroom where Jareth attempts to seduce her. The sound of a striking clock reminds Sarah that she needs to save her brother and she frees herself from the vision to resume her quest. She rejoins Ludo and Sir Didymus, and the three of them approach the Goblin City that surrounds Jareth's castle. Hoggle appears and disables a giant robot that guards the city gate. Sarah forgives Hoggle for his earlier betrayal and continues with all her friends through the city, successfully defeating the soldiers of the goblin army who have been sent to stop them. Upon reaching Jareth's throne room, Sarah decides to go forward alone. She finds Jareth and Toby in a vast, stair-filled room, (inspired by M. C. Escher's [[Relativity , and attempts unsuccessfully to find a path to reach her brother. She is interrupted by Jareth, who confronts her face-to-face and asks her to abandon her quest in order to stay with him forever. Sarah recites the complete monologue from the beginning of the film, concluding with the formerly elusive line, ""You have no power over me."" Jareth, acknowledging defeat, returns Sarah and Toby to their home. Sarah discovers she can see Hoggle and the rest of her friends in her bedroom mirror. Sarah tells her friends she needs them, summoning them into her room. The film closes as Sarah and the creatures celebrate her victory. Outside the bedroom window, a barn owl briefly watches the party before flying away.maze castle puppet surrealism puppetry labyrinth fantasy world goblin kidnapped child",False,tt0091369,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,12729917,0,0,-0.9638776906400882,2.3644495162840293,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-13862199.0,1.0,11137801.0,1.0,,,,24772219.0,37772219.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,76958173.5,103458173.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-3889987.0,14110013.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,4210435.333333333,18043768.666666668,3.0,,,,,,,,,11137801.0,-13862199.0,0.125,1.0,55214818.96773516

Maurice's friend describes the great-niece as a trouble maker and a nuisance, but Maurice discovers that Jessie warms up to him when he starts interacting with her. He takes her to the National Gallery in London, England to view his favourite painting, the Rokeby Venus, by the Spanish artist Diego Velázquez. Jessie had expressed interest in modelling  and Maurice arranges for Jessie to model nude for an art class. As a result of Jessie posing for the art class, and inspired by his favourite painting, Maurice decides to give Jessie the nickname ""Venus"". Maurice and Jessie develop a passive/aggressive relationship over the course of the film. Maurice is forward in terms of his attraction towards Jessie while Jessie occasionally indulges his whims to a limited extent, such as touching her hand and smelling her neck, but also retracts the indulgences when she feels that he has gone too far. The plot of the film revolves around the evolving friendship or relationship between the two characters. For Maurice, this appears to be the last attempt at something approaching a love life, as his prostate operation has left him impotent. For Jessie, it is less clear what she sees in Maurice. During the course of the film we see her do everything from exploiting him , taking care of him, flirting with him, and rejecting him sexually to engaging with him as a friend. During the course of the film we learn that she has been rejected by her mother and great-uncle for her promiscuous life style; it is implied that she is drawn to Maurice because he does not judge her as harshly as her family members have. The plot comes to a head when Jessie becomes involved with a boy. The two young lovers convince Maurice to take a walk so that they can have sex. Maurice initially obliges the request, but returns to kick them out of his flat. A scuffle ensues and Jessie knocks down Maurice, injuring him. Jessie leaves with the boy and apparently spends the night out partying with him at clubs, later returning to check on Maurice. When the paramedics arrive, Maurice claims he cannot remember who attacked him, much to Jessie's surprise. Then Maurice calls for ""Venus"" to take care of him. Jessie, remorseful, agrees to look after Maurice. Some time later, after Maurice has at least partly recovered, he takes Jessie to the seaside at Whitstable in Kent. As they sit down by the water Maurice says to Jessie ""Now, we can really talk"", and dies, leaning on her.beach bar husband wife relationship grandparent grandchild relationship art aging actor",False,tt0489327,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,7818479,0,0,0.3030798333333333,-3.847336948521819,73668187.63157895,99310584.36842105,,,,,94421476.25,44,156421476.25,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,2470701.5,14.0,14470701.5,2.0,-14685000.0,20.0,2315000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-43478272.5,16521727.5,2.0,321889678.0,363889678.0,1.0,93147947.0,121147947.0,1.0,,,,42027970.0,48027970.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,35479076.0,57479076.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,20500000.0,38000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,57735725.916666664,27402392.583333332,9.75,2.3333333333333335,92887866.92008553

Later, she writes a page of seemingly random numbers and adds it to her school's time capsule, set to be opened in 50 years. In 2009, Caleb Koestler is a student at the same school. When the time capsule is opened, Caleb is supposed to read and write about some of the capsule's contents. He's given the page of numbers written by Lucinda. His widowed father Jonathan , a professor of astrophysics at MIT, notices the numbers have a specific set of sequences referring to the times and locations of fatal disasters over the last 50 years, including 911012996 . The last three sets of digits are dated in the immediate future. In the following days, a car drives by the family home with two strangers. They give Caleb a small smooth stone. Caleb later dreams of one of the strange men, who points to the window showing the world on fire with burning animals running out from the forest.  Jonathan tracks down Lucinda's daughter Diana and granddaughter Abby. Though apprehensive and scared, Diana eventually decides to help Jonathan. She says that her mother used to hear voices and that the next date in the document, October 19, was the day Lucinda always said she would die. Searching Lucinda's mobile home, they find pictures of the disasters she predicted, a copy of Matthäus Merian's engraving of Ezekiel's ""chariot vision"", and a pile of small smooth stones near Lucinda's bed. The last number in the document appears to be ""33"" but they notice that it is really ""EE"" written backwards. They figure out that EE means ""Everyone Else"", representing a cataclysm that no one will escape. Outside, more alien strangers walk up to the children waiting in the car. John drives them away only to have Abby say that the ""whisper people"" want her and Caleb to go with them. The next day, John has a sudden revelation and rushes them to the MIT observatory, where he discovers that a massive solar flare will soon reach Earth, making it uninhabitable. Diana wants to hide in some caves. John reluctantly agrees at first, but Diana decides to take the children and heads for the caves without him. As Jonathan chases after them, he calls Diana and tries to persuade her against relying on the caves. He warns her that the solar flare will penetrate miles under ground. While Diana stops for gas, the aliens take the children. Diana chases them but is broadsided by a truck. John arrives at the accident just as Diana dies, finding the small stone in Diana's hand. He goes back to Lucinda's mobile home, finding the children and the aliens waiting in a dry river bed covered with the stones. A space ship descends from the sky. John is refused entry but allows his son to leave with the aliens. The ships departs with the children and a pair of rabbits, and a distant shot shows many similar vehicles leaving Earth. The next morning the skies are on fire from the solar flare. John fights his way through the chaotic streets of Boston, arriving at his estranged father's home. They embrace as the solar flare burns away the atmosphere and incinerates the surface of the Earth, destroying all life on the planet. Caleb and Abby are deposited by the aliens on an Earthlike planet. They are seen joyfully running through a beautiful mountain field towards a giant white tree.cataclysm code end of the world time capsule astrophysicist grieving widower lexington massachusetts westford massachusetts prediction researcher numbers news",False,tt0448011,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,155446362,1,0,2.10892724,39.7198236153607,13054844.0,34758644.0,,,,,5112895.0,8,62112895.0,1.0,15628121.5,2.0,48128121.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,192838775.33333334,307172108.6666667,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,273531464.0,383531464.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,55120508.25,10370508.25,1.25,1.5,151278235.71911615

One day, he unexpectedly loses his job because of his criminal records, and he turns to his ex-con brother which subsequently leads to a laboratory robbery of gold dust gone horribly wrong, and his brother killed. Ben, with his long record of robberies, is sentenced to death. He says goodbye to his wife and daughter and goes to the execution chamber. After the sentence, he wakes up from his lethal injection near a psychiatric hospital in a small Oregon town, where he is told that he has been given a second chance from God and to begin work as a groundskeeper at the local mental hospital to live on. As time goes on, and with a wife and daughter he left behind, he wonders whether he has truly cheated death or if he has become part of a far more sinister plan for him. He meets two patients, a schizophrenic named Robbie and a murderer named William. William is very unstable and attacks Ben several times. Ben notices a tattoo on William's forearm. While Ben is in his cabin, he encounters a dog. Ben takes the dog in and names him Dog . Meanwhile, a skin irritation starts to develop on Ben's own forearm. He also meets a psychiatrist named Julie with whom he starts developing a relationship. Ben wants to leave the town to go back to his wife and daughter, despite warnings from Avery, who Ben thinks is the Angel that gave him the second chance. Avery states that if Ben leaves town he will immediately die. Ben attempts to leave on a bus, despite seeing a demon but he gets off at the last stop before the town exit. The next day he sees in a newspaper that the bus crashed and everybody onboard the bus died. One night, William escapes confinement and commits suicide in front of Ben, saying that ""they can't follow him in heaven"". Ben starts looking through things he finds in his cabin as to the origins of William's tattoo. Similar to Robbie, he starts getting paranoid that he is being watched. One night he sees a demon and starts running through the woods. He falls and loses consciousness. When he awakens, Ezra  tells Ben that Ben is in fact a patient at the hospital. He states that Ben burned down his house by falling asleep while smoking, resulting in the deaths of his wife and daughter and driving Ben insane. Ben reacts violently but comes to accept that many of the things, including the dog, the cabin, Avery, and his relationship with Julie are just hallucinations. He manages to get back his permissions to be a groundskeeper at the hospital with Robbie. One day, he finds a frisbee in a tree which makes him suspicious because he got the frisbee stuck in a tree while playing with the seemingly hallucinated Dog. He visits the animal shelter in town and finds Dog there, who was picked up a week ago . He looks through Ezra's computer and looks at the patient files. He finds that both he and William had an implant in their forearm  that causes hallucinations. He removes his own implant and copies the harddrive to a flash drive. Ben goes to his cabin and finds that it is wired with a security camera. He then goes down to the basement and finds a door which he was afraid to enter before. He finds Avery at several monitors that display feeds from security cameras. He beats Avery up for making him think that he was crazy. As he is about to kill Avery with an axe he is stopped by Ezra who explains that he is running a project that is designed to change people who were on death row for the better. Ben is still angry and declares the program a failure, citing William as an example.

After a heated conversation at the kitchen table, Peter and David retrieve the unconscious Tracey from the car boot. As they try to get her upstairs Peter gets side tracked by her chest not realizing that she has woken up. She headbutts him several times and Peter screams with pain. David manages to get her off him and has to fix Peter's now bloody and broken nose after tying her to the bed frame. The pair hold her for ransom in a secluded country cottage. Things begin to go wrong when Arnie's dimwitted son and stepbrother of Tracey, Andrew ([[Steven O'Donnell  delivers the ransom. Instead of money, the bag is filled with napkins. David and Peter realize that not only have they been deceived, but Arnie knew about Andrew's involvement in the scheme all along. After Peter breaks David's phone by accidentally dropping it in water, David goes down to the village to use a telephone box to call in another ransom. While there, he happens across some sinister locals who, upon learning that he and his companions are staying at the Barnarby Cottage, warn him to keep his doors locked and not to wander. Disturbed, David returns to the cottage to find that Tracey &mdash; who has proven to be highly intelligent and resourceful, albeit foul-mouthed and somewhat psychopathic &mdash; has incapacitated Andrew and abducted Peter. Some distance away, Peter and Tracey arrive at an ominous looking farm. Upon entering the house, they soon discover it to be the home of an insane and hideously deformed serial-killer known only as the Farmer. After opening a trapdoor in the kitchen to reveal a secret staircase leading down into the cellar, Tracey is stabbed through the stomach by the Farmer. Terrified, Peter flees upstairs and jumps out of the bedroom window. Tracey survives her injury and calls out for Peter to help her escape too, all with the Farmer in pursuit. Peter manages to incapacitate the Farmer with a shovel, saving Tracey's life. Tracey then urges Peter to kill the madman before he regains consciousness, but he is reluctant. As the two of them argue, the Farmer comes to and quickly amputates the end of Peter's foot with the shovel. As he is about to kill Peter, Tracey begins mocking him, ordering him to hurry up and do it. Frustrated, the Farmer suddenly turns around and gruesomely decapitates her at mouth-level with the shovel. He then knocks out a hysterical Peter and hangs him by his jacket from a meat-hook in the shed. Meanwhile, Andrew and David, discover Andrew's hairdresser Steven , dying from being disemboweled, before setting off through the woods in search of Peter and Tracey, when they stumble across the dead body of one of Arnie's henchmen, who has had his throat slit. Soon after, they arrive at the farm, where they discover a shed full of severed heads. David and Andrew hurry outside, where the Farmer pins David to the ground with a pickaxe through his leg. He then chases Andrew into the nearby horse stables, where he viciously attacks him with a hunting knife before ripping his spine out. Peter comes to and manages to release himself from the hook and crawl across the ground to David. After making up for a lifetime of squabbling, they vow to fight on, and drag themselves back into the farmhouse in search of a phone. The Farmer soon reappears, tossing Andrew's severed head and spine through the window. David attempts to defend his brother, only to be suddenly impaled by The Farmer with the pickaxe. Outraged at seeing his brother murdered, Peter begins to throttle the Farmer to death by strangling him with a length of rope. The Farmer manages to toss Peter down into the cellar and slam the door shut. But Peter still has the end of the rope, and he continues tugging on it, eventually causing the Farmer to collapse on top of the trap door. With the weight of the body on top of the door, Peter is unable to escape. With nowhere else to go, he descends down into the cellar. He flicks on his cigarette lighter to reveal the Farmer's equally insane and hideous wife and daughters standing all around him. He mutters defeated ""You must be joking"" before they set upon him, the lighter goes out and Peter screams as they attack him. After the credits, Arnie and his right-hand men are seen arriving at the farm. As they step up to the front door, the Farmer suddenly rushes out at them with the pickaxe raised above his head. As he swings at them with it, the image freezes and the screen fades to black.countryside ransom hostage hostage drama cottage farmer deformed",False,tt0465430,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1504960,0,0,-2.322347437805656,-1.6278585820155915,,,-9575399.0,19924601.0,2735333.3333333335,16188666.666666666,29120010.0,2,178120010.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18395702.0,18564702.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,178120010.0,29120010.0,0.25,1.0,95612307.5388973

Fifteen years earlier, Barker had been falsely charged and banished by the corrupt Judge Turpin , who had lusted after his wife, Lucy . At Mrs. Nellie Lovett's  meat pie shop on Fleet Street, he learns that Lucy poisoned herself with arsenic after Turpin raped her. Todd's teenage daughter Johanna  is now Turpin's ward and, like her mother before her, is the object of Turpin's lust. Todd vows revenge, reopening his barber shop in the upstairs flat after Mrs. Lovett returns his old straight razors to him. While roaming London, Anthony spots Johanna in an upstairs room of a large house singing to her birds, and a beggar woman tells him her name. Anthony is instantly smitten with her, and Turpin invites him in, only for Turpin's associate Beadle Bamford  to throw him out. Though Bamford warns Anthony that he will be punished if he is seen there again, the sailor becomes convinced that he and Johanna are meant to be together. During a visit to the marketplace, Todd denounces a fraudulent hair tonic by faux-Italian barber Adolfo Pirelli , and humiliates him in a public shaving contest, winning £5 and gaining the attention of Beadle Bamford. Todd becomes impatient while waiting for Beadle Bamford to arrive at his shop; Mrs. Lovett consoles him when Pirelli and his boy assistant Tobias Ragg ([[Ed Sanders  arrive. Mrs. Lovett keeps Toby occupied downstairs, while in the parlor Pirelli reveals himself to be Todd's former assistant, Davy Collins, and threatens to reveal Todd's secret to Beadle Bamford unless Todd gives him half his earnings. Instead of giving Pirelli a payoff, Todd beats him with a boiling kettle. He then stuffs Pirelli in a trunk to hide him from Toby, later slitting his throat upon realizing that he is still alive. After receiving some advice from Beadle, Turpin, intending to propose to Johanna, pays a visit to Todd's parlor to groom himself. Todd shaves Turpin while preparing to slit his throat; before he can do so, however, they are interrupted by Anthony, who bursts in and reveals his plan to elope with Johanna before he realizes Turpin is there. Turpin leaves enraged, vowing never to return. His chance at revenge missed, Todd swears revenge on the entire world and vents his murderous rage upon his customers while waiting for another chance to kill Turpin. He is indiscriminate about his killings, believing that he is punishing the corrupt aristocracy for their exploitation of those below them, while saving the lower classes from their misery. Mrs. Lovett becomes his willing accomplice, suggesting they dispose of the bodies by baking them into pies to improve her business. Todd rigs his barber's chair with a pedal-operated mechanism, which deposits his victims through a trap door into Lovett's bakehouse. Meanwhile, Anthony begins to search for Johanna, who was sent by Turpin to Fogg's insane asylum upon discovering her plans to elope with Anthony. The barbering and pie-making business prospers, and Lovett takes in Toby. With both of the shops being such a success, Mrs. Lovett informs Todd of her plans to move to the seaside. Anthony finally discovers Johanna's whereabouts, and under advice from Todd, he poses as a wig-maker's apprentice, who are allowed into asylums to collect hair for wigs, thus providing him the access he needs to rescue Johanna. Todd comes up with a new plan to lure Turpin back, and has Toby deliver a letter to him telling him where Johanna will be brought when Anthony frees her. Toby has become wary of Todd and tells Mrs. Lovett, unaware of her role in the crimes: he promises to protect her, loving her as a surrogate mother. Beadle Bamford arrives at the barber shop, informing them that neighbors complain of the stink coming out of the chimney. He is murdered by Todd, and Mrs. Lovett informs him of Toby's suspicions. The pair search for Toby, whom Mrs. Lovett has locked in the basement bakehouse to keep him out of the way. Toby is nowhere to be found, having hidden in the sewers after seeing the Beadle's body drop into the room from the trap door above, as well as finding a toe in a pie. Meanwhile, Anthony frees Johanna and brings her to the shop in disguise, while locking an asylum staff-member in a cell, where it is implied the inmates kill him. In Todd's shop Johanna hides herself in a trunk in a corner of the room while Anthony finds a coach. The insane beggar woman who has been pestering Todd, Lovett and Anthony throughout the film makes her way into the shop seemingly searching for the Beadle. As Todd enters, she claims that she recognizes him. Just then, Turpin's voice is heard. Todd quickly slits the beggar woman's throat and deposits her body through the trap door. As Turpin enters, Todd explains to him that Johanna had repented, and offers a free shave. Todd reveals his true identity to Turpin and stabs him in the neck numerous times before finally slitting his throat and dropping him through the trap door. As Johanna peeks out of the trunk, Todd spots her and prepares to slit her throat as well, not recognizing her as his daughter. Upon hearing a scream from Lovett, he is distracted. He tells Johanna to ""forget my face"", and leaves her alive in his shop. Todd runs to the basement, where he discovers that the beggar woman was his wife Lucy, whom he had believed to be dead based on Lovett's account of the poisoning. Todd realizes that Lovett knew Lucy was alive, and she attempts to convince him that she misled him for his own good, confessing she loves him. Todd pretends to forgive her, waltzing maniacally with her around the bakehouse before hurling her into the open furnace and locking her in. He returns to Lucy and cradles her dead body in his arms. Having witnessed the death of the only mother he has ever had, a vengeful Toby emerges from the sewer, picks up the discarded razor and slits Todd's throat. The film ends with Toby walking away as Todd bleeds to death over his dead wife.confession asylum razor villain widow beggar blood splatter based on play or musical child in peril cane lust violence person on fire incest infatuation shaving social injustice oven beadle uxoricide seaman mother figure barber shop folk tale",False,tt0408236,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,152000000,1,0,2.04,-6.117028646878049,324968763.0,474968763.0,,,32754709.0,49254709.0,143264868.4,21,191464868.4,5.0,98533739.5,22.0,137942072.83333334,6.0,412075011.2,12.0,487575011.2,10.0,17750588.0,17.0,35822016.571428575,7.0,131236372.0,5.0,143736372.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,39558115.0,74558115.0,1.0,,,,-11063574.666666666,34603092.0,3.0,221871812.75,310621812.75,4.0,300439229.0,388772562.3333333,3.0,,,,119424408.41666667,157049408.41666666,12.0,,,,,,,,,,224752289.33333334,334752289.3333333,3.0,,,,,,,131479686.6,222479686.6,5.0,,,,,,,,,,27733316.0,90548316.0,2.0,,,,94013509.0,173013509.0,1.0,,,,-8224415.0,3275585.0,1.0,134032498.66666667,228532498.66666666,3.0,284683452.0,340058452.0,4.0,,,199308068.20095238,160572115.82,9.625,6.0,105980128.20199434

She and her chaperone, Miss Wiggin, visit the publishing house of the Warne brothers and they decide to publish her book. Beatrix is thrilled and returns home, not without taking a drive through the parks to celebrate first. However it is revealed that the Warne brothers think her book is ridiculous and will no doubt be a failure. The only reason they agreed to publish her story is because they promised their youngest brother, Norman, a project. When Norman Warne arrives, Beatrix makes decisions about her finished book, regarding size, colour and price. Norman admits he has never done anything like this before but has given her book a great deal of thought. Beatrix realises what the Warne brothers have done regarding her and Norman but they become determined to prove them wrong. Norman takes Beatrix to the printer, and she has her drawings reproduced and copies of her book sold. Thrilled, Beatrix and Norman visit the Warne family, where Beatrix meets the wheelchair-bound but lovely Mrs. Warne, and Norman's sister, Amelia, nicknamed ""Millie"". Millie has decided that she and Beatrix are going to be friends and is overjoyed that Beatrix is a spinster, as is Millie, who believes men to be nothing but bores. The family befriends Beatrix, yet Helen Potter, Beatrix's social-climbing mother, is unhappy about her daughter spending time in the company of tradesmen. When she returns home, Beatrix and Helen bicker about Beatrix's stubborn decision not to marry. Beatrix reminds her mother of the book she wrote, and her mother retorts she believes the venture will fail. However, the book sales are very successful and copies are displayed in many store windows. Even Beatrix's father, Rupert, buys a copy along with friends at the Reform Club. Encouraged by this success and her father's support, Beatrix invites Norman and Millie to her family's Christmas party, despite her mother's misgivings. At the party everyone enjoys themselves and Beatrix shows Norman a story she is writing especially for him, ""The Rabbits' Christmas Party"". She shows him a drawing from the story and shows him her studio where she writes and draws. Miss Wiggin falls asleep from too much brandy , and Norman plucks up the courage to propose to Beatrix. Mrs. Potter interrupts before Beatrix can reply, and they join the other guests in the drawing room. Beatrix confides in Millie about Norman proposing, and Millie encourages her to say yes. Beatrix then tells the guests of the stories she writes and they are delighted and amused. Mrs. Potter, however, can not see what all the fuss is about. As the guests leave, Beatrix whispers her agreement to marry Norman, who is overjoyed. Soon after, Rupert Potter invites Norman to his office and tells him his opinion of him. At the Potter household, Beatrix and her parents argue about her decision to marry Norman. Beatrix is adamant and will not be dissuaded. Mrs. Potter tells her no Potter can marry into trade, but Beatrix reminds her that her grandfathers were both tradesmen. When Mrs. Potter threatens to cut her daughter off, Beatrix reminds them of her brother, Bertram, who married a wine merchant's daughter and was not disowned. She states she can survive on her own with her novels. Mr. Potter attempts to reason with his daughter, but she tells him she wants to be loved and not simply marry someone because he can provide for her. Beatrix inquires with the bank about her royalty earnings, wondering if she would perhaps someday be able to buy a house in the country. She is amazed and delighted to learn that her book sales have made her wealthy enough to buy several estates and a house in town if she wishes. When she returns home her parents offer a proposition: that Beatrix keep her engagement to Norman a secret and vacation with them in the Lake District for the summer. If she still wishes to marry him at the end of the summer, they agree that they will not object to the marriage. Beatrix agrees to the proposition and is quite convinced that she will not change her mind, telling her parents to prepare for an October wedding. Norman and Beatrix kiss each other goodbye at the train station and write many letters during their time apart, until one day a letter arrives from his sister Millie, informing her that Norman is ill. Beatrix travels back to London only to find that Norman has died. Overcome with grief, Beatrix shuts herself up in her room. She turns to her drawing, but discovers that her characters disappear off the page. Millie comes to visit and comfort her, and Beatrix decides she must leave the house. Beatrix buys a farm in the country in the Lake District and moves there to resume her work. She hires a farmhand to run the farm and finds comfort in her surroundings. With the help of her solicitor, William Heelis, she outbids developers at auctions and buys many other farms and land in the area to preserve nature.

When her father angrily arrives, he tells her that he is sending her to a boarding school in England. Arriving at the school, called Abbey Mount School, Poppy meets the headmistress, Mrs. Kingsley , head girl, Harriet Bentley , and her 'big sister', Kate . She is miserable in her new life as she does not fit in and has no friends. After two weeks, Poppy sneaks out after lights-out and writes an email to Ruby, her best friend in Malibu, complaining about her new school and classmates. She sees one of her roommates, Drippy  walking through the hall, and follows her to the school's freezer, where Drippy is indulging her ice cream craving. Disgusted, Poppy walks back. As she is, however, there is a fire drill, and she sneaks out the window to avoid being caught in the halls without permission. She ends up in the bathroom of an unknown man, who she assumes is a teacher, and tells him her name and is directed on how to get out. During a fight that ensued with Harriet, she learns that the person was actually Freddie Kingsley , the headmistress's son, and Harriet becomes embarrassed and angry when Poppy exposes her crush on Freddie. After getting dirty water on her by Harriet's ""maid"" , Poppy and Kate become friends. Revealing that the girls' old cell phones were decoys meant to be confiscated, Kate lets Poppy use hers to call Ruby. When Ruby sees Poppy's message, she is disgusted at Poppy's appearance and it is revealed that Poppy's boyfriend, Roddy, has been cheating on her with Ruby. After Poppy reveals that her mother died several years ago, her roommates decide to help her get expelled. Together they carry out several pranks which gradually brings them closer together. When none of their plans work, they decide to seduce Freddie, who is strictly forbidden to fraternize with any of the girls. After dancing with Freddie at the school dance, Poppy trips and hits her head which leads Freddie to take the concussed Poppy outside for air where he attempts to kiss her, but is caught by Harriet's followers. Before she leaves, however, he asks her out on a date. The next day, after being scolded by Mrs. Kingsley for her behavior and drinking the previous night, Poppy discovers her talent for lacrosse, whips the school's team into shape, and gets them into the finals . On the date, Poppy finds herself falling for Freddie. They kiss before Poppy returns to school. In her room, Poppy finds her roommates reading an email supposedly sent by Poppy, stating that she was only pretending to be friends with them so they would help her get expelled. She then finds out that Freddie has been given a similar email and is thereafter ignored by her friends. With no one else to turn to, Poppy sneaks down to the cook's room and calls Ruby, who accidentally reveals how much she dislikes Poppy and that she is seeing Poppy's boyfriend. Feeling even more alone, Poppy starts playing with her lighter and accidentally sets a curtain on fire. Hearing footsteps, she quickly puts out the fire and runs off. When she has returned to her room and in bed she has a terrible dream that the school actually is on fire. Horrified, she looks out her window and is shocked to see a real fire she then, feeling responsible, wakes up the school. When they find that Drippy is missing, Poppy runs into the burning school to rescue her in the freezer . After the fire is put out, Freddie finds her lighter and gives it back to her, refusing to listen to what happened and assuming that Poppy was the one who lit the building on fire. While Poppy waits for the Honor Court to decide whether or not she would be expelled, Freddie finds her crying and becomes convinced that the fire was an accident. During the hearing, Poppy tells her story, and at the same time, her roommates find out that Poppy did not send the emails. Going to the court, they stand up for Poppy and Harriet accidentally confesses to restarting the fire after Poppy had put it out. The movie is left off at the lacrosse finals. Poppy's father comes to the game and is shocked by Poppy's dramatic change in appearance and how much she looks like her mother, who was also captain of the lacrosse team at Abbey Mount. Abbey Mount wins the lacrosse finals and Harriet is expelled. Some months later, Poppy and her friends  are in the process of relaxing in Malibu. Poppy ignores Ruby's phone calls, now fully aware that she was not the friend she thought she was. The film ends as they prepare to jump off the cliff that helped her find herself and make proper friends.diving england boarding school spoiled child girls' boarding school malibu lacrosse school love interest teenager laptop discipline intimidation school mate change of plan all girls school",False,tt1024255,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,21972336,0,0,0.0986168,-1.6278585820155915,76646849.5,115015897.11904761,68397117.0,108397117.0,93884496.875,118348996.875,,0,,,-16062130.0,2.0,23937870.0,1.0,,0.0,,,66867982.5,2.0,89367982.5,2.0,16208106.333333334,22.0,48708106.333333336,3.0,-13185434.0,3.0,2814566.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,250375911.0,348125911.0,4.0,,,,90941062.95,120634062.95,20.0,,,,-41696962.0,25303038.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,665701.4,13965701.4,5.0,,,,,,,,,,32567144.5,57567144.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,41207131.208333336,13457131.208333334,3.625,1.75,95612307.5388973

He is currently grooming her older brother, Howard , to take over the ranch and sends Katy away to an exclusive private school where she constantly feels like a misfit. Being a similar, independent spirit to Katy, Rob has a hard time understanding his daughter as she continually defies his authority to follow her own path. When she comes home for the summer, Katy is met with her father's disapproval because she did not finish a writing assignment at school, but is happily greeted by her mother, Nell , and Howard. As much as Katy wants to run the ranch, Howard does not, and instead longs to attend college. One day while out riding, Katy finds a wild mustang, and feels an instant connection with the horse. She sets off to tame the mare, which she names ""Flicka"", despite Rob's protests that he does not want a mustang near his horses. Later on, Flicka is captured during a roundup. Rob still does not want a wild horse running amongst the saddle horses and forbids Katy from going near Flicka. Determined to prove she can run the ranch just as well as Howard, Katy defies Rob and starts training the mare at night. Flicka slowly warms to Katy and the two developed a close bond. When Rob finds out, he sells Flicka to the rodeo, leaving Katy devastated. Both Nell and Howard are furious at Rob about making the decision without including them. Seeing his sister heartbroken over losing her beloved horse, Howard finally stands up to his father and says that he does not want the ranch. The family becomes even more divided when Rob refuses to return Flicka. Howard and Nell refuse to help Rob with the ranch, which he is now considering selling since Howard does not want it. Meanwhile, isolated in her room, Katy starts writing about Flicka to try and escape her pain. At the rodeo, Howard and Katy  enter the competition that Flicka is being used in, hoping to get the horse back. Not realizing who she is at first, the frightened mare runs from Katy until the girl calls her name. Rob, however, catches onto his daughter's plan and tries to intervene. Katy freezes at the sight of her father, but Howard boosts his sister onto the mare's back and lets the two escape. Riding Flicka, Katy becomes lost in the mountains, and allows Flicka, who knows the terrain, to make her way towards the ranch. Back at the rodeo, the family reconciles and begins searching for Katy as a fierce thunderstorm moves in. As they near the ranch, Katy and Flicka are attacked by a mountain lion. The mare bolts, throwing Katy to the ground and the cat goes to attack her. Flicka protects Katy, but is badly wounded. The girl binds the mare's wounds and refuses to leave her. Already cold and wet, Katy quickly develops a high fever. After hours of searching, Rob finds the two and brings a delirious Katy back to the house. As her fever spikes dangerously high, Katy calls for Flicka as Nell tends to her. Rob thinks Flicka is mortally wounded and believes she should be put down, though fellow ranchers disagree. Overhearing the argument, a dazed Katy stumbles into the room and gives her father permission to shoot the horse. Heartbroken by her words, Rob goes outside and begins to cry as he finally understands his daughter's feelings and her pain. Later, a gunshot is heard and Katy bursts into tears, thinking Flicka is dead. The next morning, Nell finds Rob walking back to the house, supporting the injured Flicka. She runs outside to help and finds out that the gunshot was him shooting at the mountain lion. Both are stunned that the mare is still alive and decide not to put her down. Katy's fever breaks and over the next couple of days, she begins to recover. As he watches over his daughter, Rob finds the story that Katy had been writing about Flicka and begins reading it, eventually typing the story and sending it to the school so that Katy can pass for the year. When Katy wakes from the fever, she and Rob reconcile and he takes her to see Flicka, whom Katy is shocked to see is alive. Rob also apologizes to Howard and gives his son his blessing. Thrilled, Howard begins preparing for college. As a family, they decide to not sell the ranch, making it both a working ranch and a refuge for wild mustangs.horse",False,tt0434215,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,21000000,1,0,0.4,-3.847336948521819,25178060.0,66178060.0,,,80656029.81818181,97084666.18181819,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2300000.0,19300000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,92887866.92008553

Despite the poor weather conditions the pigeons have nearly reached their destination. They are, however, suddenly ambushed and attacked by a German enemy falcon called General Von Talon; two of the pigeons are instantly killed, yet the third, Mercury is taken as a prisoner of war. Elsewhere a small wood pigeon named Valiant is watching an Allied forces propaganda film in his local bar  in West Nestington. Wing Commander Gutsy, a war hero flies into the bar, informing everyone that signups are scheduled the next day in Trafalgar Square, London. In General Von Talon's lair, Mercury resists interrogation by his captors. Valiant flies off to London, bidding his mother and Felix, the local barman, goodbye. In London, Valiant meets a filthy pigeon named Bugsy, who is wanted by two thugs. In order to escape the wrath of the thugs, he signs up with Valiant. The recruits, Valiant, Bugsy, Lofty, an intellectual red pigeon, and Toughwood and Tailfeather, two strong but dim-witted twin brothers, form Royal Homing Pigeon Service Squad F, and are sent to a recruit training facility. Under the command of Sergeant Monty, who declares that he will toughen them up for the RHPS, the training begins. Meanwhile, Von Talon and his henchmen, Cufflingk and Underlingk, try numerous attempts to discover the message's departure location. However Mercury refuses to tell, despite the tortures inflicted upon him, such as irritating him with yodelling music and injecting him with truth serum, before Mercury accidentally reveals the location: Saint-Pierre. Throughout the training, Valiant develops a crush on Victoria, the camp's nursing dove. Eventually, Gutsy arrives and tells the Sergeant that the recruits need to leave the next morning, despite their training being vastly incomplete. Bugsy, however, decides not to go on the ""highly dangerous"" mission and flees the camp that night. The next morning, Valiant and the others prepare to leave and start to board the plane headed for France, but not before Bugsy shows up at the last second. The journey becomes extremely perilous, as the plane is caught in the midst of dogfight. Their plane sustains heavy damage and the pigeons soon have to bail out, in boxes equipped with parachutes. The pigeons are dropped from the plane; however a technical malfunction causes Gutsy's box to fail to deploy. The plane goes down in an inferno of flames, presumably killing Gutsy in the resulting explosion. In France, the pigeons meet Charles de Girl and Rollo, two mice from the French Resistance, Mouse Division, the latter being an expert saboteur who lead them to Saint-Pierre, where they receive the message they have been ordered to deliver. They soon come under attack by Von Talon's henchmen, resulting in Bugsy and the message being captured. Von Talon takes the message from Bugsy and decides to cage him up and eat him later. Valiant and the troops follow Bugsy to the falcon's bunker, where they discover that Gutsy has survived the plane crash. Valiant takes advantage of his small size and sneaks into the bunker through the gun barrel, retrieves the message, and frees Bugsy and Mercury. Unfortunately, the falcons are alert and give chase. As Gutsy and the others fend off Von Talon's henchmen, Valiant flies to London to deliver the message, followed closely by Von Talon. After a climactic chase by the falcon, Valiant hides in the cottage where he lives, where he is attacked by Von Talon again. With the help of his mother and Felix, Valiant finally defeats the villain by getting a giant hook caught on his medals, leaving him to be beaten senseless by the water wheel. Valiant delivers the message, and upon receiving it, a change of plans is made: They land in Normandy. After receiving the Dickin Medal, Squad F returns to the local bar in West Nestington, where Valiant reunites and shares a kiss with Victoria.animal 3d",False,tt0361089,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,61746888,0,0,0.7641968000000001,-2.6760407675788414,-6621859.0,8378141.0,84648887.0,154648887.0,,,20136321.6,9,43616321.6,5.0,,0.0,,,51347215.5,30.0,64197215.5,2.0,55111755.11111111,13.0,80934592.66666667,9.0,192636035.0,10.0,227636035.0,2.0,94483512.42857143,34.0,141912083.85714287,7.0,20298211.85714286,39.0,36855354.71428572,7.0,,0.0,,,,,,7137505.666666667,28804172.333333332,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,99191933.88968255,72335508.58280423,16.875,5.333333333333333,109858494.28372188

He explains to her the ""rules"" of ride sharing, they share half the expenses and it's her responsibility to keep up a conversation while they drive. The conversation is very stilted between mismatched pair: the anti-social, loner chick and the square Catholic High School graduate driver who is majoring philosophy. Guy reveals they shared a class together. Girl says it was a huge class and she never noticed him. Guy asks about her glasses, ""Did you have Lasik surgery?"" Girl is surprised that he knows about her glasses since she only wears them in her dorm room. An awkward pause is filled with the guy changing the subject. As she paints her toenails, ignoring him, they drive alone the open highway. An on screen clock shows they have been on the road for a couple of hours. She asks him to keep an eye out for a gas station, saying she needs a bathroom break. At the filling station, she doesn't want to get out of the car because the polish on her nails hasn't yet dried. He offers to carry her into the station, which, despite her protests, he does. While the guy talks to the attendant, Darren Moore, the girl finds the bathroom, which is dirty and in poor repair. After doing her business, she washes her hands only to discover the blow dryer doesn't work. After wiping her hand on her pants, she finds she cannot open the bathroom door. It is apparently locked. She begins pounding on the door for help, and though she had walked past several people in the diner section of the filling station, no one comes to help her. Eventually, she frees herself . She finds the guy still chatting up the clerk behind the counter. She is furious that he didn't come to her aid. He assures her they didn't hear her cries for help, though she says she could hear them talking. As they leave the filling station, the guy verifies his directions with the clerk, as if he is lost and doesn't know where he is going. The girl calls him on it, but he assures her he is not lost. Soon after they resume their trip, he takes a side road listed as Route 606. The snow covered road is reduced to one lane and his older car slips and slides on the packed snow. Despite her protests that they immediately turn back to the freeway, he continues saying ""this is a shortcut and we will be back on the freeway in no time."" As night falls, an on-coming car approaches them at high speed in a game of chicken. They swerve to avoid it, colliding into a snow bank. A radio news report warns that an incoming storm will bring snow and temperatures down to 30 degrees below zero. As they fight the falling temperatures, they begin to see people outside of their car, from ghostly priests to other manifestations of lost souls. Before they understand that they are spirits, the girl tries to touch one. Her hand is burned. The spirit turns to show that he, too, is a victim of fire. Bit by bit, details come out of the guy's longing for her. How he had texted her the suggestion to use the Ride Share program and posted his number for her to find. How he took the scenic route in hopes of creating a romantic memory. It also comes out that the bag she left behind was a bag of food he had bought for their trip. They think help has arrived when a Pennsylvania Highway Patrol Officer, Martin Donovan, knocks on their window. Oddly, he doesn't seem to understand their predicament, choosing instead to believe they were parking. Taking the girl from the car, he tries to get her into the back of his car. When it becomes clear to her that he means her harm, she struggles to get away, but cannot. The guy appears behind the officer, welding a tire iron, and beats him across the head, rescuing her. The highway patrol officer was a spirit and the most menacing one of them all. The spirits turn out to be spectres remaining who were victims of the rogue cop who would lure his victims to this deserted stretch of road and kill them, including four monks who witnessed his crimes. They learn of it from an article in a newspaper they are using for insulation against a car window. As the night progresses, during occasional fitful naps, the crimes of the rogue cop are re-enacted with the girl as part of them. As the night progresses, it is revealed that the guy has sustained greater injuries from the accident than he had let on. In a desperate attempt to get help, the girl comes up with the idea of climbing a nearby telephone pole, tapping into the line with the phone from the guy's household belongings, and calling for help. While it is unclear if she is 100% successful , she does make her call and returns to the car to find her traveling companion has died. Defeat settles in as she tries to figure out what to do. For reasons that are not made clear, she pulls him from the car. Perhaps she is planning on dragging him to help, when a pair of headlights show up. It is a tow truck operator, Ned Bellamy, responding to her 911 call. He loads the body of her dead friend into the back of his cab and they begin driving to safety. The tow truck driver fills in the blanks about the story of how people have been dying along that particular stretch of road since the 50's when the rogue cop was killing them. But even after he was killed, the string of deaths continued, including people inexplicably freezing to death in the cars. It's clear this girl has narrowly escaped a very close call with death when the same car that chased her and her traveling companion off the narrow road in the first place shows up again, this time driving the tow truck driver off the road, too. After the tow truck rolls and crashes, the girl and its driver are shaken up, but still alive. The tow truck driver insists on seeing about the other driver. At the bottom of a ravine, he sees a burning wreck. It is clearly the burning wreckage from the 50's of the rogue cop car. As the tow driver shimmies down into the ravine, the girl chases him, yelling for him to stop. The rogue cop is pinned inside his upside down car which is on fire. The priests show up, but rather than pull him from the wreckage, they pull the microphone for his radio from his car, preventing him from calling for help. The car becomes engulfed in flames. The rogue cop crawls out of the burning wreckage, attacking the stunned tow truck driver. As the spirit of the cop touches the tow truck driver, he instantly freezes. The girl scrambles away, back into the damaged tow truck, attempting to start it and failing while the spirit cop reaches her and tries to attack her. That's when the spirit of her Ride Share driver appears, once more defeating the rogue cop's spirit. The girl climbs from the car, seeing the ghost of driver standing in the woods. He apologizes and says he would have explained everything to her if they had had more time. She accepts his good intentions and then follows him through the woods. They pass through the cabin where the priests/monks once lived  and various other signs of the carnage created through the years by the rogue cop until they eventually reach the service station where they had stopped hours ago for fuel and a bathroom break.terror winter paranoia cold supernatural snow student crash",False,tt0486051,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,285000,0,0,-20.05263157894737,-6.117028646878049,14140044.666666666,46473378.0,,,,,3027375.0,2,4727375.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-13793872.0,8.0,206128.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20811672.0,37311672.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-64831034.0,35168966.0,1.0,40103895.0,57103895.0,1.0,101265204.0,179265204.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,2466751.5,-5383248.5,2.5,1.0,105980128.20199434

At the same time, the manager of the auction, Leroux , and the lead auctioneer  confront Morritz about the expenses he has incurred and ask him the purpose of his inquiries. Morritz gives in and lets them know that the violin in question is indeed the Red Violin. Ruselsky is furious at this discovery as he believes that the violin should have been his. Using his own funds, Morritz has Williams buy the copy from London, and it arrives in time for the auction, Williams authenticating that it is indeed the closest copy to the real thing. With this, Morritz heads to Duval's, passing by the Pope foundation member in the process . He sees Ruselsky and they exchange glances, Ruselsky still furious at Morritz's deception. As the auction for the previous item winds down, Morritz, with Williams acting as a distraction, switches the Red Violin for its copy, accidentally dropping the auction tag in its storage area. As the copy is being sent to be bid on, Leroux notices that the tag is missing and is about to call security when Williams finds the tag. As the monks in Austria, the Pope Foundation member, Ming, and Mr. Ruselsky bid on the copy, Morritz rushes out, nearly getting run down by a car in the process. Ruselsky eventually beats out the other three bidding competitors for the copy. On his way back to the airport, Morritz calls his wife at home in New York City and asks to speak to his daughter telling her he has a special present for her upon his return.auction violin",False,tt0120802,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,9495408,0,0,-0.8956531409708777,-2.5293608277783246,,,52572625.63636363,56010125.81818182,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,60772021.118274406

The documentary reviews both the footage and media available to the public at the time of the missions, as well as NASA films and materials which had not been opened in over 30 years. All of this has been sourced and remastered in HD by the stock footage company Footagevault. Augmenting the archival audio and video are contemporary interviews with some surviving Apollo era astronauts, including Al Bean, Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin, John Young, David Scott, Charlie Duke, Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt. The former astronauts have the only speaking roles in the movie, although occasional supplementary information is presented on screen with text and archival television footage presents the words of journalists such as Jules Bergman and Walter Cronkite. Neil Armstrong, the first person to set foot on the Moon, declined to participate, the only surviving moon walker at the time to do so. The documentary shares its name with a book by space historians Colin Burgess and Francis French, and both include many original interviews with Apollo lunar astronauts. The documentary offers a view of the Apollo program that is complementary to the book and is neither a source nor a tie-in.nasa space mission rocket moon landing space astronaut apollo program",False,tt0925248,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2175587,0,0,0.0877935,-6.117028646878049,,,,,985250.8,14605250.8,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,105980128.20199434

This turns out to be more of a curse, making Ella do anything she is told to do, no matter how terrible or physically impossible. Some years later, Ella's mother dies after instructing Ella to tell no one of the curse, not even her father. Eventually Ella's father  , in need of money, remarries a wealthy socialite. His greedy new wife, Dame Olga , and her two spoiled daughters Hattie and Olive  treat Ella poorly. They eventually realize Ella's obedience to commands, and begin making her life miserable. Ella, now a beautiful young woman, happens to meet Prince Charmont , the young, attractive, and very popular heir to the kingdom; they began to like each other, but Hattie and Olive decide to pursue ""Char"" themselves. Ella cannot bear to live under the obedience spell and Hattie's jealousy a moment longer, so she resolves to find Lucinda, the only one who can remove the spell. Mandy , the household fairy and the only other person who knows of the curse, introduces her boyfriend to Ella; he is in the form of a book but can help Ella by showing things such as pictures of people in their current surroundings. During her journey, Ella encounters an elf named Slannen , who wants to be a lawyer instead of an entertainer as the kingdom's laws now require. Slannen joins Ella on her quest, but they are captured by a group of ogres, who prepare to cook and eat them. They are rescued by Prince Charmont. He then accompanies her to a wedding in the land of giants, where Ella hopes to find Lucinda. As they make their way there, the prince and Ella begin to fall in love. They pass a plantation where giants are working as slaves, and Ella tries to open Char's eyes to the cruelty of the new laws oppressing elves and giants. There, Ella is forced to perform a rendition of Queen's ""Somebody to Love"", performed by Freddie Mercury. Char then suggests that Ella should come with him to his palace to visit the Hall of Records and track down Lucinda faster. At the palace, Charmont's uncle, Sir Edgar , has Ella's ""gift"" called to his attention by his talking snake, Heston, voiced by , who has been spying on the prince. When Edgar offers them Char's hand in marriage, Ella's stepsisters explain that she does everything she is told. Edgar knows that Prince Charmont intends to propose marriage to Ella, and he orders her to stab him to death and not to tell anyone of the plan. Sir Edgar also reveals that he murdered Prince Charmont's father. To prevent the murder of Char, Ella asks Slannen to tie her to a tree outside the city and to find the giants so they can help. Lucinda now appears before Ella, who asks her to undo the ""gift"" of obedience. Offended by the request, Lucinda refuses, saying that if Ella no longer wants the spell, she must remove it herself. She unties Ella from the tree and gives her a fancy dress and tells her to attend the ball. When Ella gets to the ball, Charmont almost immediately takes her to the Hall of Mirrors and asks her to marry him. Ella is about to stab him with the dagger Edgar provided, when she realizes how to free herself from the curse: looking into a mirror, she orders herself to no longer be obedient. This saves Prince Charmont from his uncle's treachery. But Edgar is watching the entire scene behind a two-way mirror, and before Ella can explain to Char why she tried to kill him, he orders the guards in, to lock her up and have her executed in a few days. Meanwhile, Slannen gets the giants, and the ogres come to help as well. They sneak into the castle just before the coronation. They rescue Ella and find out that Sir Edgar is poisoning the crown that is to be put on Char's head in the ceremony. When the crown is just inches above his head, Ella barges in along with Slannen and the ogres and screams, ""Drop that crown!"" Edgar and Heston call for knights and the ninja-like Red Guards, and they all battle in the hall against Prince Char, Ella, the ogres, the giants, and Slannen. During the fight, Ella has time to explain to Char everything that has happened. When Sir Edgar's forces lose the battle, Heston tries to bite Char, but is stopped by Ella and trampled by members of Char's fan club. This shows that Ella was telling the truth, and Edgar admits everything to the assembled crowd, saying it was justified because he is the only one fit to wear the crown. Then, carried away by his own rhetoric, he puts it dramatically on his own head, and promptly collapses from the poison, although he survives.

Backstage, city official ""The Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson"" reinforces the city's commitment to reason  by ordering the execution of a soldier ([[Sting  who had just accomplished a near-superhuman feat of bravery, claiming that his bravery is demoralizing to other soldiers. Not far into the play, an elderly man claiming to be the real Baron interrupts the show, protesting its many inaccuracies. Over the complaints of the audience, the theatre company and Jackson, the ""real"" Baron gains the house's attention and narrates through flashback an account of one of his adventures, of a life-or-death wager with the Grand Turk, where the younger Baron's life is saved only by his amazing luck plus the assistance of his remarkable associates: Berthold, the world's fastest runner; Adolphus, a rifleman with superhuman eyesight; Gustavus, who possesses extraordinary hearing, and sufficient lung power to knock down an army by exhaling; and the fantastically strong Albrecht. When gunfire disrupts the elderly Baron's story, the importance of saving the city eclipses the show. The Baron wanders backstage intending to die, until the exuberantly enthusiastic questioning of Sally Salt, the young daughter of the theater company's leader, persuades him to remain living. Insisting that he alone can save the city, the Baron escapes the city's walls in a hot air balloon constructed of women's underwear, accompanied by Sally as a stowaway. The balloon expedition proceeds to the Moon, where the Baron, rejuvenated by the escape, finds his old associate Berthold, but angers the King of the Moon, who resents the Baron for his romantic past with the Queen of the Moon. A bungled escape from the Moon brings the trio back to  the Earth, where the Roman God Vulcan hosts his guests with courtesy and Albrecht is found. The Baron and Vulcan's wife, the Goddess Venus, attempt a romantic interlude by waltzing in air, but this cuts short the hospitality and Vulcan expels the foursome from his kingdom into the South Seas. Swallowed by an enormous sea creature, the travelers locate Gustavus, Adolphus, and the Baron's trusty horse Bucephalus. The Baron  struggles with the conflicting goals of heroism and a peaceful death, before deciding to escape by blowing ""a modicum of snuff"" out into the sea creature's cavernous interior, which causes the sea creature to ""sneeze"" the heroes out through its whale-like blowhole. Back ashore, the Turkish army is located but the Baron's associates are now too elderly and tired to fight the Turk as in the old days. The Baron lectures them firmly but to no avail, and he storms off intending to surrender to the Turk and to Jackson; his cohorts rally to save both the Baron and the city. During the city's celebratory parade, the Baron is shot dead by Jackson. An emotional public funeral takes place, but the denouement reveals that this is merely the final scene of yet another story the Baron is telling to the same theater-goers who were attending the theater in the beginning of the film. The Baron calls the foregoing ""only one of the many occasions on which I met my death"" and closes his tale by saying ""everyone who had a talent for it lived happily ever after."" An ambiguous finale reveals that the city has indeed been saved, even though the events of the battle apparently occurred in a story rather than the film's reality. The Baron rides off on Bucephalus. As the Baron and Bucephalus are bathed in the light of the sun parting through the clouds, they apparently disappear, and the credits roll over a triumphant blast of music.moon monster surreal hot air balloon war satire baron cult film story telling european roman mythology",False,tt0096764,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,8083123,0,0,-4.768809901816415,1.4934829882721732,,,,,54993712.0,62493712.0,,0,,,6860354.333333333,17.0,8360354.333333333,3.0,,0.0,,,28327201.0,20.0,35827201.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,37365581.0,7.0,42365581.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12308891.666666666,19108891.666666668,3.0,-4966603.0,8033397.0,1.0,9110374.666666666,20110374.666666668,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5488630.5,14988630.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28851045.444444444,24184378.777777776,5.5,2.0,47137400.206980206

At the next performance, after Helena and her mother have a heated argument, Helena's mother collapses and is taken to the hospital. Ten days later, while Helena is staying with her grandmother, she finds that the doctors determine that Helena's mother requires an operation, and Helena can only blame herself for the situation. That night, she wakes up in a dream-like state and leaves her building to find three performers outside. As they try to perform for Helena, a shadow encroaches on the area and two of the performers are consumed by it. The third performer, Valentine , a juggler, helps to quickly direct Helena to safety through the use of magical flying books. She learns they are in the City of Light which is slowly being consumed by shadows, causing its widely-varied citizens to flee. Soon Helena is mistaken for the Princess. She and Valentine are taken to the Prime Minister . He explains that the Princess from the Land of Shadow stole a charm from the City of Light, leaving their White Queen  in a state of unnatural sleep and the City vulnerable to the Shadows. Helena notes the resemblance of the Queen and Minister to her mother and father, and offers to help recover the charm along with Valentine. They are unaware their actions are being watched by the Queen of Shadows  who has mistaken Helena as the Princess of the Land of Shadows. The two attempt to stay ahead of the shadows as they follow clues to the charm, learning that it is called ""MirrorMask"". Helena discovers that by looking through the windows of the buildings, she can see into her apartment room through the windows on drawings she created on one wall of her room, and discovers that a doppelganger of herself is behaving radically different from her; the doppelganger soon becomes aware of her presence in the drawings and begins to destroy them, causing parts of the fantasy world to collapse. Soon, Valentine betrays Helena, allowing the Queen to capture her in exchange for a large reward of jewels. The Queen warps Helena's mind to believe she is the Princess. Valentine eventually has a change of heart and returns to the Queen's palace, and helps Helena to break the Queen's spell on her. The two search the Princess' room, and Helena discovers the MirrorMask hidden in the Princess' mirror; the two flee the castle with the charm. As they escape to Valentine's flying tower, Helena comes to realizes that her doppelganger in the real world is the Princess, who had used the MirrorMask to step through the windows in Helena's drawings to come into the real world. The Princess destroys the rest of the drawings in Helena's room, preventing Helena from returning, and Helena and Valentine disappear in the collapsed world. The Princess takes the drawings to the building's roof to disperse the shreds into the wind, but discovers one more drawing Helena had made on the back of the roof door. Helena successfully returns to the real world and banishes the Princess to her realm. At the same time, the White Queen finally awakens and the two Cities are restored to its natural balance. Helena returns to her apartment to learn that her mother's operation was successful; Helena returns to happily help at the circus. Sometime later, Helena becomes fascinated by the approach of a young man, strongly resembling Valentine, who wants to be a juggler for the circus.fictional place dream",False,tt0366780,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,866999,0,0,-3.6136154712981217,-2.6760407675788414,,,-3088668.0,15911332.0,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,159144735.5,6.0,182144735.5,2.0,-3329226.0,16.0,670774.0,1.0,67954044.0,4.0,87754044.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90189851.16666667,74589851.16666667,3.25,1.3333333333333333,109858494.28372188

Bruno is confined to the front grounds of their new home and craves companionship and adventure. He disobeys his parents by sneaking out and trekking through the woods to an isolated, unguarded corner of the camp, where he befriends Shmuel , a Jewish boy his own age. They meet in the same spot everyday. Bruno starts bringing Shmuel food and playing games with him through the barbed wire fence. Shmuel gradually reveals to Bruno the truth of what is behind the fence, telling him that he and his family have been imprisoned and forced to wear the ""striped pyjamas"" because they are Jews. On hearing this, Bruno remembers what he has been taught about Jewish people but realizes that Shmuel is not evil and continues their friendship. Bruno and Gretel get a tutor, Herr Liszt ([[Jim Norton , who pushes an agenda of antisemitism and nationalist propaganda. Gretel becomes increasingly fanatical in her support for the Third Reich, covering her bedroom wall with Nazi propaganda posters, much to the confusion of Bruno. She flirts with SS Lieutenant Kurt Kotler , her father's subordinate, as her budding sexuality becomes fixated on the ideal of the German soldier. Bruno remains skeptical of Nazi Propaganda, because all of the Jews Bruno knows, including the family's servant Pavel , do not resemble Liszt's teachings. One day, Kurt Kotler and Elsa are standing in the front yard when smoke  floats up from the camp. Kurt does not realise that Elsa doesn't know about the Jews being burnt, and says ""They smell even worse when they burn, don't they."" Ralf had been sworn to secrecy about the camp's true aims and hadn't told Elsa what was happening. Later, a blazing row between Elsa and Ralf occurs. It is insinuated that Elsa revealed who told her about the camp's secret. Ralf interrogates Kotler about his father's loyalty to the Nazis. This puts Kotler in a bad mood and when Pavel accidentally knocks over his glass while trying to fill it up, he drags him into another room and the sounds of the servant being severely beaten are heard. The following morning, the family' maid is shown scrubbing bloodstains off the floor and Elsa appears as though she has been crying. Gradually, Ralf is convinced that the house is no place for a child to grow up and makes arrangements for Elsa and the children to leave the area for a ""safer"" place with relatives, while he remains to ""finish his work"" at the camp. The day before Bruno is due to leave, Shmuel reveals that his father has gone missing in the camp. It is implied that he was taken into a gas chamber. Seeing an ideal opportunity to redeem himself for wronging Shmuel previously, Bruno digs a hole beneath the fence, changes into prison clothing that Shmuel has stolen for him, and enters the camp to help Shmuel find his father. Bruno is horrified by what he sees: the dehumanization, starvation and sickness are the antithesis of the Theresienstadt-esque propaganda film that had shaped his prior impressions. While searching for Shmuel's father, they are rounded up with others and marched to ""the showers"", the gas chambers. At the house, Bruno's absence is noticed. After Gretel and Elsa discover the open window Bruno went through and the remains of food Bruno was taking for Shmuel, Ralf and his guards mount a search to find him. They enter the camp, searching for Bruno. In the gas chambers, the inmates—including Bruno and Shmuel—are told to remove their clothes, amid speculation that it is only for a shower. While Bruno changes his clothes, he looks around and notices a man believed to be Pavel also in the gas chambers. The man sees him but then looks away. They are packed into the gas chambers, where Bruno and Shmuel take each other's hands. A soldier pours some Zyklon B pellets into the chamber. The prisoners start yelling and banging on the metal door. Ralf, still with his guards, arrives at an empty dormitory, signalling to him that a gassing is taking place. Ralf cries out his son's name and Elsa and Gretel fall to their knees. The film ends by showing the closed door of the now-silent gas chamber.nationalism concentration camp world war ii gas chamber nazi concentration camp prisoner children in wartime",False,tt0914798,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,20416563,0,0,0.63332504,-1.6278585820155915,9003376.0,22660518.85714286,70075702.2,94735979.1,764420472.0,895420472.0,2870249.0,1,6870249.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,314217016.0,4.0,414217016.0,2.0,,0.0,,,-1173477.0,22.0,2826523.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-1038779.0,3.0,661221.0,1.0,322409852.0,497409852.0,1.0,83447526.83333333,138280860.16666666,6.0,,,,,,,88588441.4,121988441.4,5.0,,,,15787233.0,21787233.0,1.0,143320669.16666666,186154002.5,6.0,57323869.75,82823869.75,4.0,,,,790574451.5,921824451.5,4.0,,,,15787233.0,21787233.0,1.0,18648777.5,32648777.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,15787233.0,21787233.0,1.0,,,,39887016.666666664,59387016.666666664,3.0,,,,,,,,,,-3928643.0,8071357.0,3.0,-3611233.0,27388767.0,1.0,,,,,,106143752.25,78718752.25,3.75,1.25,95612307.5388973

Fourteen-year-old Alan Tracy , sent off to a distant boarding school, is the youngest of the sons of Jeff Tracy, a retired American astronaut . Jeff, a widower, has formed International Rescue, and raised his sons to act as a secret, volunteer organisation which uses highly advanced technology to save lives worldwide. Jeff and his older sons ([[John Tracy  are joined in this effort by Lady Penelope and her butler/chauffeur Parker . Their futuristic hardware is largely developed by genius scientist Ray ""Brains"" Hackenbacker , who lives at the International Rescue base on Tracy Island, somewhere in the Pacific, along with his son, Alan's best friend, Fermat . There's also caretaker Kyrano , cook Onaha, and their beautiful adolescent daughter, Tintin , who appears edgy around Alan, which Lady Penelope observes is due to a budding romance between them. Alan is eager to join his family in their work, but his older brothers still see him as just their little kid brother; not ready for duty. During the movie Alan is grounded for spring break after he and Fermat sneak into the Thunderbird 1 silo and start the engines nearly revealing International Rescue's location. Ben Kingsley portrays the arch-villain known as The Hood, a character introduced in the first episode of the television series, brother of Kyrano. Bitter over having been abandoned and presumed dead by the Thunderbirds in an early rescue attempt, he has come to destroy them and take their machines to use in a daring raid on the Bank of England  vaults. He launches a missile to wreck Thunderbird 5, the orbiting communications station. The Tracys - except, of course, for Alan - launch into space aboard Thunderbird 3 to rescue John Tracy, who is manning the station when it is hit, and The Hood takes over the secret island base. Using his mental powers to overcome Brains' resistance, The Hood takes control of the Thunderbirds home base, aided by his confederates Transom  and strongman Mullion . He also disables the control systems, stranding the rescuers aboard the disintegrating Thunderbird 5, briefly transmitting a message to reveal his connections to the organisation's history. Alan, Tintin and Fermat, having observed the invasion of The Hood and his minions, then hearing his plans, launch a hasty resistance. Fermat disables heavy-lifter Thunderbird 2 as they retreat from the base, then flee to the mountaintop radio transmitter site. They make contact with Jeff Tracy, who tells them to wait for Lady Penelope to come and take charge. However, the impulsive Alan leads the other two teenagers into ill-planned action, resulting in their capture. Lady Penelope and Parker arrive on the Island to help Alan, but they find The Hood has taken the Tracy Mansion, and a fight begins with Lady Penelope and Parker against Mullion and Transom whom they managed to defeat but are likewise captured when they are overpowered by The Hood's mental powers, and Alan is forced to give Thunderbird 2s missing guidance processor to The Hood. The island's defenders all end up locked in the walk-in freezer while The Hood, Transom and Mullion head off to London. Escaping the freezer, the first order of business is to rescue Thunderbird 5 and the Tracys. Reporting The Hood's scheme, Alan gets his chance to go to work as he manages to convince Jeff to let him, Fermat and Tintin go after the Hood as his father and brothers would never make it in time. John, Brains and Lady Penelope back Alan up and Jeff reluctantly accepts. The three launch for London in Thunderbird 1, chaperoned by Lady Penelope and piloted by Alan and Fermat while Parker heads for the Bank of London to meet up with them in FAB 1. The Hood and his accomplices, having arrived in London, use International Rescue's drilling machine The Mole to begin tunnelling toward the vaults at the Bank, in the process damaging the support pylons for a public-transit monorail, which falls into the River Thames. Alan, Tintin and Fermat land next to Thunderbird 2, then they begin their rescue of the submerged monorail and its passengers. Alan turns over piloting duties to Fermat, then launches in the Thunderbird 4 rescue submarine. When Alan and Fermat are unable to connect the lifting cable, Tintin dives into the water, swims down to the stricken monorail where she secures the cable, then joins Alan aboard Thunderbird 4. Jeff and his other sons arrive just in time to see the successful rescue, then Jeff, Alan, Tintin and Fermat rush to the bank, where they are joined by Parker. Lady Penelope and Jeff get captured and Fermat and Parker defeat Mullion by working together. As Alan and Jeff try to find the Hood, Alan asks his father if the Hood was telling the truth about Jeff abandoning him, Jeff admitting that he left the Hood behind during the rescue but also admitting that he only did it because he couldn't see any way to save the Hood that wouldn't have resulted in the deaths of both. Alan and Hood fight while Tintin traps Transom. With Hood using his mental abilities, Alan starts to lose but Tintin arrives on the scene just in time. She then proves that she has mental powers similar to her uncle's and actually overpowers him in the resulting duel , which results in the evil Hood falling into mortal danger. Alan, who has to choose between saving the Hood and letting him die, saves him, saying, ""I don't want to save your life, but it's what we do.""

From the start, Linda is aware of Cole's gay feelings, but her love for and devotion to him are strong enough for her to overlook his romantic flings outside their marriage. After a while, she can no longer ignore the innuendos in his songs and their relationship grows strained. Cole is photographed in an amorous embrace with another man in the rest room of a gay nightclub, and both he and Linda are blackmailed into paying a heavy settlement to suppress publication of the pictures. When he shrugs off the blackmail, she finally goes to Paris, leaving him bereft. Not until he is injured in a horseback riding accident that seriously cripples him does she return to his side, willing to forgive but still finding it difficult to cope with his extramarital affairs. Eventually she is diagnosed with emphysema, and as she prepares herself and her husband for her impending death, she attempts to forge a relationship between him and her interior decorator so he'll have a companion following her death, which deeply affects him. The eventual amputation of his right leg adds to his deep depression, affecting his creative output.

His boss trusts him but is unaware that Mahowny is a compulsive gambler. Mahowny is soon skimming larger and larger amounts for his own use and making weekly trips to Atlantic City, where he is treated like a king by a greedy casino manager . Mahowny's girlfriend, fellow bank employee Belinda , can't understand what is happening. Mahowny's criminal acts come to light when Toronto police begin to investigate his longtime bookie . The movie's focus is on Mahowny as a character—how his compulsion drives him and all the domino effects it has on the rest of his life. The love story between Mahowny and Belinda and the inclusion of other finely drawn characters such as hapless casino employee Bernie  put the emphasis squarely on the gambling addiction, not on the flash and sizzle of big casinos or multi-million-dollar frauds. Film critic Roger Ebert named Owning Mahowny one of the top ten films of 2003.Ebert, Roger, Awake in the Dark: The Best of Roger Ebert.

As conversation ensues, they begin to flirt. Witty small talk about such topics as the wedding party and their own past relationships gradually reveals that they are not strangers, but in fact share an intimate past. A series of flashback scenes showing much younger versions of the two of them together confirms that they have been lovers. Despite having significant others  the couple choose to go upstairs to her hotel room together. However, their decision to sleep together is one which is clearly complex and fraught with emotional baggage for each of them. Again with flashbacks, a series of vignettes juxtaposes their earlier selves against the older, perhaps wiser couple in the hotel room as the two reminisce and reassess their feelings for each other. She must catch a transatlantic flight home to London in the morning, so the two leave the hotel together in the early morning. As they return to their separate lives, each speculates with their cab driver on the future and the difficulty of being happy.talking bridesmaid wedding reception wedding",False,tt0435623,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,973525,0,0,1.1633888888888888,-3.847336948521819,,,,,,,118135782.4,21,165335782.4,5.0,-14443133.5,4.0,11556866.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,109773545.0,159773545.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3261608.0,8761608.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,88446324.45,51846324.45,3.5714285714285716,3.5,92887866.92008553

His death sentence at the hands of the Daleks has been carried out. His last wish was for his remains to be returned to Gallifrey by his archenemy, the Doctor, currently in his seventh incarnation. During the trip back to Gallifrey in the Doctor's TARDIS, the vessel shakes, causing the box containing the Master's remains to shatter and allowing a sentient ooze to escape from it. The ooze enters the TARDIS controls and forces an emergency landing in Chinatown in San Francisco, California on New Year's Eve 1999. As the Doctor steps from the TARDIS to find his bearings, he is shot by a gang who are chasing down Chang Lee, a young Chinese-American man. Lee calls for an ambulance, and the Doctor is rushed to a nearby hospital. The surgeons find, through X-rays, that the Doctor has two hearts, but they assume the X-ray image is a double exposure. As cardiologist Dr Grace Holloway starts to operate with a cardiac probe, the Doctor wakes up, tells her that he needs a beryllium atomic clock, and then falls into a seizure, eventually flat-lining. Dr Holloway declares the Doctor dead, and his body is placed into a morgue. Lee steals the Doctor's possessions, including the TARDIS key, and runs off. Meanwhile, the ooze, which had stowed itself away on the ambulance, attacks and takes over the body of the ambulance driver, Bruce. When Bruce's wife questions his odd behaviour, the Master, now controlling his body, murders her. Late in the night, the Doctor regenerates into a new body, and leaves the morgue in a state of confusion, donning parts of costumes intended for the New Year's party later that night. He follows Dr Holloway as she leaves the hospital, and convinces her that he is the same man she operated on earlier. Dr Holloway, who has resigned from her job at the hospital, after the hospital covering up the Doctor's presence there, takes the Doctor home. Meanwhile, Lee has returned to the TARDIS with the key, and entered the time machine. The Master arrives soon afterwards and tells Lee that the Doctor stole the TARDIS from him, as well as his body, which he wants to retrieve. He convinces Lee to open the Eye of Harmony, thanks to his human retinal pattern. The Doctor recovers his memory and tries to keep his own eyes shut to prevent the Master from seeing through them, as that would allow him to take over the Doctor's body. The Doctor also warns Dr Holloway that if they do not shut the Eye before midnight, the entire planet may be sucked into it, and that to close it, he needs an atomic clock. Dr Holloway disbelieves the Doctor initially, but when he demonstrates that the nature of reality is already changing by walking through her bay windows without breaking them, she agrees to take him to the unveiling of an atomic clock at the San Francisco Institute of Technological Advancement and Research. They are given a lift to the Institute in an ambulance driven by Lee and the Master, whom the Doctor does not yet recognise. However, when the Master removes his sunglasses, revealing non-human eyes, the Doctor and Dr Holloway abandon the ambulance and steal a police motorcycle, but not before the Master is able to shoot Dr Holloway's wrist with a strange, bile-like fluid. At the Institute, the Doctor and Dr Holloway manage to collect the integrated circuit chip with the atomic clock mechanism by subterfuge, and make their way back to the TARDIS. Once there, the Doctor is able to install the chip and close the Eye, but discovers that that Eye has been open far too long, and that they must revert time to before the Eye was opened to prevent the destruction of the Earth. However, before the Doctor can route power to the TARDIS, the Master is able to use the bile on Dr Holloway's wrist to control her, and forces her to knock out the Doctor. The Doctor is chained above the Eye, his eyes forced open so as to allow the Master to take his remaining regenerations. When the Doctor awakes, he tries to talk Lee out of the Master's spell but to no avail; however, when the Master lies to Lee in order to get him to open the Eye again, Lee refuses, causing the Master to break his neck. The Master then uses his control of Dr Holloway to open the Eye, though this breaks his control of her. While the Master begins the process of transferring the Doctor's remaining regenerations to him, Dr Holloway is able to connect the last power circuit in the console room, sending the TARDIS into a time-holding pattern just moments after the turn of midnight, staving off destruction of the Earth. When Dr Holloway tries to return to help the Doctor, she is thrown over a balcony and killed by the Master, but her interference has given the Doctor enough time to push the Master into the Eye itself, apparently killing him. The action causes the Eye to close, and time to revert back to a few moments before midnight, bringing both Dr Holloway and Lee back to life. As the three recover, they find the world is safe. As Lee departs after returning the rest of the Doctor's possessions, the Doctor warns him not to be in San Francisco next year during New Year's Eve. The Doctor then asks Dr Holloway to travel with him in the TARDIS, but she politely refuses and also leaves. The Doctor returns to the TARDIS and pilots off to a new adventure.   * The television movie remains Paul McGann's sole televised story as the Doctor. It has nonetheless had a significant impact on the Doctor Who mythos, with an ongoing Doctor Who novel line, comic strip, and audio series that featured the Eighth Doctor for years, until and beyond the TV series' return in 2005. The Eighth Doctor has also featured in a series of BBC7 audio plays since 2007. * The Seventh Doctor is seen wearing a different costume from the one he wore during his 1987-1989 tenure: gone are the question mark pullover and umbrella. The costume does include the original hat, which is actually owned by Sylvester McCoy. * When reluctantly filling out an emergency medical treatment form, Chang Lee  gives the Doctor's name as ""John Smith"", a recurring alias originally given to the Second Doctor by companion Jamie McCrimmon in The Wheel in Space.{{cite book | last1  Paul | last2  Martin | last3  Keith | title  Doctor Who Books | year Daleks and the MasterThe TARDISReferences to other stories * The book that the Doctor sits down to read at the beginning and the end of the movie is The Time Machine by H. G. Wells. The Doctor shared an adventure with Wells in the Sixth Doctor serial Timelash and would meet him again in the Tenth Doctor comic ""The Time Machination"". In 1973's Frontier in Space, the Master is seen reading Wells' The War of the Worlds. In the untelevised story Shada, Professor Chronotis can be seen with a copy of The Time Machine, which is later visible throughout the episode. * This is one of six Doctor Who adventures to be set on New Year's Eve 1999 and New Year's Day 2000. The comic strip Plastic Millennium, published in the Doctor Who Magazine Winter 1994 Special; Craig Hinton's Virgin Missing Adventures novel Millennial Rites ; Justin Richards's Past Doctor Adventures novel Millennium Shock , the Short Trips: Seven Deadly Sins story ""Suitors, Inc.""  and the Fourth Doctor's segment from the comic The Forgotten  all take place on those dates, as do elements of the Torchwood episode ""Fragments"". * The ""time tunnel"" effect of the 2005 Doctor Who series onwards is reminiscent of the vortex that the TARDIS travels through in the opening credits and climax of the television movie.clock time time travel millenium space",False,tt0116118,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,42000000,1,0,7.4,-1.2635471289974909,,,,,,,109773545.0,4,159773545.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,159773545.0,109773545.0,0.5,1.0,56576255.24926193

One evening, Stingo learns from Sophie that she was married but her husband and her father were killed in a German work camp and that she was interned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Nathan is constantly jealous, and when he is in one of his violent mood swings he convinces himself that Sophie is unfaithful to him and abuses and harasses her. There is a flashback showing Nathan rescuing Sophie from near death from anemia shortly after her immigration to the U.S. Sophie  eventually reveals that her father was a Nazi sympathizer. Sophie had a lover, Józef , who lived with his half-sister, Wanda , a leader in the Resistance. Wanda tried to convince Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but Sophie declined, fearing she might endanger her children. Two weeks later Józef was murdered by the Gestapo, and Sophie was arrested and sent to Auschwitz with her children. Nathan tells Sophie and Stingo that the research he is doing at a pharmaceutical company is so groundbreaking that he will win the Nobel Prize. At a meeting with Nathan's physician brother, Stingo learns that Nathan is mentally ill  and that all of the schools that Nathan had attended were ""expensive funny farms.""  After Nathan discharges a firearm over the telephone in a violent rage, Sophie and Stingo flee to a hotel. She reveals to him the tragic choice she was forced to make at Auschwitz. Upon arrival, she was forced to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp. To avoid having both children killed, she chose her son, Jan , to be sent to the children's camp, and her daughter, Eva , to be sent to her death in Crematorium Two. Sophie and Stingo make love, but while Stingo is sleeping, Sophie, tormented by her memory, returns to Nathan. Sophie and Nathan commit suicide by taking cyanide. Stingo recites the poem ""Ample Make This Bed"" by Emily Dickinson—the American poet Sophie was fond of reading. Stingo moves away from Brooklyn to a small farm his father recently inherited in southern Virginia to finish writing his novel.new york city concentration camp holocaust (shoah) world war ii writer poland 1940s",False,tt0084707,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,30036000,0,0,1.5030000000000001,3.674315067367597,7000000.0,19000000.0,,,,,35000000.0,4,50000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-3889987.0,1.0,14110013.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,171438673.0,185438673.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32055006.5,15555006.5,0.625,1.0,64653273.14837625

Taking us through a day in Ian and Sam's life, the film opens by showing different events such as Sam getting burnt on a kettle, Ian's watch breaking, Sam getting Coca-Cola spilt on her and Ian being interrupted by Sam during an important meeting at work.  As the day progresses we see Ian in a taxi. He tells the driver  about how he and Sam are going through difficulties. The driver recommends he should just love her. After Sam's concert that night, Ian tries to dismiss Sam's favorite student. At dinner Sam confronts Ian where her frustration boils over. She gets angry at Ian for his attitude toward her and tells him that she just wants him to love her. Sam storms out of the restaurant in tears, Ian following close behind and asking for her forgiveness. Sam gets in a passing taxi and as Ian tries to get in beside her he notices that the driver is the same man who he traveled with earlier that day. The man gives Ian an ominous smile and as the clock hits 11 PM, Sam closes the door, leaving Ian standing there. As he watches the taxi drive away, Ian makes one last attempt to reconcile with Sam and runs after the taxi as it stops at a traffic light. Before he gets there, the lights change and the taxi begins driving again. As it speeds up, the taxi is struck violently by another car and comes to a stop on the middle of the street. Ian halts and falls on his knees in shock. At a nearby hospital, Sam is being taken into the ER and Ian is running through the hospital looking for her. He arrives outside the room where Sam was and through a windows sees her wounded and surrounded by medical personnel. Sam looks over to the window towards Ian, a blank expression on her face. Ian begins to cry and before the doctors can help her, Sam succumbs to her injuries and dies. Ian falls to the floor in the hospital in disbelief. We see Sam's friend Lottie  enter a hospital room, where Ian is sitting in a chair. They both begin to cry. Ian goes back to his apartment, finds Sam's notebook and opens it, finding a song she was working on. He falls asleep clutching the notebook close to him. As the next day begins, Ian wakes up with the notebook still held tight. He is shocked to hear a voice behind him tell him not to read a word. He jumps up and screams, only to see Sam standing in his apartment. After the initial confusion, Ian comes to the conclusion that the previous day must have been a dream and continues the morning, happy to have Sam by his side As the morning progresses however, Sam gets burnt by her hair straighteners in the same place she had been burnt by the kettle in his supposed dream. Able to shake this off as a sheer coincidence, Ian takes no further notice of it. Other events similar to those he already experienced begin happening too, although at different times and in different ways, as Sam gets Coca-Cola spilt on her. This time Ian mentions his dream to her, and she convinces him that it was just a dream, and if his watch remains in working order then it can't possibly be the same day as his dream. Nonetheless, Ian is still cautious, and while in a meeting at work he holds his folder in his hands. Sam sees this from outside the glass doors and his meeting is left uninterrupted. Later in the day, Ian gets into a taxi. After talking to the taxi driver he realizes that the driver is the man from the previous day. He questions the man about this and the driver says he does not remember, although he once again gives Ian an ominous smile, implying he may in fact know about Sam's accident and all the previous events. This convinces Ian once and for all, and he runs to Sam, who's helping her friend Lottie set up for an art gallery. After convincing her to come with him, he brings her to a train station. After much questioning Sam reveals they are traveling to Ian's rural home town. A delighted Sam makes sure that she'll be back in time for her concert, which Ian ensures they will be. Ian brings Sam up a mountain, to a spot he used to visit as a child. The two find a little abandoned cottage on the mountainside to use as shelter during a rain storm. Upon setting up a fire while Sam sits down, Ian notices that his watch is cracked and isn't working. He turns to look at Sam, who's lighting candles on a table. Sam smiles and when Ian asks what she would do if she didn't have a lot of time left, she replies that she'd do what she's doing right now; spending time with him, just being together. Ian and Sam begin kissing, before making love. Afterwards, they make their way back down the mountain, disappointed that they never made it to Ian's spot. In the town below, the two have drinks and Ian tells Sam about his father, who lost his beloved job in 1993 before becoming an alcoholic and dying sometime later. Ian reveals that he wishes he could have helped his father more, but Sam says he was only a child at the time and wherever his father is now, he's proud of him. The two travel back to London and Ian takes Sam on the London Eye as another surprise. They then travel back to their apartment and while Sam is distracted, Ian takes a page from her notebook and brings it to a nearby photocopying shop while Sam travels to her concert with her violin. Before the show begins Ian sends a bouquet of flowers up to Sam and gives the photocopied pages to an organizer. A puzzled Sam looks out to Ian in the crowd when her bouquet arrives. His plan is soon revealed however when Ian comes onto center-stage with a microphone. He calls a reluctant Sam to his side, who gets nervous. Ian goes and talks to Sam at her seat and tells her she doesn't want to disappoint her future fans. Sam proceeds onto the stage as the orchestra begins to play the song printed on Ian's photocopied sheets. She sings the song she wrote for Ian in her notebook and the crowd burst into applause at her performance. While walking to a restaurant of Sam's choice, she describes her feelings to Ian. In an intimate surrounding, Sam and Ian discuss the day in a sheer contrast to Ian's experience the previous night. Ian gives Samantha a charm bracelet with different charms and symbols: a musical note, a violin, a flower , the train they took that day and the Eiffel Tower, which Sam had always wanted to see. The two sit in silence as Sam tears up and smiles across at Ian. As they leave the restaurant in a downpour, Sam tries to get a taxi to take them home. Ian realizes they are in the same spot as the previous night when the accident took place and tells her to look at him and listen. In the rain, Sam listens as Ian professes his love for her and tells her that if it weren't for her or today, he would never have known true love at all. Sam begins crying and says she doesn't know what to say, to which he replies that she doesn't need to say anything. A taxi pulls up and Sam gets in, beckoning Ian to get in too. He gets in next to her. As the taxi approaches the traffic lights, Ian and Sam kiss. He looks forward and sees the clock strike 11 PM and the same ominous smile he has seen so many times already. Sam smiles at him as the taxi pulls away and images of Sam's accident flash through his mind. He sees a car light through his window and grabs Sam tight for the last time. Sam's scream can be heard. At the hospital, we see Sam's friend Lottie run through the halls. She turns a corner and enters a hospital room, where Sam is sitting in a bed. Sam tells Lottie about Ian's premonition and how she didn't believe him. She and Lottie begin to cry. In the end it was Ian who was the victim of the accident. Six months later, Sam is sitting in the apartment, with Ian's watch in her hands. Everything is packed into boxes and Sam takes a last look at the room. We see her singing on stage in a restaurant, with Lottie sitting at the closest table to her. She travels to the cottage on the mountain which she and Ian visited and continues climbing until she reaches Ian's spot at the peak of the mountain. She stands at the top, staring out into a valley, not knowing what lies ahead.loss of loved one love blood death of girlfriend death of boyfriend",False,tt0332136,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,3000000,0,0,4.631973086677943,1.9257596443831189,,,18025886.3,63325886.3,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,108502764.5,9.0,122502764.5,6.0,,0.0,,,3000000.0,1.0,10000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,-6595000.0,405000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,86542059.0,96542059.0,1.0,-11897601.666666666,10935731.666666666,3.0,,,,,,,,,,-3900000.0,2500000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,66251382.25,55751382.25,1.25,3.5,84824632.31357588

He knows he is close to a major academic breakthrough and desperately needs more time to complete his research. Thomas is given one last chance to finish his work, and goes to the Greek island of Spetses, where he has been invited to stay at the home of a supportive Oxford don Professor Coulter. Thomas brings along his 12 year-old daughter, Serena . The house is in tolerable condition, and Serena finds a book about mermaids that has an ancient Greek inscription on the cover. Serena is supportive of her father and readily asks him about ancient mythology, but feels that he dedicates too much of himself to his work. The pair meet a fisherman named Captain Mavros  and his son Dimitri ; Dimitri develops a crush on Serena. Neried, who can only gain legs at night, travels on land to meet Thomas. When they initially cannot get along, Serena asks that Neried only help her father translate some old relics for his work. Neried does, and when she and Thomas speak the ancient love spell in unison, they fall in love with each other. Thomas realizes that the writing on the book Serena had discovered earlier is the key to understanding all the ancient text, enabling him to continue his work.mermaid beautiful woman",True,tt0918628,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,9216,0,0,-1518.0972222222226,-6.117028646878049,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,105980128.20199434

Adela Quested  and Mrs. Moore  sail from England to India, where Ronny Heaslop , the older woman's son and younger woman's fiancé, is the local magistrate in the provincial town of Chandrapore. Through school superintendent Richard Fielding , the two visitors meet eccentric elderly Brahmin scholar Professor Godbole , and they befriend Dr. Aziz Ahmed , an impoverished widower who initially meets Mrs. Moore in a moonlit mosque overlooking the Ganges River. Their sensitivity and unprejudiced attitude toward native Indians endears them to him. When Mrs. Moore and Adela express an interest in seeing the ""real"" India, as opposed to the Anglicised environment of cricket, polo, and afternoon tea the British expatriates have created for themselves, Aziz offers to host an excursion to the remote Marabar Caves. The outing goes reasonably well until the two women begin exploring the caves with Aziz and his sizable entourage. Mrs. Moore experiences an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia that forces her to return to the open air. She encourages Adela and Aziz to continue their exploration but suggests they take only one guide. The three set off for a series of caves far removed from the rest of the group, and before entering, Aziz steps aside to smoke a cigarette. He returns to find Adela has disappeared; shortly after he sees her running headlong down the hill, bloody and dishevelled. Upon their return to town, Aziz is jailed to await trial for attempted rape, and an uproar ensues between the Indians and the Colonials. The case becomes a cause celebre among the British. When Mrs. Moore makes it clear she firmly believes in Aziz's innocence and will not testify against him, it is decided she should return to England. She subsequently suffers a fatal heart attack during the voyage and is buried at sea. To the consternation of her fiancé and friends, Adela has a change of heart and clears Aziz in open court. The Colonials are forced to make an ignominious retreat while the Indians carry the exonerated man out of the courtroom on their shoulders, cheering wildly. Fielding looks after Adela as she has no one else to turn to. In the aftermath, Miss Quested breaks off her engagement and leaves India, while Dr. Aziz, feeling betrayed by his friend Fielding, abandons his Western attire, dons traditional dress, and withdraws completely from Anglo-Indian society, opening a clinic in Northern India, in Kashmir near the Himalayas. Although he remains angry and bitter for years, he eventually reconciles with Fielding and writes to Adela to convey his thanks and forgiveness.based on novel or book cave hindu doctor india 1920s mosque british raj",False,tt0087892,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,27187653,0,0,2.398456625,3.9275459302257203,17165680.923076924,23673373.230769232,6193169.0,21833169.0,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,24350000.0,19.0,29950000.0,1.0,42190437.0,27.0,58440437.0,4.0,53472904.0,3.0,58972904.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-7410692.0,589308.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,65920582.666666664,75587249.33333333,3.0,,,,,,,,,,6640084.0,14560084.0,1.0,,,,,,,20300291.0,34700291.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,25781695.0,44781695.0,1.0,18400000.0,30400000.0,1.0,,,,21010864.0,26010864.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,49121113.666666664,40004447.0,6.125,2.0,48770840.0372125

Meanwhile, Thomas and Gordon encounter an evil diesel locomotive, Diesel 10, stating that he has unfinished business on Sodor. He is planning to get rid of steam engines on Sodor once and for all. Mr. Conductor has problems of his own. The mysterious gold dust that allows him to magically transport from place to place is running out, and without it there will be no way for anyone to travel from Shining Time to Sodor or back again. There is a lost engine that is able to travel between Sodor and Muffle Mountain using the Magic Railroad, but nobody knows where she is. Burnett Stone, an elderly man, lives on Muffle Mountain, near Shining Time Station, in which Stacy Jones was the manager. Unknown to everyone, he is the guardian of the lost engine, whose name is Lady. The engine crashed after an earlier encounter with Diesel 10, and ever since then Burnett has been trying to repair Lady. Even though he seems to have gotten the little engine restored mechanically, so far he has been unable to make her steam. Percy and Thomas find out that there is a secret railway and there are magic buffers that lead to it. However, Diesel 10 overhears them. Toby the Tram Engine follows D-10 and hears him telling his diesel locomotive henchmen Splatter and Dodge of his plans to destroy the steam locomotives. Diesel 10 thinks that this horrid act seems possible mainly because Mr. Conductor's whistle contains gold dust inside which he uses to travel is running out, and he is therefore becoming too weak to stop Diesel 10. Wanting to warn his friends of Diesel's plans, Toby rings his bell, distracting them. Burnett's granddaughter Lily visits him, and meets C. Junior, Mr. Conductor's good-natured but lazy cousin, who takes her to Sodor and introduces her to the talking engines who live there, including Thomas. Later, Thomas is assigned to transport Lily back to Burnett on Muffle Mountain after inadvertently discovered the entrance of the long-abandoned Magic Railroad by an old grotto. He takes his lost truck of special Island-of-Sodor coal and arrives on the other end of the Magic Railway, located at the edge of a high cliff near the top of Muffle Mountain. Lily goes to her grandfather's house, leaving Thomas stranded on the mountain. However, the ground gives way and Thomas uncouples himself from the coal-truck, falling off the cliff to the bottom of the mountain where he re-enters the Magic Railroad through another portal there. Lily reunites with Burnett at his workshop, where he shows her Lady and explains his problem getting the engine to steam. Using the Sodor coal truck, the engine eventually comes to life. Lily and Burnett take Lady along the Magic Railroad, regenerating itself in the process. Lady comments that Burnett had never forgotten about Magic. They reunite with Thomas and find their way back to Sodor, where Diesel 10 finds them and goes after them. When Thomas and Lady cross the Viaduct, it begins to collapse. Lady makes it across, and Thomas gets across a 3 foot gap in the supports. After 2 big sections fall off, Diesel 10 crosses. The suspended pieces of track can't hold him and he falls off. That sends him falling into the ravine below, where he lands in a barge filled with sludge and is carried away. Thomas, Lady, Burnett and Lily meet Mr. Conductor and C-Junior. They use the water from a wishing well and shavings from the rails of the Magic Railroad to make more gold dust, and the Island of Sodor and Shining Time Station are saved. C-Junior, encouraged by his success in being able to help out, offers to take a job on Sodor, and Mr. Conductor presents him with his conductor's cap so that C-Junior can now take over Mr. Conductor's role on Sodor, while Mr. Conductor says that he will now travel back to serve at Shining Time Station. In the end Thomas is happily going home to Tidmouth Sheds to tell the engines about his encounter with the lost engine Lady.woman director",False,tt0205461,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,15911332,1,0,-0.19411750065927846,-1.1627692044360227,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,76394553.2193505

He phones Ezra Lieberman , an aging Nazi hunter living in Austria, with this information. A highly skeptical Lieberman tries to brush Kohler's claims aside, telling him that it is a long-established fact that Mengele is dead. Having learned when and where the next meeting to include Mengele is scheduled to occur, Kohler records part of it using a hidden microphone, but is discovered and killed while making another phone call to Lieberman. Aware that something is wrong, Lieberman follows Kohler's leads and begins travelling throughout Europe and North America to investigate the suspicious deaths of a number of middle-aged civil servants. He meets several of their widows and is amazed to find an uncanny resemblance in their adopted, black-haired, blue-eyed sons. It is also made clear throughout the film that, at the time of their deaths, all the civil servants were aged around 65 and had a cold, domineering, and abusive attitude towards their adopted sons, while their wives were aged around 42 and doted on the sons. Lieberman gains insight from Frieda Maloney , an incarcerated former Nazi guard who worked with the adoption agency, before realizing during a meeting with Professor Bruckner , an expert on cloning, the terrible truth behind the Nazi plan: Mengele, in the 1960s, had secluded several surrogate mothers in a Brazilian clinic and fertilised them with ova each carrying a sample of Hitler's DNA preserved since World War II. 94 perfect clones of Hitler had then been born and sent to different parts of the world for adoption. As Lieberman uncovers more of the plot, Mengele's superiors become more unnerved. After Mengele happens to meet  one of the agents he believes is in Europe implementing his scheme, Mengele's principal contact, Eduard Seibert , informs him that the scheme has been aborted before Lieberman can expose it to the authorities. Mengele storms out, pledging that the operation will continue. Seibert and his men go to set fire to Mengele's jungle estate after killing his servants and guards. Mengele himself, however, has already left, intent on trying to continue his plan. He travels to rural Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, where one of the Hitler clones, Bobby Wheelock , lives on a farm with his parents. There he murders the boy's father , a Doberman dog breeder, and lies in wait for Lieberman, who is on his way to the farm to warn Mr. Wheelock of Mengele's intention to kill him. The instant Lieberman arrives and sets eyes on Mengele, he attacks the doctor in a fury. But Mengele soon gains the upper hand and holds him at gunpoint. He taunts Lieberman by explaining his plan to return Hitler to the world. Then, with one desperate lunge, Lieberman opens the closet where the Dobermans are held and turns them loose. The dogs corner Mengele and begin to attack him. At that point, Bobby arrives home from school. It is Mengele's first look at one of his clones. Bobby calls off the dogs and tries to find out what has happened. Bobby can tell from the carnage that something is amiss. The injured Mengele tells Bobby how much he admires him, and explains that he is cloned from Hitler. But Bobby doubts his story and is also suspicious because the dogs are trained to attack anyone who threatens his family. Lieberman tells Bobby that Mengele has killed his father and urges him to notify the police. Bobby checks the house and eventually finds his dead father in the basement. He rushes back upstairs and sets the vicious dogs on Mengele once again, relishing his bloody death. Bobby then proceeds to help Lieberman, whom Mengele has shot and wounded, but only after Lieberman promises not to tell the police about the incident. Later, while recovering from his wounds, Lieberman is encouraged by an American Nazi-hunter, David Bennett  to expose Mengele's scheme to the world. He asks Lieberman to turn over the list  identifying the names and whereabouts of the other boys from around the world, so that they can be systematically killed before growing up to become bloody tyrants. Lieberman objects on the grounds that they are mere children. He burns the list before anyone can read it. In the final scene, Bobby is shown in his darkroom, absorbed and excited by photographs that he has taken of Mengele's body after it has been savaged by the dogs.based on novel or book paraguay mengele doberman nazi hunter third reich",False,tt0077269,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,19000000,0,0,0.5833333333333334,15.1328345263288,,,,,,,40511490.0,17,44911490.0,2.0,,0.0,,,7250000.0,16.0,9250000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,3000000.0,2.0,8000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,58122980.0,60922980.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,82222829.0,95972829.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,131005336.5,141505336.5,2.0,-6000000.0,1000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20720496.666666668,16920496.666666668,4.375,1.3333333333333333,68011965.11413558

He discovers and follows a garbage truck. His children, Buster  and Petunia  think he was kidnapped and leave a note for their mother Joan. The note said: ""police kidnapped your kids"" While at the dump, Stanley overheard a meeting of corrupt army officials promising several foreign representatives large amounts of contraband. Stanley poses as one of the foreigners, and talks with Colonel Neidermeyer . Neidermeyer is convinced that Stanley is a secret agent. Shortly afterward, he tells Lieutenant Neal , one of his subordinate assassins, to kill him. Meanwhile, the children are brought home by the police only to discover that their mother is gone too. After the two find an advertisement for a Chinese restaurant, they go to the restaurant. There, Buster receives a fortune cookie that says ""Time flies when you're having fun."" Believing this is the Daily Times newspaper, the children go to the newspapers offices. The computer prompts them for a headline, and after telling Buster  and Joan that computer language is alien, Petunia inputs ""alien picks nose"". The computer then requests a picture, at which they try to slide a photograph of Stanley into the floppy drive. The family reunites at their house and Stanley explains a conspiracy he discovered at the dumpster. Years ago, while working for as a ""courier for the government"" , he noticed an inordinate amount of letters marked ""return to sender"". Thinking ""sender"" was a person's name, he reported this to his superior, who promptly fired him. He believes Mr. Sender  accumulates letters, has bribed the police into stealing people's children. The Stupid's children suggest looking for ""Sender"" in the telephone directory, and find a Charles Sender  who works at the Museum of Natural History. At the museum, they split up and sneak in. Buster and Joan find a display of several dates and events, ending at an elevator which had buttons for floors A-D and 1-9. Believing it to be a time machine, Buster presses several random numbers and the letters B and C. The elevator takes them to a display about dinosaurs, and Buster writes his name on the wall, believing it will be the first thing humans will read. Petunia and Stanley, meanwhile, enter Sender's office and find his daily planner. On their way out, they enter a planetarium. Suddenly, the planetarium show begins. They are discovered by a janitor named Lloyd , who they take as ""The Lord"". The family reunites again outside the museum. Stanley and Petunia tell Joan and Buster that Sender was going to a television studio. The studio kicks them out. Neidermeyer realizes Stanley hasn't been assassinated when he sees him on TV singing ""I'm My Own Grandpa"". He kidnaps Stanley and brings him to the army base, and his family follow but are not allowed in. Stanley is tied to a chair and interrogated, but refuses to give away anything. Just when he is about to be beaten, one of his guards spits a wad of chewing gum on the floor. Remembering the museum janitor's words, he finds the strength to escape and rejoin his family. Stanley tells of the nefarious plot he heard that will take ""... place  Warehouse 21"". Arriving in the middle of the night, they sneak in to discover huge stores of weapons. They order the corrupt officials to surrender, and soon find themselves under attack. After a series of humorous struggles, they manage to get the police's attention. All the corrupt officers are arrested except for Neidermeyer. Stanley approaches Sender and tells him he needs to turn his life away from evil. Thinking these are road directions, Sender thanks him. When the Stupids return home, they find Neidermeyer waiting to kill them. Before he can pull the trigger, Neidermeyer tells them that no guardian angel can save them, at which point the takeout-delivery man Joan called earlier barges in, knocking him out with the door. The family believes that delivery man to be working for ""The Lloyd"", when in fact the man's boss' name is Floyd. Meanwhile, a nose-picking alien in a space ship passes an edition of the newspaper Joan and the children were in earlier. Upon seeing ""Alien picks nose"" with Stanley's photo on the front cover, they set off to Earth to kill him. The film ends as Stanley is grilling hamburgers outside. Buster says he wants to try, at which point the aliens appear in the yard. Oblivious to the aliens, Stanley tries to explain to Buster that he is too little to do it. In the process, he inadvertently sets the aliens on fire, and they teleport away.conspiracy theory aftercreditsstinger",False,tt0117768,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,2491989,0,0,-9.032147011884883,-1.2635471289974909,7762085.0,31262085.0,13624501.333333334,27553834.666666668,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,27385519.333333332,30.0,33145645.666666668,3.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21973249.0,31973249.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33145645.666666668,27385519.333333332,3.75,3.0,56576255.24926193

She knocks and a woman answers the door. Kate explains that although she doesn't know her she has a long story to explain. The story begins with the death of her grandfather, Edmund Collins. The movie then goes on to show how all the family members found out about the death, and how they came together for the funeral. As the Collins family joins their widowed mother/grandmother, Charlotte Collins , the family's dysfunctions and idiosyncrasies come to light. Kate's father, Daniel Collins , is an ""obscure foreign film"" actor whose career peaked at age 8 when he appeared in a peanut butter commercial. Kate's uncle, Skip Collins , is an overly hormonal father of overly hormonal twin sons  who managed to run their mother out of their family. Kate's aunt, Lucy Collins , and her girlfriend Judy Arnolds  are both criticised throughout the movie because of their relationship. Most of this criticism comes from Kate's other aunt, Alice Collins . The bossy, intimidating Alice has managed to both raise her three children and drive her husband into submissive silence, because of her persistent talking and badgering. Once they all arrive at the only family home Kate is told by Charlotte that her grandfather wished for her to give the eulogy at the funeral. After a family dinner that goes south when Lucy and Judy announce that they are getting married, tired of the family feuding, Charlotte tries to commit suicide by overdosing on a medication. While the family sits in the waiting room they run into Samantha  a nurse at the hospital who is also an old friend of Alice's. After having her stomach pumped and after rejoining the family, she tries again by jumping out of a moving van on a bridge and although she does not die, she is seriously injured and spends the remainder of the movie in a wheelchair. During the film, Kate continually tries to come up with a eulogy while dealing with a previous romance with Ryan, from whom she ran away after being caught by Ryan's mother who came home while Ryan and Kate were having sex. Kate gets reacquainted with Ryan  and their relationship reignites. At Edmund's will reading, it is revealed that Edmund has three families that don't know about each other. This explains Edmund's inability to keep names and number of children straight over the years before also dropping the bomb that he was up to his ""prostate in debt"". Kate is tasked with finding and telling the other two families of Edmund's demise. Ultimately, per Edmund's will, he is placed in a casket and floated out on a local lake in a boat. Ted and Fred, having previously filled the casket with gasoline, start shooting fiery arrows from a bow at the casket. During this time Kate finally gives her eulogy. One of the arrows eventually hits the casket and a moment later the casket, completely unexpectedly, explodes in a fiery explosion and completely demolishes the boat, body, and casket in a splintery mess. The movie ends with Kate talking to the woman from the beginning of the film. The woman explains she is not actually the person she was looking for but rather her neighbor.funeral family secrets dysfunctional family death in family family conflict",False,tt0349416,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,70527,0,0,-140.78966920470174,1.9257596443831189,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,294194034.0,9.0,352194034.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-1577515.0,4.0,33422485.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2315140.0,50315140.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-6083697.0,3916303.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-14000000.0,13000000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,192808259.5,146308259.5,1.625,1.0,84824632.31357588

Soon Heidi and her cohorts find that the gig is far from the rock spectacle they’re expecting; the original Lords of Salem are returning, and they’re out for blood.witch salem, massachusetts coven satanic",False,tt1731697,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1165882,1,0,-0.2865796023954397,-10.812845724436539,-14131561.0,868439.0,-5165843.5,8084156.5,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,111692319.0,37.0,112892319.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-5851171.0,21148829.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,112892319.0,111692319.0,4.625,1.0,123186632.01668148

There he snags Miranda, a real mermaid, and is pulled into the water. She keeps him prisoner in her underwater cavern and only lets him go after he agrees to show her London. He disguises her as an invalid patient in a wheelchair and takes her to his home for a month-long stay. Martin’s wife Clare reluctantly agrees to the arrangement, but gets him to hire someone to look after their guest. He selects Nurse Carey for her eccentric nature and takes her into his confidence. To Paul's relief, Carey is delighted to be working for a mermaid. Miranda’s seductive nature earns her the admiration of not only Paul, but also his chauffeur Charles and Nigel, the fiancé of Clare's friend and neighbour Isobel, arousing the jealousy of the women in their lives. Nigel breaks off his engagement, but when he and Charles discover that Miranda has been flirting with both of them, they come to their senses. Clare finally figures out what sort of creature Miranda really is. Miranda overhears her telling Paul that the public must be told. She wheels herself down to the river and makes her escape.

At first, Lee is reluctant to go to the college due to his father's limited income, but he finally does attend. Once in England, Lee brags about his athletic triumphs to Paul Beaumont ([[Griffith Jones , Wavertree , and Ramsey  on the train to Oxford. Annoyed, they trick Lee Sheridan into getting off the train at the wrong stop. However, Lee does make his way to Oxford where the students attempt to trick him again, this time into thinking that he is getting a grand reception. Seeing through the deception, he follows the prankster impersonating the Dean and after chasing him is thrown off and ends up kicking the real Dean of Cardinal  before retreating. Lee considers leaving Oxford but stays on after being convinced by Scatters , his personal servant. Lee meets Elsa Craddock   and starts a relationship with Paul Beaumont's sister Molly . Lee makes the track team and just when he begins to fit in he is hazed for pushing Paul out of the way during a track meet when asked to rest. In a fit of anger, Lee goes to a local bar and finds Paul in a private booth with Elsa. He starts to fight with Paul when Wavertree comes in and warns them of campus officials coming. Lee and Paul run and when they are almost caught by one of the campus officials Lee punches him. Wavertree tells his friends that he saw Paul throw the punch and it is Paul who gets in trouble for hitting the official. He is scorned for saying it was Lee who punched him and Lee is soon the favorite of Paul's old friends. Molly begins to see him again, but Lee still feels poor for what has happened between her and Paul. Lee begins rowing and tries to make amends to Paul after winning a race, but Paul rejects the offer of friendship. Though his offer of friendship was rejected, Lee still helps Paul by hiding Elsa in his own room when Elsa is looking for Paul. The Dean catches the two of them together and expels Lee from Oxford. Lee's father, Dan Sheridan , comes for the bump races having not heard of Lee's expulsion from Oxford University. When Lee tells him that he had been having an affair with Elsa, Dan believes he is lying. Judging from Lee's letters about Molly he feels that Lee could not possibly have had an affair with Elsa due to the way he feels about Molly. Dan meets with Molly and the two devise a plan to get Lee back into college. Dan meets with Elsa at the bookstore and convinces her to talk to the Dean. After flirting with the Dean and telling him that Lee was only hiding her from Wavertree, Lee is allowed back into Oxford and Wavertree  is let off with a slap on the wrist.

The film opens in a remote wood building with a violent gunfight between the police and Charlie Burns'  gang, which ends with the deaths of all of the gang members except for Charlie. Captain Stanley  makes a proposition to Charlie: he and the feeble-minded Mikey can go free of the crimes they have committed if Charlie kills his older brother, Arthur . Arthur is a mercurial psychopath who has become something of a legend and is so vicious the Aboriginal tribes refer to him as ""The Dog Man"" and both the police and the Aboriginals refuse to go near his camp. Captain Stanley states his intention to civilize the harsh Australian wilderness by bringing Arthur to justice and using Mikey as leverage. Charlie has nine days to find and kill Arthur, or else Mikey will be hanged from the gallows on Christmas Day. It is discovered why Captain Stanley is intent on taming Australia: he has been forced to move there with his delicate wife, Martha Stanley , and apparently wants to make it a safer place for them to live. The Stanleys were friends of the Hopkins family, leading Martha to have nightmares about her dead friends and the unborn child one of them was carrying. Word spreads of Stanley's deal with Charlie, primarily from Stanley's corrupt subordinate, Sergeant Lawrence ([[Robert Morgan , causing disgust among the townspeople. Shortly thereafter, Eden Fletcher , for whom Captain Stanley works, orders that Mikey be given one hundred lashes as punishment for the rape and murder of the Hopkins family. Stanley is aghast at this, not only because he believes Mikey is likely innocent and the flogging may kill him or harm him irreparably, but also because it will break his deal with Charlie and bring the Burns gang's revenge upon him and his wife. Stanley sends Sergeant Lawrence away with tracker Jacko  and other men to ""investigate"" the reported slaying of Dan O'Riley by a group of Aborigines. Meanwhile, Charlie rides a great distance in search of Arthur, drinking and apparently reflecting on what he will do. Along the way, he encounters an inebriated old man named Jellon Lamb . In the course of conversation, Charlie realizes that Lamb is a bounty hunter in pursuit of the Burns brothers and knocks him out. Later on, after sleeping on a rock bed, Charlie awakes and, before he can gather what is going on, is speared in the chest by a group of Aboriginal men standing over him. Seconds later a gunshot is heard and the head of the man who threw the spear explodes. Charlie then passes out. Charlie wakes up in the camp of his brother Arthur, located in caves among desolate mountains. Arthur's gang consists of Samuel Stoat , who shot the Aboriginal man who had speared Charlie; a woman named Queenie  who tends to Charlie's wound; and a muscular Aboriginal man called Two-Bob . As he recovers from his wounds, Charlie has several opportunities to kill his brother, but does not. Captain Stanley attempts to defend Mikey by gunpoint from the bloodthirsty townspeople, but is overruled once Martha arrives, insisting on revenge for her dead friends. Mikey is brutally flogged and horrifically wounded. The formerly excited townspeople slowly become disgusted and Martha faints at the ghastly display. After 40 lashes, Mikey has collapsed and the whip is soaked with blood. Captain Stanley grabs the whip and throws it at Fletcher, staining his face and suit with blood. In response, Fletcher fires Stanley. Not too far away from Arthur's camp, Sergeant Lawrence and his men have found and butchered a group of Aborigines. Arthur and Two-Bob find Lawrence's group while they sleep, ostensibly to get a horse for Charlie, and proceed to kill Jacko and Sergeant Lawrence. Before Arthur stomps Lawrence to death with his boot, Lawrence tells Arthur that Charlie has been sent to kill him. While this occurs, Jellon Lamb enters Arthur's camp and ties up Samuel and Charlie, both of whom are sleeping. Without his realizing it, Lamb is shot from behind by the returning Arthur. Arthur then proceeds to begin torturing the still-living Lamb with a knife. Charlie points his revolver at Arthur, but instead shoots Jellon in the head, putting him out of his misery. Charlie decides he wants to break out Mikey and informs Arthur. Arthur, Samuel and Charlie ride into town dressed in the clothes taken from the officers Arthur and Two-Bob had killed, pulling behind them Two-Bob, posing as an Aborigine they have captured. Once at the jail, the men free Mikey, and Charlie and Two-Bob ride off with him. Arthur and Samuel remain to torture and slaughter the two officers inside the jail. The badly injured Mikey, who has never recovered from the flogging, dies in Charlie's arms. As they bury Mikey, Two-Bob tells Charlie that all of this is Charlie's fault: ""You should never have left us."" Captain Stanley and Martha, who had become increasingly paranoid as they were ostracized by the townspeople after the flogging, let their guard down to have a peaceful, civilized Christmas dinner. Immediately following their conclusion of grace, Arthur and Samuel shoot open the door and invade their home. Arthur pulls Captain Stanley into the other room and brutally beats him, while Samuel taunts his wife. Arthur then calls Samuel to the room. Samuel drags Martha inside, and Arthur shoots Captain Stanley through the shoulder. As Samuel rapes Martha, Charlie walks in and informs Arthur of Mikey's death; Arthur ignores the news and encourages Charlie to listen to Samuel's beautiful singing. Charlie walks up to the unsuspecting Samuel and shoots him point blank in the head, then shoots Arthur twice, saying afterward, ""No more."" Arthur staggers out of the house. Charlie looks at a gun on the table that could potentially be picked up to shoot him and tells Captain Stanley ""I want to be with my brother."" Charlie leaves the house and follows a trail of blood to find Arthur seated on the ground nearby and sits down next to him. Arthur states that Charlie has finally stopped him and asks what he will do now, to no answer, and dies as his brother watches the blood red sunset of the outback.gallows australia psychopath outlaw misanthrophy gang shootout sadist brutality violence hideout retribution flogging whipping sunset aborigine savagery",False,tt0421238,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,5048693,0,0,1.5243465,-2.6760407675788414,-2529224.0,9395776.0,,,,,-11132772.0,6,32117228.0,2.0,44713106.0,4.0,106863106.0,2.0,,0.0,,,26034835.5,1.0,48534835.5,2.0,,0.0,,,21104296.375,39.0,39966796.375,8.0,19187653.0,21.0,27187653.0,1.0,193237075.5,2.0,315737075.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-5689058.5,11810941.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,29121574.75,50571574.75,4.0,,,,,,,84823223.0,89656556.33333333,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,73708457.0,95708457.0,1.0,-7417311.0,9582689.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,95067782.39583333,48857365.729166664,9.125,2.8333333333333335,109858494.28372188

They travel with their instructor Jake Harris  to a small island off the coast of Virginia in order to complete a profiling exercise. The island is used as a training facility by the FBI and the military where a mock town has been constructed. Harris has arranged an elaborate training scenario for his students whereby their mission is to create a profile of a serial killer who has committed a murder in the town. The students include Bobby , a young man with a talent for fixing things; Vince , a wheelchair-using ex-cop who goes nowhere without his gun; Nicole , a smoker who is attempting to quit; Sara , a talented but insecure profiler who is also petrified of drowning; Gabe , an outside observer; Rafe ([[Will_Kemp_, a very intelligent, caffeine-powered British investigator; Lucas , a supposedly fearless man whose parents were killed when he was a child; and J.D. , their leader and Nicole's lover. They arrive on the island and commence their investigation the following day. The group encounters an elaborate, Rube Goldberg or Heath Robinson style trap. J.D.'s position as leader of the group prompts him to investigate it more closely. His actions have fatal consequences as he is killed by liquid nitrogen. Convinced that this was not an accident, the group heads to the dock to leave the island. They fear that a killer is on the island with them. Their actions trigger another trap, this one destroying the boat they were going to use in order to escape. While recuperating from the last trap, Rafe makes some coffee which turns out to be drugged, knocking everyone out. They come to discover that Rafe has been decapitated and exsanguinated while unconscious and that the killer has painted an elaborate group of numerical ciphers using Rafe's drained blood. Tensions run high among the group, and rest of the film focuses on their efforts to find and use messages from the killer as well as the resources at hand  to learn when more victims will be killed while attempting to deduce which of them is the killer. At first, suspicions seem to point to Gabe because of a map of the island found next to his bed. He temporarily deflects this when he saves Vince from yet another trap, although this indirectly leads to Bobby's death; due to his mechanical nature & while trying to shut off a water valve, he unknowingly triggers a device that fires a harpoon-tipped fletchet into his neck. Later, the results of a blood analysis collected from scraped skin samples found under Rafe's fingernails point to Sara, who denies being the killer; Lucas supports her. Nicole ultimately decides she cannot trust any of her colleagues and leaves while holding the others at gunpoint, resulting in her death; the stress of the situation causes her to relapse into her smoking addiction and while walking outside, she finds spontaneously vended pack of cigarettes. She steps out to smoke one and quickly learns that it has been laced with a strong acid, which eats her alive from the inside as Gabe and Lucas stare on in horror. Sara, meanwhile, finally deduces that the traps are based on their strengths, talents, and weaknesses and the remaining profilers elect to stick together, to keep an eye on each other. Unexpectedly, the island's speakers begin to broadcast a taunting message from none other than Harris, making them realize that he did not leave the island, though he led the profilers to believe that he had; convinced that he has been the killer all along, they search for him. Later, however, Sara, Gabe and Lucas find Harris and two other FBI agents next to him, all dead; Harris has been strung up to wires from the ceiling as a sort of marionette, just like the fake crime scene that they were to investigate. The three survivors quickly realize that the killer is one of them, and in the shootout that ensues, Gabe seemingly takes out Lucas. At the same time, Vince manages to crawl to the elevator but hears someone coming toward him. He fires his gun  at the stranger, but it has been tampered with by the killer and explosively misfires, sending shards into his face and arm. Gabe and Sara then confront each other, each believing the other to be the serial killer. Lucas, who was wearing a bullet-proof vest, returns and jumps Gabe from behind. The two violently attack one another, eventually falling through a glass ceiling. Gabe starts to get up but is knocked unconscious by Sara, who then begins to tend to Lucas. Sara explains to Lucas the trick up her sleeve: she set a trap taking into account the killer’s obsession with time. However, this reveals that Lucas, not Gabe, is the real mastermind. Lucas says he was the one who murdered his parents, but after no one suspected him, he grew bored and required more intelligent peers as worthy prey. Lucas muses that Sara has another weakness besides a fear of water: ""Me"". Lucas tries to drown Sara, but she manages to kick him into the water and an underwater gunfight ensues. In the end, after a feigned drowning, Sara gains the upper hand and wounds Lucas. Intending to survive, Lucas begins to taunt her about the evidence he planted blaming her, until Gabe reappears: he is the last witness.

In the town of Glipforg, Lem  is a teenage boy with a new part-time job at the local planetarium and a long-time crush on his neighbor Neera . His best friend is Skiff , a big fan of the Humaniacs films. At a barbecue Neera's family is having, Lem tries to ask Neera on a date; but her hippie friend, Glar, keeps interrupting with his protest songs. Just then, a mysterious spacecraft goes into orbit around Planet 51 and sends out a signal. Down on Planet 51, under a secret Army base called ""Base 9"" , there is a basement filled with Earth artifacts including robotic satellites launched by the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The spacecraft's signal activates Rover, a wheeled A.I. probe. Rover escapes, following a program to locate the newly-arrived astronaut. The Planetary Army becomes suspicious after Rover's escape and begins to investigate. At a barbecue, the mysterious spacecraft touches down in the backyard; and NASA Astronaut Charles ""Chuck"" Baker  emerges. As Chuck plants the U.S. flag, he steps on a ""rubber ducky"" someone left on the ground. Everyone stares, and Chuck tries to get back into his module; but Eckle is in his way, eager for an autograph. Shocked when he realizes he is on an inhabited planet, Chuck runs about wildly and hides at the planetarium as the Army arrives on the scene. Planetary Army General Grawl  consults Professor Kipple  about the ""alien invader."" The Army quarantines the area and asks citizens start a local ""civil defense"" force to prevent the citizens from becoming ""zombies."" At the planetarium, Lem discovers Chuck's hiding-place, and both are surprised to discover they speak the same language. Realizing this alien is no threat, Lem decides to help Chuck, hiding him in his bedroom for the night. Rover finds Chuck, who is very happy to see it. As the General and his men search Lem's room, the group sneaks back into the planetarium with Chuck, who tells Lem he has ""the right stuff"". Chuck also shows Lem the star that Earth orbits and how the universe is much bigger than Lem had thought, which was that there were 1,000 stars in a universe 500 miles long. The next morning, the Army takes Chuck's module to a secret location. Lem and Skiff get an idea. The next night is the première of a new ""Humaniacs"" movie; and Lem, Skiff, and Chuck attend in costumes as fans. Chuck introduces some new music as part of the contest and teaches Lem to dance. Things go well until Rover arrives: chaos ensues. General Grawl arrives and points out Chuck's United States Flag insignia is a dead giveaway that he isn't a ""local"". Chuck is captured and unmasked. When Lem tries to keep him from being taken away, General Grawl labels Lem a zombie, and Professor Kipple announces he will dissect both their brains. To protect Lem, Chuck pretends to ""release"" him from his control. Lem is proclaimed a hero, and Chuck and Rover are locked into armored vehicles and taken away. At Base 9, General Grawl interrogates Chuck, and an accidental gunshot starts a complicated chain reaction with soldiers shooting at each other. General Grawl thinks Chuck is resisting his demands and allows Professor Kipple to have a go at dissecting Chuck's brain. Lem gets his job back at the planetarium and is permitted to speak about the incident on TV, but he cannot truly accept the honor. He feels terrible about Chuck and decides to do the right thing. While he's hot-wiring a car, Neera, Skiff, and Eckle join him to go off to rescue Chuck. The teens know luck is on their side when Rover shows up on the edge of town—he unscrewed the bolts holding together the armored vehicle in which he was imprisoned. Rover sniffs out Chuck's trail and leads them to an abandoned gas station in the desert. They look around, and Skiff sees a Coca-Cola bottle in an old refrigerator. When he tries to take it, it opens up the entrance to Base 9. Lem has Glar distract the soldiers guarding the base with his protest group while the rest of them sneak into the base. They find Chuck strapped to a laboratory table, and Professor Kipple is cheerfully getting ready to remove his brain. Lem and his friends break in through the ceiling while Rover scares away the scientists, technicians, and guards. They release Chuck but set off alarms. Rover helps the group find Chuck's spacecraft, which was in a hangar; but General Grawl warns that, if the ""alien"" tries to leave, the hangar will blow up. The ""alien"" does try to leave; and, in the resulting firestorm, the General is knocked unconscious, and most of the soldiers flee. The teenagers and Rover get into the module, but Chuck rescues the General from the fire. Chuck pilots the ship into orbit around the planet, allowing the teens to experience outer space. Skiff and Eckle enjoy the weightlessness; General Grawl realizes Chuck hasn't turned him into a zombie; and Lem asks Neera out on a date. Chuck pilots the module back to the planet's surface; and, although the soldiers are ready to shoot anyone who appears, the General stops them. Finally, the inhabitants of Planet 51 see that Chuck came to their planet for peaceful purposes. Chuck lets Rover stay with Skiff and says his farewells to Planet 51. Chuck then leaves Planet 51 peacefully, accompanied by the pet dog that is owned by a female alien seen throughout the film (Xenomorph [[Alien , which had sneaked aboard his ship.

Lehiff's nemesis, Garda Detective Jerry Lynch  presents himself as a saviour who fights the ""scumbags"" on Dublin's streets, and enlists the help of Ben Campion , an ambitious film-maker and the bane of his ""go-softer"" boss, who considers Lynch too nasty a subject to be shown on a mainstream “docusoap” series on Irish terrestrial TV. While shooting a scene about a traffic accident, Ben is told to focus his attention on Sally , Deirdre's sister, who helped the passengers after the double-decker bus they were on crashed on its side. Sally, who is deeply insecure about her looks, grows bitter when Deirdre flaunts her new boyfriend, Sam , a middle-aged bank manager who has left his wife of 14 years, Noeleen , leaving her to question her own self-worth as a woman and wife. John, Deirdre's ex-boyfriend, is utterly lost without her and is determined to do anything to win her back. Thus, he gets involved in an absurd plan along with Mick , the driver of the bus that crashed, and Lehiff. They kidnap Sam and force him to go to his bank to get some money so that they can demand a ransom. Things go awry when Sam, who has the money, is assaulted by an enraged Noeleen on the street and a couple of police officers appear. Mick and John flee the scene without their money. Mick becomes obsessed with taking revenge on Philip , the boy who had lobbed the stone into the windshield and made him swerve and crash the bus, which resulted in Mick getting fired. Things do not go quite his way, and he ends up learning a bitter lesson. As for Lehiff, Lynch corners him in an open field, and the scene is set for a confrontation that ends in an unexpected way.

A pizza delivery man who witnesses the incident is also shot by the killer and is left in a coma. The following morning, a young woman is killed by a Washington Metro train in an apparent suicide. Congressman Stephen Collins  of Pennsylvania is distraught to hear the news, he claims because the woman was Sonia Baker , a lead researcher on his staff. Collins, who has military experience, is leading an investigation into PointCorp, a private defense contractor with controversial operations involving mercenaries. Collins tells his old friend Cal McAffrey , an investigative reporter, that he had been having an affair with Sonia and that she had sent him a cheerful video message on the morning of her death, which he says is inconsistent and unusual behavior for someone about to commit suicide. Della Frye , a reporter and blogger with the online division of Cal's newspaper and its editor, Cameron Lynne , discover that Sonia's death occurred in one of only three CCTV blind spots in the Metro camera system. Cal believes the shootings are related to Sonia's death and finds a link between the petty thief and a homeless girl who sought out Cal. The homeless girl gives him photographs that the thief, a friend of hers, had stolen from the killer's briefcase. The photos show surveillance images of Sonia talking to a well-dressed man. Della visits the hospital where the pizza delivery man is regaining consciousness. While at his room she witnesses the pizza delivery man shot dead by an unseen sniper. Later, she reviews CCTV footage and recognizes a man she saw at the hospital. It is revealed that PointCorp stands to gain 40&nbsp;billion annually from its mercenary activities in the Middle East and domestically. Cal speaks with Collins, who shares his research findings &mdash; PointCorp is cooperating with other defense contractors to create a monopoly and purchase government surveillance and defense contracts, essentially privatizing United States security from the government. Cal's PointCorp insider returns with the address of someone linked to the suspected assassin. Cal finds the assassin living there and calls the police, who force the man to disappear after he shoots at Cal. Della, following a close lead, finds the identity of the well-dressed man who was speaking to Sonia in the listed photographs. He is Dominic Foy , a PR executive working for a subsidiary of PointCorp. Cal blackmails him into talking about his activities with Sonia and secretly tapes their conversation. The PR executive reveals that Sonia was actually paid to spy on Collins and seduce him to get informations for PointCorp, but then she fell in love with Collins and she was already pregnant with his child when she was killed. Before Cal's newspaper goes to press, Collins goes on record to present his research into PointCorp. Collins' wife Anne ([[Robin Wright  reveals that she knows the amount of money Sonia received from PointCorp, after just hearing Collins' statement to the newspaper. After the couple leaves, Cal realizes that Collins knew already that Sonia was working for PointCorp. Cal then wonders what Collins would have done had he known he had been tricked and whether Collins himself is connected with Sonia's assassin. A picture of Collins from his military days, with the assassin in the frame, confirms Cal's hunch. Collins reveals that he had been suspicious of Sonia, and that he hired the assassin to watch her. The assassin is U.S. Army Corporal Robert Bingham , whose life Collins had once saved. Collins says that Bingham hated PointCorp more than he did and he killed Sonia with no authorization from him. Cal tells Collins that he has three minutes to leave his office before the police arrive, as he has already contacted them. As he leaves the building, Cal is confronted by Bingham. Officers arrive and shoot Bingham before he opens fire. Cal leaves and goes to his office. There, Cal and Della type up their own story, noting that Collins was secured and arrested.corruption assassination detective journalist assassin newspaper congress editor-in-chief conspiracy of murder politics election campaign government murder blog based on tv series reporter investigative journalism",False,tt0473705,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,87784194,1,0,0.46306990000000003,39.7198236153607,,,71410199.58695652,109094982.19565217,87713670.8888889,113422856.07407407,188128520.66666666,9,279128520.6666667,3.0,152210844.5,11.0,173210844.5,2.0,,0.0,,,56469409.666666664,28.0,84102743.0,6.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,117272489.0,13.0,154272489.0,3.0,,0.0,,,,,,42027970.0,48027970.0,1.0,,,,,,,59498766.8,79898766.8,5.0,28494998.0,53619998.0,8.0,42027970.0,48027970.0,1.0,,,,19037792.363636363,59401428.72727273,11.0,72614312.4,106214312.4,5.0,80685228.04347827,109853054.13043478,23.0,,,,42027970.0,48027970.0,1.0,47413040.0,93163040.0,2.0,,,,819558444.0,1004558444.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,1109095.0,4109095.0,1.0,,,,2315140.0,50315140.0,1.0,,,,12298192.0,167298192.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,172678649.2916667,128520315.95833333,7.625,3.5,151278235.71911615

A driverless carriage takes them to the castle where they find a dining table set for four people and their bags unpacked in the bedrooms. A servant named Klove explains that his master, the late Count Dracula, ordered that the castle should always be ready to welcome strangers. After dinner the Kents settle in their rooms. Later that night, Alan investigates a noise and follows Klove to the crypt where he is killed by Klove and his blood is mixed with Dracula's ashes, reviving Dracula. Klove entices Helen to the crypt where she becomes Dracula's first victim. The next morning Charles and Diana can find no trace of Alan, Helen or Klove. Charles takes Diana to a woodsman’s hut and then he returns to the castle to search for Alan and Helen. Klove tricks Diana into returning to the castle. Charles finds Alan’s dismembered body in a trunk in the crypt. It is now dark and Dracula rises. Diana meets Helen, but Helen has become one of the undead and she attacks Diana. Dracula enters and warns her away from Diana. Charles struggles with Dracula until Diana realises her crucifix is an effective weapon against vampires. Charles improvises a larger cross and drives Dracula away. They escape the castle in a carriage, but lose control on the steep roads. The carriage crashes and Diana is unconscious. Charles carries her for several hours through the woods until they are rescued by Father Sandor, who takes them to his abbey. While waiting for Diana to awaken, Sandor tells Charles about Dracula. Klove arrives at the monastery in a wagon carrying two coffins bearing Dracula and Helen. Klove is denied admission by the monks. Ludwig, a patient at the abbey, is in thrall to Dracula and invites the vampire inside. Helen convinces Diana to open the window for her, claiming that Dracula is controlling her. Diana does, and Helen bites her arm. Dracula drags Helen off as he wants Diana for himself. Charles bursts into the room and drives the vampires out. Sandor sterilises the bite with the heat from an oil lamp. Sandor puts silver crucifixes in the two coffins to prevent the vampires returning to them. Helen is captured and staked. Sandor tells Charles that the Helen he knew is dead and that her current form is nothing but a monster now. Ludwig then lures Diana into Dracula’s presence, where she is hypnotised into removing her crucifix. Dracula coerces her to drink his blood from his bare chest, but Charles returns in time to prevent it, forcing Dracula to flee with the unconscious Diana. Charles and Sandor arm themselves and follow on horseback. A shortcut allows them to get in front of Dracula's wagon and stop it. Charles shoots Klove but the horses gallop off to the castle. Dracula's coffin is thrown onto the icy moat and Charles attempts to stake the vampire but is beaten back. Shots fired by Sandor break the ice and Dracula sinks into the freezing water and perishes.castle vampire sequel blood gothic horror cult film crucifix hammer horror carpathians dracula",False,tt0059127,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,364937,0,0,0.3015846407897881,3.101963739380412,,,7250000.0,9250000.0,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,67397661.21196608

Speaking in a perfect American English accent, she tells her customers her name is Jennifer David and a native of San Francisco. Her conservative father Rajeev  is unhappy that she is so eager to forsake her own culture for another, but will be pleased when she goes through with her arranged marriage to wealthy but childishly dull Vikram. Priya, posing as Jennifer David, happens to call the handsome and charming Granger Woodruff  to help him with the fraudulent charges on his credit card. Priya and Granger have an instant connection over the phone. Unable to suppress the intrigue their easy chemistry offers, Priya agrees to meet Granger in San Francisco. When Priya goes to the meeting place, he doesn't recognize her. As she is attempting to check out of the hotel, they stumble into each other and finally meet, but Priya does not tell him that she is Jennifer. They immediately hit it off and he invites her out to dinner. Priya and Granger's relationship blossoms as they share a wonderfully romantic date the following day. They tour the City by the Bay by cable car, sample some especially spicy curry , and nearly—but not quite—kiss with the Golden Gate Bridge as a backdrop. Improbably, they are falling in love. However, Priya's family has arrived to bring their wayward daughter home a la Coming to America and elude the shame of her escapades. Granger struggles with himself mentally for having abandoned Jennifer David for Priya instead, but still doesn't know that the Priya and Jennifer are the same person. Meanwhile, both lovers wonder if they just might be too different for their love to actually be possible. Eventually, Priya and Granger are found out by her parents and he learns that Priya is actually Jennifer David, and also that she is engaged to Vikram. He is angry that she deceived him, and painfully decides to cut their ties. All of Priya's family is happy for the relationship to have ended, except for her 80 year-old Aunt who advises her that life is too short to live to make only others happy. Priya goes to Granger's hotel to fight for their love but is shattered when she finds his previous girlfriend Emory in the hotel room with him. She is extremely upset that he could forget about her so easily, and he lets her leave and walk out of his life as if forever. Back in India, Priya can't bring herself to accept a lackluster life with Vikram. As she struggles to gently disengage without hurting her family, announcing to her betrothed's family that she must develop as a person, her once-future father in law calls her a rude name. Amazingly, her father forcefully stands up for her, points out that whenever she enters a room, people smile, and that he loves her. Granger, too, feels something is missing. While giving the traditional Best Man's Toast at a wedding, he quotes the groom, his childhood best friend: ""Nothing should ever hold a man back from his future."" Shocked speechless before finishing the toast, he realizes what he may still be able to save. He rushes to the airport, furiously calling the bank in Mumbai with the help of a Hindi-speaking cab driver. Priya has thrown herself back into her work, accepting a promotion to help her coworkers become as effective as she is channeling American attitudes and accent. Just as she is counseling a young man to control his emotions to better serve the bank and its customers, Granger strides into Priya's call center and cautiously declares his devotion. With a hundred eyes on the couple, a coworker coaxes, ""Kiss him! Kiss him!"" They kiss for the first time to the cheers of her crew. After her shift, as morning breaks, the apprehensive couple finds her family enjoying an open-air breakfast in their sun-dappled garden. Granger bravely attempts to win the approval of Priya's father by promising to honor her and her culture in phonetic but crude Hindi. Granger formally repeats his commitment to respect and care for her. Father thinks it over for a few moments as the family watches him intently, and he graciously accepts the young man, welcoming him to breakfast.indian lead call center romantic comedy",False,tt1049405,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,115592,0,0,-120.11564814173992,-1.6278585820155915,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,95612307.5388973

Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as ""Captain Lescovar"" . To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with ""Force 10"", an American sabotage unit, led by Lt. Col. Barnsby , which has its own mission there. To maximize security, Force 10 steals a plane from Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by American MPs before they can take off. Weaver , a U.S. Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully ""escape"" Termoli only to be shot down by Luftwaffe night fighters. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Reynolds  manage to escape the crippled plane. On the ground, the survivors run across a group they believe to be their allies, Communist Yugoslav Partisans. Led by Capt. Drazak , Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks  under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission. Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder ([[Michael Byrne , that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a new drug called ""penicillin"". By the next morning, the prisoners are told that Schroeder has opened the case, finding it full of firewood. Mallory and Barnsby improvise, ""admitting"" they buried the samples. Schroeder sends them to retrieve them, under the guard of his concubine Maritza  and three of his soldiers. Miller, Weaver, and Reynolds are left in a cell in camp. Far from camp, Maritza kills the Germans, revealing herself to be a partisan spy. She directs Mallory and Barnsby towards the partisans under the command of her father, Major Petrovich . Mallory and Barnsby escape, ambushing and killing two of Drazak's Chetniks, who are bandaged to hide burns from flamethrowers. Eventually, the two meet a patrol of real Yugoslav Partisans led by a man Mallory recognizes his target – Captain Lescovar alias Nicolai. While Mallory assumes that Lescovar has recognized him, too, he and Barnsby are nevertheless taken to the partisans. Mallory and Barnsby realize where they are when they recognize a wide river and a large hydroelectric dam near the Partisan camp. Skeptical, Major Petrovich dismisses Mallory's story about Lescovar being Nicolai, assuring Mallory they executed the real Nicolai months earlier. He reproves the men for killing the bandaged Chetniks, as the men were partisan infiltrators and his only link to his daughter Maritza. Major Petrovich's principal worry is an impending assault by the Wehrmacht. The Germans are marshaling their forces nearby, and only a ravine separates as many as three German divisions from the outnumbered partisans. Only a single concrete arch bridge links each side of the ravine, but the partisans have been unable to destroy it. Convinced that no bridge is impregnable, Barnsby reveals that this bridge is, in fact, Force 10's target. Knowing Miller's expertise in demolitions, Mallory convinces a reluctant Petrovich to help mount a rescue mission using Lescovar and the Partisan Marko . The four re-enter the camp at night, Mallory and Barnsby posing as captives and the partisans disguised as the bandaged men. Before they complete their mission, Drazak arrives with the bodies of the real bandaged men and, since Maritza had always been seen with them, concludes she was a partisan as well. A gun battle breaks out in the cell block. Major Schroeder and Force 10's Reynolds are killed; but Mallory, Barnsby, Miller, Weaver, Lescovar and Marko escape in a truck with a badly beaten Maritza and the recovered explosives. Having made it to the Partisans, explosives expert Miller reveals that the bridge really is impregnable. Mallory hits upon the idea of destroying the upstream dam they saw earlier, with the sudden onrush of several millions of gallons of water being enough to destroy the bridge. A night-time air drop is arranged to replace Force 10's lost supplies, but Lescovar sabotages the drop by calling in German planes. Maritza spots Lescovar betraying the partisans, but he kills her before she can warn the others. German planes bomb the illuminated drop zone. Major Petrovich, angered by the botched air drop, orders the men to be sent to Marshal Josip Broz Tito's headquarters for transport back to Italy. The team decides to infiltrate the German marshaling yards at Mostar to steal explosives, taking Lescovar and Marko. Lescovar again betrays them, alerting a German sergeant to their presence, identifying himself as an Abwehr officer. Marko overhears the plan and sacrifices himself to save the others. The others escape, with Lescovar, aboard a train leaving for Sarajevo. Lescovar's hasty cover story doesn't fool Mallory or Barnsby—Barnsby had observed Lescovar's interactions with the German sergeant, who, fatally, salutes him even though Lescovar's uniform made him out to be a corporal; Mallory had noticed a map showing that their train passes within a half-mile of the dam - a fact Lescovar ""neglected"" to bring up. Though Lescovar denies treachery, Mallory is convinced and Barnsby kills him. Jumping the train near the dam, the team splits up: Miller and Weaver set off diversionary explosives while Mallory and Barnsby sneak into the dam. Weaver runs into Capt. Drazak in the woods and kills him after a knife fight. Mallory and Barnsby set their charges within the dam but realize that they are out of time. With the German assault only minutes away - they are forced to set a short fuse, leaving them no time to escape. Mallory and Barnsby are caught in the explosion, yet nevertheless survive. At first, the dam appears undamaged, but soon it begins to disintegrate. With its fragile structural integrity disrupted, the dam wall collapses, releasing millions of tons of water in a wave that topples the real target, the impregnable bridge. The German assault is thwarted, saving the Partisans. Mallory and Barnsby rejoin Miller and Weaver, but the jubilation is short-lived. Mallory reminds the men that they're now trapped on the wrong side of the river, with no supplies and no way of contacting or reaching the partisans. As the credits roll, the men begin a strenuous journey back to friendly lines.gun traitor nazi bridge major colonel sergeant battle partisan task force",False,tt0077572,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,7230000,0,0,0.446,15.1328345263288,21036762.90909091,25818581.09090909,,,,,34782921.666666664,15,38416255.0,3.0,,0.0,,,171438673.0,1.0,185438673.0,1.0,28750000.0,1.0,50750000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,171438673.0,1.0,185438673.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,15583333.333333334,21183333.333333332,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,119137611.25,125062611.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90572000.0,97572000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17700000.0,22450000.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,7925000.0,15725000.0,2.0,,,,,,,22900000.0,28900000.0,115010900.25,101602566.91666667,2.25,1.5,68011965.11413558

Sam oversees automated harvesters and launches canisters bound for Earth containing the helium-3 they extract. Chronic communication problems limit him to occasional recorded messages with his wife Tess, who was pregnant with their daughter Eve when he left. His only companion is an artificial intelligence assistant named GERTY, who assists with the base's automation. Two weeks before he is to return to Earth, Sam suffers from hallucinations of a teenage girl. One such hallucination distracts him while he is out recovering a helium-3 canister from a harvester, causing him to crash his rover into the harvester. Rapidly losing air, Sam dons his helmet in time, but still loses consciousness from his injuries. Sam awakes in the base infirmary, but with no memory of the accident. He overhears GERTY receiving instructions from Lunar Industries not to let him outside the base and to wait for the arrival of rescue team ""Eliza"". He manufactures a fake problem with the base to force GERTY to let him outside. Inside the crashed rover he finds another, unconscious Sam Bell. After bringing this Sam back to the base and tending to his injuries, the two Sams start to wonder if one is a clone of the other. They get into a heated argument and physical altercation, but soon work together to coerce GERTY into revealing that in fact they are both clones of the real Sam Bell, who is on Earth. GERTY had awakened a new clone after the rover crash and implanted the memories of the real Sam Bell, believing that the original clone could not be recovered. The two clones start exploring the base. They find out that communications are being jammed by antennae at the far edges of the base, and that previous clones have all started to deteriorate and become very ill after about three years of being revived -- upon which, believing they were being put into hibernation for the journey home, were simply incinerated. They also discover an enormous vault containing hundreds more clones below the base. The older Sam drives past the interference range in another rover and calls Tess on Earth, only to get Eve, now 15 years old, who informs him that Tess had died years before. He hangs up before the real Sam can answer. The Sams realise that the incoming rescue team will kill them both if they are found together. The newer Sam suggests sending the other to Earth in one of the helium-3 canisters, but the older Sam, already in an advanced state of deterioration, knows he will not live much longer and instead suggests the newer Sam go and alert the public to what Lunar Industries is doing. The older Sam plans to return to the crashed rover and die there, so Lunar Industries will not suspect anything. They work with GERTY to erase all records of the second clone, and then revive a third clone to await the Eliza rescue team. They also program one of the harvesters to crash into a jamming antenna to enable communication with Earth. The older Sam, back in the rover, watches as the canister taking the other Sam is launched to Earth, before blacking out. As the credits roll, news broadcasts report that the clone's testimony about Lunar Industries' illegal activities stirred considerable controversy on Earth, causing the company's stock to crash.moon artificial intelligence clone isolation future dystopia space cloning moon base",False,tt1182345,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,9760104,1,0,0.9520208,39.7198236153607,,,,,,,19595104.5,4,59595104.5,2.0,-8145449.333333333,8.0,32521217.333333332,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-17982197.0,2.0,32017803.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,18494642.0,71994642.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-33326758.0,26673242.0,1.0,-11502621.0,12497379.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,1818479.0,7818479.0,1.0,21402809.666666668,32069476.333333332,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41378041.61111111,-2177513.9444444445,1.75,2.0,151278235.71911615

They have a daughter, Abigail . Lisa frequently travels to Milan to do business with the Gianni & Gianni Company. The story then moves forward an unspecified amount of time, where Lisa has died. Peter is rooting around his house, in an attempt to rid himself of Lisa's stuff, to help deal with the grief. Abigail takes one of her mother's shoes and pulls a piece of paper out of it, saying it was for Peter to find. On the paper is written ""Lake Como"". Soon after this, Peter finds a strange message on her cell phone from a man, wishing only to hear Lisa's voice. It creates a tension in the mind of Peter and he decides to check her e-mails and finds several similar requests in there too. He also finds a secret folder named “Love” on her Desktop which is password protected. It creates a strong suspicion in his mind that she had a secret love affair and that her lover is mailing her now. He tries to open the folder by breaking the password for several days, but in vain. He replies to the mails of “Ralph” pretending to be Lisa. He requests one of his trusted co-workers to find out the real name & exact location of the sender of these e-mails by tracing down his IP Address, through his email address, which is an offence. His co-worker tells him that Rafe’s real name is Ralph , who lives in Milan. Peter continues to try to access the ""love"" folder on Lisa's computer, and becomes increasingly frustrated. In anger he types ""Lake Como"" and when he applies that as the password, the folder opens. It contains thousands of her photos & videos with Ralph in their passionate moments & near “Lake Como” where she first met Ralph. In order to find out more about his wife's lover, he secretly locates and follows Ralph in Milan. He then goes to a Milanese Cafe, one of Ralph's haunts, and begins to play chess alone. Ralph engages him in conversation, and they begin to play chess and talk. Ralph easily speaks about Lisa & their relationship, unaware that Peter is Lisa's husband. Ralph tells him that it is he who has suggested she start a Shoe designing business after perceiving her unique understanding of shoes and her passion towards different new designs, which this industry lacks. Over a period of time, they play several games of chess and, as far as Ralph is concerned, have a friendship. Abigail learns of her mother's affair, while listening to her mother's voicemail, and deduces her father's frightening obsession with vengeance. She goes to Milan and tries to convince her father to stop hunting for Lisa’s lover as she had already gone, as well as to accept her husband George . She also warns him that his craziness will lead him to lose everything . Peter becomes greatly upset and he goes uninvited, with murderous intent, to Ralph's apartment. There, to his surprise, he learns that Ralph is not the cosmopolitan man of the world as he has been portraying himself, but an impoverished janitor. Peter's hate diminishes, but not his urge to avenge. He sends an e-mail, as Lisa, to Ralph, asking that he meet her at Lake Como. Ralph tells Peter about his upcoming meeting, and Peter gives him money to enable the meeting. Ralph also plans to throw a party for Lisa in London, as he sees this latest meeting as a sign that their relationship is taking off. Ralph goes to Lake Como, but instead of finding Lisa there, Ralph finds Peter waiting for him, and Peter reveals to Ralph that he was Lisa's husband, and that Lisa is actually dead. Ralph tells Peter that Lisa had known about his humble origins and poor socio-economic background. She also helped him financially on several occasions. He also forces Peter to confront that it is his excessive devotion for his work & cold nature towards marital life, which had moved Lisa to seek warmth in Ralph's arms, but still loving Peter so much that she never was ready to leave him, in spite of cheating with Ralph. Throughout this conversation, it is shown through flashbacks that Lisa died of cancer, and that she did not tell Peter about it until 'it was too late'. It is then revealed that, when Lisa was about to die due to critical illness, she wrote something on a piece of paper and asked her daughter to put it in her red shoes so that one day Peter would find it. But Lisa instructs Abigail not to tell him about the letter. Abigail asks how he would find the message when he doesn't even know about its existence, but she replies that he will definitely look for it and find it on his own one day. This is the piece of paper with ""Lake Como"" on it from earlier. When Ralph asks her to tell Peter about their affair, end their marriage and move in with him, Lisa refused, saying that she did not want to hurt Peter and make him endure the pain of separation. She promised to reveal her dark secret to Peter at the appropriate time in her life so that he can forgive her for her infidelity. Peter and Ralph part, with Peter seemingly more bitter and angry than ever. Ralph has arranged a dinner in Lisa's memory, and at first, Peter refuses to go. However, he realizes that “forgiveness and love need to replace hate”, and arranges to be at the dinner with Abigail and her husband. Traveling home after the dinner, we see Peter reconciled with George, Abigail's husband.woman between two men betrayal",False,tt0974613,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1143856,0,0,-12.113538767117536,-1.6278585820155915,,,10062514.5,35062514.5,,,54688515.81818182,25,107733970.36363636,11.0,,0.0,,,63017256.0,8.0,96350589.33333333,3.0,25951540.25,4.0,44701540.25,4.0,,0.0,,,-23833093.5,6.0,39166906.5,2.0,78426867.5,15.0,104926867.5,2.0,-15043555.0,1.0,7156445.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17275191.5,27525191.5,2.0,,,,42936443.5,57103110.166666664,6.0,,,,,,,,,,17409085.333333332,35409085.333333336,3.0,108384128.0,123384128.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,80479.0,5580479.0,1.0,,,,142819207.5,166694207.5,4.0,,,,,,,,,,182680148.33333334,208680148.33333334,3.0,,,,,,,,,66672719.82449495,30534588.511363637,7.375,4.0,95612307.5388973

At the same time a sumptuous banquet is held for them, the orphan boys who work there are being served their daily gruel. They dream of enjoying the same ""Food, Glorious Food"" as their masters. While eating, some boys draw straws to see who will ask for more to eat, and the job falls to a boy named Oliver Twist. He goes up to Mr. Bumble and Widow Corney, who run the workhouse and serve the gruel, and quietly asks, ""Please, sir, I want some more."" Mr. Bumble is enraged and Oliver is taken to the governors to see what to do with him . A decision is made to have Oliver be sold into service. Mr. Bumble parades Oliver through the snow trying to sell him to the highest bidder . Oliver is eventually sold to an undertaker named Mr. Sowerberry, who intends to use him as a mourner for children's funerals. After his first funeral, Noah Claypole, Sowerberry's apprentice, insults Oliver's mother to get a rise out of him. Oliver attacks Noah and Mrs. Sowerberry forces him into a coffin while Noah fetches Mr. Bumble. Oliver is too angry to be intimidated by Mr. Bumble and Bumble places the blame on not keeping Oliver on a diet of gruel. Oliver is thrown into the cellar as further punishment. Alone in the dark with a roomful of empty coffins, Oliver tearfully wonders ""Where is Love?"". While clutching the window grate, Oliver inadvertently pushes it open and he escapes. After a week on the road, Oliver reaches London, where he plans to seek his fortune. Shortly after arriving, he crosses paths with the Artful Dodger, a young thief who decides to take Oliver under his wing . Dodger leads Oliver to his home, a hideout for a group of young pickpockets run by the criminal Fagin. Oliver naively believes the handkerchiefs and wallets they've stolen are ""made"" by them and Fagin and the boys play along for their amusement. He then helps the boys practice their stealing while reiterating his belief that ""You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two"" to get by. Once the boys go to sleep, Fagin sneaks off to meet with Bill Sikes, a dangerous thief with whom he makes his deals. Sikes' girlfriend, Nancy, waits for him at the pub and sings of her contentment with the life she shares with the reprobates of London while covering up her own broken dreams of the life she wishes she had with Sikes . Back at the hideout, Oliver witnesses Fagin counting his hidden treasures and taking a little more than his fair share from Sikes' loot. While initially furious that he's been discovered, Fagin halfheartedly admits that he's keeping his ""pretty things"" for comfort in his old age. Nancy and her best friend Bet arrive in the morning to collect some money from Fagin on behalf of Sikes, and meet Oliver. The boys mock Oliver for his politeness towards Nancy, which she finds charming. Dodger attempts to be just as gentlemanly towards Nancy and the boys and Fagin join in the fun . Fagin sends the boys out for the day and Oliver asks to go with Dodger, which he agrees to ""Be Back Soon"". While on the job, however, Oliver witnesses what Dodger really does and is blamed for Dodger's theft of a wallet belonging to a gentleman named Mr. Brownlow. Oliver is chased by the police, and despite Dodger's best efforts to stall them, is arrested. Afraid that Oliver will tell the police all about them, Fagin and Sikes send Nancy to court to watch what he does. Oliver is too terrified to say anything, but before the magistrate can finalize the verdict, a bookseller who witnessed the act arrives to prove Oliver's innocence. Mr. Brownlow takes in Oliver and Sikes and Fagin send Dodger to follow them.  Oliver has been living in the wealthy residence of Mr. Brownlow for several weeks now. From the balcony he watches the merchants and other folk of London sell their wares  Sikes has been keeping an eye on Oliver, firmly believing he may tell on them. He and Fagin are determined to get him back and employ Nancy to help them as Oliver trusts her more than he does the others. Nancy refuses as she wants Oliver to have a life free of thievery but Sikes cruelly hits her. As Nancy reluctantly follows Sikes, she sings of her unwavering love of him despite his ways . The next day, Mr. Brownlow entrusts Oliver with some books and money to be delivered to the bookshop. As he leaves, Brownlow notices a striking resemblance between a portrait of his long-lost niece and Oliver. While walking through the streets of London, Oliver is sidetracked by Nancy and is eventually kidnapped by Sikes and taken back to the hideout. Sikes and Nancy argue but she leaves as he starts to get violent in front of the boys again. Fagin begins reconsidering his life as a thief and weighs all his options, but decides to keep to his old ways by ""Reviewing the Situation"". Mr. Bumble and Widow Corney pay a visit to Mr. Brownlow after he begins searching for Oliver's origin. They present a locket belonging to Oliver's mother, who arrived at the workhouse penniless and died in childbirth. Mr. Brownlow recognizes the locket as his niece's and throws the two out, enraged that they chose to selfishly keep the trinket and information to themselves until they could collect a reward for it. Meanwhile, in an attempt to introduce Oliver to a life of crime, Sikes forces Oliver to take part in a house robbery. The robbery fails when Oliver accidentally awakens the people living in the house, but he and Sikes manage to get away. While Sikes and Oliver are gone, Nancy, fearful that Sikes will kill Oliver, goes to Brownlow, confessing her part in Oliver's kidnapping and promising to return him to Mr. Brownlow the next evening at London Bridge; however, she insists that Brownlow come alone, her loyalty to Sikes prevents her from turning him over to the police. Then she goes to her job at the tavern. When Sikes and Oliver show up safely there, Sikes orders his dog Bullseye to guard the boy. Nancy starts up a lively drinking song, hoping that the noise will distract Sikes . Bullseye, however, alerts him and he secretly follows Nancy and Oliver despite Fagin's pleads not to hurt Nancy. As Oliver and Nancy share a farewell embrace at London Bridge, Sikes catches up, grabs Nancy, and bludgeons her to death, mistakenly believing that she did betray him after all. He then kidnaps Oliver, but Bullseye returns to the scene of the crime after Sikes tries to murder him as well to prevent detection. The dog leads Brownlow and an angry mob to the thieves' hideout. Sikes uses Oliver as a hostage to make sure he gets away unscathed. Fagin loses his grip on his box of treasures while running and they sink deep into the mud. After forcing Oliver to loop a rope around a rooftop plank so that he  can escape, Sikes is shot dead by the police as he tries to swing across from one rooftop to another. Oliver is reunited with Mr. Brownlow and Fagin makes up his mind to change his ways for good. Just as he's about to walk away a new man, Dodger approaches him with a wallet he stole earlier. They dance off into the sunrise together, happily determined to live out the rest of their days as thieves (""Reviewing the Situation  while Oliver returns home for good .london, england based on novel or book pickpocket musical song orphanage victorian england based on play or musical orphan dog 19th century",False,tt0063385,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,37402877,0,0,2.7402877,17.51149136225447,,,-953079.0,46921.0,25328598.0,30668598.0,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11748460.5,14198460.5,2.0,77926874.0,90926874.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,62654181.5,70104181.5,2.0,60101249.333333336,70067916.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,15075000.0,19075000.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,63643507.60930695

The spirit responds, but Jim, formerly Brandon's best friend and now nemesis, insults David, making David angry and provoking David to slash the tires of Brandon's car. The next day, Linda, Jim's live-in girlfriend, sees Brandon's ouija board  and tries to contact David. The spirit that appears is actually an evil being  acting under the guise of David. This malicious spirit starts being nice and helpful, informing Linda where her lost diamond engagement ring is. Meanwhile, at the construction site where Jim is working, Jim's friend Lloyd gets killed by the murderous spirit. Linda again contacts Malfeitor—whom she still believes to be David—and he lies, responding that he did not cause the accident. Linda begins to fall under ""progressive entrapment"", in which the spirit changes and starts to terrorize the user, making the person weak and easy to possess. Brandon and Jim conduct research on David, and later accuse him of terrorizing Linda. They play with the Ouija board and discover that another spirit is frightening Linda. The same spirit then attacks and kills Brandon. Released from the hospital, Linda plays with the board but gets no response. She then takes a shower, but gets attacked by Malfeitor. She initially escapes but soon is possessed by the evil entity. The next morning, Jim returns and discovers the apartment in disarray, with Linda wearing men's formal wear and holding an axe. Just then, Dewhurst, the detective investigating the murders he suspects were perpetrated by Jim , enters the apartment. He accuses Jim of hurting Linda, but quickly discovers that he is wrong as he is immediately gets smacked on the face with a rod, rendering him unconscious and causing him to drop his gun. Jim picks up the gun and shoots the board many times right before Linda pushes him out the window. The next scene is at the church at Jim and Linda's wedding. A child finds the board, shows it to her and says, ""Wonder if it still works?"" She then throws it into the box with the planchette.

The book details the life of the Moon Princess, a woman so beautiful and pure the moon itself blessed her with power, a set of magical pearls. On her wedding day, she receives a unicorn from her husband-to-be, and her father gives him a rare black lion, after which, she reveals the pearls to her family  and her bridegrooms family , who have lived together for years. At the funeral Maria spots a young boy her age, wearing an odd hat, watching her from a distance but when she looks back he has disappeared. It is revealed that Maria's mother died when she was young, and she and her governess, Miss Heliotrope, are sent to live with her uncle, her father's older brother, Sir Benjamin Merryweather who lives at Moonacre Manor. On the journey, they are attacked by bandits, and soon after meet Sir Benjamin, a seemingly bad tempered, irritable man, who tells her almost all of the house is off limits to her and warns her never to go into the woods. He also takes the book from her. As time passes, she begins to notice that her new residence is home to many strange, fantastical events. Food and clothing are left in her room seemingly by magic, a piano plays itself, and even though there is no kitchen, there is always food on the dining room table. Each night a star falls from the sky and a mysterious picture appears outside her room. Each day, her uncle has the picture removed. One day, Maria's uncle takes her horse riding. She spots a rabbit in distress and follows it into the woods in an effort to help it. Bandits find Maria while she is in the forest and pursue her. Maria recognizes them as members of the De Noir family and the same bandits who attacked her on a previous journey. She learns that the leader of the small teenage group is called Robin. She also recalls her uncle's warning concerning the De Noirs. She is saved from the bandits by her uncle's dog, Wrolf, a demonic seeming creature. Robin is revealed to be the son of Coeur De Noir who is the leader of the De Noirs clan. It is also learned that his father is very hard on him, calling him prized dolt for a son after he fails in capturing Maria. After their escape, Maria asks her uncle about the numerous strange events but he shocks her by telling her angrily to stop asking questions. Despite his efforts to hide his tears, Maria notices her uncle crying as he rebukes her. Her uncle tries to leave Maria behind, but Maria chases after her uncle's dog. She stumbles upon the kitchen and finds in it the seemingly magical chef who has been leaving the food in her room and who calls her ""Little Princess"". He tells her of a book that contains all the secret passages at Moonacre, but it is hidden in the library, a place she is forbidden to go. Finding the book again, she discovers that both the Moon Princess' father and her bridegroom were corrupted by the power of the pearls, and betrayed, she cursed them all, proclaiming that one day a ""Pure heart"" would return, and if she is not ""Heard"" by the 5000th moon, the Valley would be plunged into darkness. The moon pearls vanished that day, and Maria realises that the story is true. She asks the chef, who tells her that both families are blinded by pride, and only a true moon princess can break the curse, by returning the pearls to the sea and reuniting the families. He also tells her about a little white horse, invisible to all but a true princess, who would protect her, but she doesn't believe him. She works out she has till the next moon to set things right. The next morning, she attempts to run away, but hears a voice calling to her. Following it, she finds a mysterious woman named Loveday, living in a cave with many animals. Loveday is the person who has been leaving the dresses in her room. She reveals that if the pearls are not returned to the sea, the moons will crash into the valley, killing everyone. She and the woman discuss plans, and Maria is told angrily never to speak of her uncle Benjamin to Loveday. Maria soon realises that each family has one part of the pearls- the Merryweathers have the key and the de Noirs have the casket. Maria finds the key in the bookmark of the Chronicles, and sneaks into the de Noir fortress to retrieve the casket. However, she finds they don't have the pearls, and is imprisoned beneath the fortress. Along the way she manages to kick Robin in-between the legs when he is being rude. She escapes by using her dress as a decoy and is found by her uncle's dog in the woods. After she escaped Coeur De Noir orders her to be killed by saying ""their death is our victory"". His son Robin seems a little put off by this and remarks that ""stupid girl should have stayed where you were"". When Maria returns home her uncle is furious, and refuses to listen to her, but apologies to her later that evening. Loveday appears in her room the next morning, giving her a dress belonging to the first moon princess. Maria persuades her to come downstairs, and the piano plays as if in recognition. Loveday begins to play, and Maria joins her, but soon notices a mirror, showing her Uncle and Loveday dancing to the same music. In the mirror, she reveals to Benjamin that she is a De Noir and Benjamin becomes enraged, believing she tricked him to look for the pearls. Back outside the mirror, Maria talks to Loveday about what she saw, and becoming angered at the pride of both her uncle and Loveday, tells her that Pride is the real curse. Upstairs, looking at the picture, she realizes that it points the way to the pearls. The chef suggests she asks Robin, de Noir's son, and when she refuses points out that she has plenty of pride herself, causing her to think again. When leaving, she gives the servant letters addressed to Loveday and Benjamin, telling them to meet in the house. Trapping Robin, by hanging him from his ankle she makes him promise to listen. After he does she cuts him down and convinces him to help her find the pearls, which are hidden in a tree deep within the forest. As Robin is creating a false trail, Maria notices that he is keeping her ribbon in his pocket, and there is some gentle flirting between them. Meanwhile, Benjamin and Loveday meet, quickly realize what Maria has done, and follow her with Miss Heliotrope, using Chef's superior sense of smell. On the trip, Benjamin and Loveday's relationship slowly begins to repair itself. Robin is captured near the tree, and Wrolf is trapped in a pit. Maria runs, finding the unicorn. De Noir vows to catch her himself, calling his son and daughter  traitors. De Noir finds Maria from the tree and Robin escapes to help her, releasing her from his father, and running to the place where it all began, but Wrolf appears to be injured. After they arrive, soon followed by her Uncle and Loveday, Maria attempts to get Benjamin and de Noir to sacrifice their pride, but neither can do it. Attempting to return the pearls to the sea and failing, she realizes she must sacrifice herself if they are to sacrifice their pride, and throws herself into the ocean. Both families are shocked at this especially Robin. He falls to his knees as he watches her plunge into the water below. The moon accepts her offering, and Maria herself is rescued by a unicorn. Wrolf is restored to life, but as the giant black lion, restoring the magic to Moonacre. A De Noir attempts to kill Maria, but she is saved by Mrs Heliotrope. Benjamin proposes to Loveday again, and she accepts. Mrs Heliotrope is also proposed to by Digweed, Benjamin's servant, and also accepts. They all smile, Maria kisses Robin on the cheak and stare off into the moonlight.

Jimmy is dumped by his girlfriend and Fletch is fired from his job as a clown. They decide to escape their woes and hike to a remote village in Norfolk they find on an old map. As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving. Hoping to find more beautiful women inside, they are greeted by a morose crowd of men and approached by a seemingly crazed vicar  who believes Jimmy is a long lost descendant of a local vampire slayer. As the barman offers the two men free ale as an apology for the vicar, they learn the students they saw earlier are going to a cottage - where they are to stay the night. Jimmy and Fletch pursue the students' bus, catching up to it as the engine has broken down, and are introduced to four girls . They are invited to join a party on the bus. The group arrives at their destination, only to learn that a curse rests over the village and that every female child turns into a lesbian vampire on her eighteenth birthday. There is an old legend stating that the Vampire Queen, Carmilla, descended on the village, killed its menfolk and seduced its women to her evil. When the ruler of the land, Baron Wolfgang Mclaren  returned from the Crusades, he discovered one of the women corrupted by Carmilla was his wife, Eva. The baron forged a sacred sword, then defeated Carmilla, but before dying, Carmilla cursed the village, adding that when the blood of the last of Mclaren's bloodline mixed with a virgin girl's blood, Carmilla would be resurrected. Fletch and Jimmy spend the night with the women. Heidi, Anke and Trudi are turned into vampires. After Lotte insists that the others try to find her missing friends, they witness Trudi being turned. Eva, Carmilla's mistress, tries to draw Lotte to her growing clan of lesbian vampires. The trio runs back into the cottage after killing vampires Heidi and Anke and barricade themselves in after the vampires destroy the bus. Jimmy's ex-girlfriend Judi arrives at the door and Jimmy, not ready to give up on the relationship, takes her into the bedroom. Lotte reveals to Fletch that she is a virgin and wants to sleep with Jimmy. At the church, the Vicar researches the vampire slayer who killed Carmilla before arming himself and setting off to find Jimmy. Judi reveals herself to be a vampire, and after a struggle, Fletch and Jimmy kill her. The vampires approach the cottage and Jimmy inadvertently invites them in. Eva discovers that Jimmy is the descendant of the baron who killed Carmilla and that Lotte is a virgin and kidnaps them. The Vicar saves Fletch from Trudi and tells Fletch the truth about the village and Jimmy's identity. They go after Jimmy and Lotte in the Vicar's crucifix-covered car. As the vampires prepare to sacrifice Lotte and Jimmy, Fletch and the Vicar try to recover the sword of Daeldo, the sword that killed Carmilla, from the baron's tomb.

The result is the death of the driver, which leads to a disagreement with FBI and ATF agents on involvement with the case, which carries on throughout the movie. Then comes Jack Crews , a truck driver who has just been released from jail for vehicular manslaughter, for accidentally hitting and killing a motorist and his passenger on the side of the road during a trip in which he experienced a Black Dog hallucination. Along with his imprisonment, he also loses his commercial driver's license . Following his release, he attempts to get back to a normal life but this time holds a job as a truck mechanic for a local repair shop in New Jersey. He is then offered a job by his manager, Cutler  to drive a load of toilets from Atlanta to New Jersey for 10,000. Crews initially declines the offer, but then finds out that his house will be repossessed unless he pays off his debt. He then changes his mind and takes the job where he flies down to Atlanta to meet up with Red , who runs the trucking yard. Red initially gives Crews a brand-new truck to haul the load, but Crews prefers an older Peterbilt as to not draw too much attention. He is accompanied on the trip by Earl  riding shotgun, and Sonny  and Wes  following in Sonny's Camaro for policy protection. As they make their way to New Jersey, Crews and the guys experience several run-ins with Red and his crew as they attempt to hijack the load, in retaliation for the failed negotiations with Cutler about money. During the trip, Crews finds out that his load also contains illegal guns , and that Wes has been informing Red of their whereabouts throughout the trip. Crews also discovers that Sonny is an FBI agent when he is shot and killed by Red during another hijack attempt, and that the FBI has been tracking their whereabouts as well. Things take a turn for the worse when Cutler takes Crews' wife Melanie and daughter Tracy hostage to ensure that Crews will complete the job and finish the trip. Despite the numerous attempts from Red to hijack the load, as well as the death of Sonny, Crews manages to survive each attempt. When they make it to Maryland, Crews now officially knows what the whole plot is and formulates a plan to turn over the guns to the FBI and to get his family back. Wes at this point has gone his separate way, while Earl decides to stay on until the end. Crews puts the FBI tracking device on the truck that Wes is leaving on and eventually the FBI pulls over the truck to realize it is the wrong one. However, Crews calls Agent Allen Ford  who is leading the case on Wes' cell phone. He tells him his plan which is to meet him at a loading dock in New Jersey, where he will be meeting with Cutler to exchange the guns for his family. Eventually when the meeting occurs, the FBI shows up and a shootout occurs with Cutler's men. Crews is able to catch Cutler before he can escape and then turns him over to the FBI. Then in the end, the FBI gives Crews his CDL license back, and also tells Crews that his house won't be foreclosed, in return for his assistance during the operation and they thank him for bringing Sonny's body back. He is also given the key to drive the truck one last time to the impound lot. Also, Crews thanks Earl, who was wounded in the shootout between the FBI and Cutler's men, for staying, and in return Earl tells Crews to take care of his dog, Tiny , until he heals and everything is sorted out. As Crews and his family leave the docks for the impound lot, he is intercepted by Red who makes one last attempt at Crews' life, but as they are slamming into each other Red loses control of his truck which then flips over numerous times before getting hit by a Fairbanks-Morse H-12-44 Switching Locomotive and exploding.new jersey fbi motorcycle crash truck train crash shootout crash explosion motorcycle ex-con gunrunner truck crash truck chase atf trucker",False,tt0120610,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,12951088,0,0,-1.3164077025806635,-2.5293608277783246,9476976.454545455,30340612.818181816,,,,,-12316079.0,6,14683921.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14683921.0,-12316079.0,0.75,1.0,60772021.118274406

She is brought up under a strict set of rules devised by her mother , the Duchess of Kent and comptroller of the Duchess's household, Sir John Conroy, who calls it the ""Kensington System."" Conroy hopes that William IV will die while Victoria is still a minor, thus the Duchess would be appointed Regent, and he would be the power behind the throne through his considerable control of the Duchess. Victoria grows rebellious and resentful of her mother and Conroy's oppressive control of her every move. During an illness, her mother and Conroy attempt to force Victoria to sign papers that would make Conroy her personal secretary upon her majority. Although weak and ill, Victoria is strong enough to vehemently refuse this ploy, throwing the papers on the floor. Her uncle King Leopold I of Belgium wishes to use his influence through family ties to secure an alliance between Britain and Belgium. He realises his sister, the Duchess, exerts little influence over Victoria and decides to have his nephew Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld seduce Victoria. Albert is trained by Baron Stockmar to learn Victoria's interests, including her favourite novels, music and opera. The Duchess invites the Coburg brothers, Albert and Prince Ernest of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld to visit the household. Victoria and Albert develop an early fondness for each other, despite Victoria knowing that Albert was sent by her uncle to win her favours. They begin writing to one another after Albert has returned home. To maintain control over Victoria, Conroy and the Duchess keep her away from the King's court, and are unhappy when she insists on attending the King's birthday reception. At the reception in Windsor Castle, the King, stating his wish to be closer to Victoria, insults her mother in public twice. The King increases Victoria's income but this is rejected by Conroy, who physically subdues her in front of her mother, heightening the animosity between them. The King is outraged and sends the Whig Prime Minister Lord Melbourne to advise her. Victoria agrees to appoint Lord Melbourne as her private secretary, and he appoints her ladies-in-waiting, including the Duchess of Sutherland. King William dies after Victoria's 18th birthday, avoiding a regency. After accession, Victoria immediately begins to exert her independence, including moving into her own room and banishing Conroy from her household and coronation. During her first meeting with the Privy Council, she announces, ""I am young, but I am willing to learn. And I mean to devote my life in service of my country and my people. I look for your help in this."" Victoria moves into the recently completed Buckingham Palace. The Queen Dowager, Queen Adelaide advises Victoria against accepting all of Lord Melbourne's proposed ladies-in-waiting, but he persists. Lord Melbourne and Albert begin a battle for influence over Victoria. Albert goes to England to spend more time with Victoria. They bond further, dancing during her coronation and Albert hints at going further with their relationship but Victoria resists. Lord Melbourne loses a vote in Parliament, leading Victoria to invite Sir Robert Peel of the Tories to form a new government. However, Victoria refuses to allow Peel to replace her ladies-in-waiting, who are allies of Lord Melbourne. Peel in turn refuses the queen's invitation, allowing Melbourne to continue as prime minister. The subsequent crisis damages Victoria's popularity, leading to demonstrations outside the palace and insults hurled at her in public. The loneliness during the turbulence draws Victoria closer to Albert through their letters. She invites Albert to England and proposes marriage. Victoria and Albert have a loving marriage, but Albert is frustrated at his initial powerlessness in the household. Queen Adelaide advises Victoria to allow Albert to take on more duties, which he does. He reorganises the running of the royal household and dismisses Conroy for mishandling funds. He also becomes Victoria's primary adviser, rejecting the influences of Lord Melbourne and King Leopold. He overreaches when he goes over Victoria's head in a matter with parliamentary politics, leading to a fierce argument between the two. One morning, while riding in a carriage together, Victoria is fired upon by a would-be assassin. Albert shields her, and his bravery leads to their reconciliation. The final title card explains that Victoria and Albert had nine children. Their descendants are the royal families of Britain, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Yugoslavia, Russia, Greece, Romania and Germany. They reigned together for 20 years. Albert died from typhoid fever at age 42. In memory of him, Victoria had his clothes laid out every day until her death at the age of 81. Victoria and Albert championed reforms in education, welfare and industry. They also supported arts and sciences that were celebrated in the Great Exhibition of 1851. Victoria remains the longest reigning British monarch to date.royal family biography royalty period drama queen victoria prince albert 19th century british monarchy",False,tt0962736,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,31878891,0,0,-0.09790519375344643,39.7198236153607,,,,,,,-1343812.5,4,2506187.5,2.0,-2858605.0,1.0,14891395.0,2.0,1707325.0,11.0,28957325.0,4.0,107775620.0,17.0,147344132.66666666,3.0,88756149.76923077,17.0,128710421.92307693,13.0,53464607.333333336,7.0,85131274.0,3.0,24603234.166666668,13.0,68753234.16666667,6.0,82944923.0,4.0,162944923.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,118084069.3076923,156660992.3846154,13.0,,,,,,,,,,5509880.5,40009880.5,2.0,36893312.44444445,56193927.777777776,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-17490877.5,33009122.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,79904861.65705128,44381180.22115385,9.25,4.25,151278235.71911615

He cannot sing, he cannot act, and so he shows the calling he found: the film cuts to a naked Bronson fighting several prison guards in a cage. The film then presents several assorted points from his life, intercut with Bronson on stage before an audience in several stages of performance make-up, and speaking directly to camera while seemingly behind bars. Michael Peterson is shown as a baby, and then as a young boy involved in fights with pupils and a teacher at school using a desk as a weapon. He had his first job at a chip shop, where he committed his first crime, stealing money from the cash register and giving some of the money and a kiss to a young woman who was working there. He then goes on to marry the woman, Irene, and has a baby with her. Peterson goes to jail after robbing a post office and getting away with a small amount of cash. Peterson thrives in prison, comparing it to a hotel room, and every night he displays violent behaviour towards the guards, which causes the other inmates to treat him like a star. The authorities send him to a series of different prisons in hope that one of them will be able to handle him, but nothing seems to help. Eventually he is sent to Rampton Secure Hospital, where he is injected with high doses of sedative drugs every time he tries to start a fight. A man approaches Peterson while he is being subdued with drugs and seems to be sympathetic to Peterson. This soon changes as the man, John White, reveals that he is a paedophile and suggests that he and Peterson should rape a nine-year-old girl. The furious Peterson expresses aggressive hate towards the man, but is unable to do anything against him. In an attempt to prove his sanity and be sent back to prison he finally tries to strangle the paedophile after pretending to be calm for several days. Because of this he is sent to the high-security psychiatric hospital, Broadmoor, where he starts a large-scale riot. News footage from the actual event shows Peterson up on the roof, thus being branded ""Her Majesty's most expensive prisoner"". He is then certified sane and therefore released into the general population. While on parole and living with his uncle in Luton, he becomes involved in bareknuckle boxing and human baiting and changes his name to Charles ""Charlie"" Bronson, after the famous actor. This career ends quickly after he falls in love with a woman, steals an engagement ring, proposes to her and is arrested for robbery. He was out of prison for only 69 days. Back in prison, he is once again involved in several fights with guards, thus extending his sentence. The character of his violent outbursts starts to become more sophisticated. At one event he holds a prison officer hostage before stripping naked and greasing himself up to fight riot officers. The governor tells him: ""If you continue this, you will die here."" He becomes interested in art, which the prison officials think is a good way to develop his interacting skills with other human beings. Eventually this project gets out of hand when Bronson holds his art teacher hostage, ties him to a pole, puts an apple in his mouth, and paints the hostage's face.

Despite the fact employment is scarce and her meager income is the family's only source of revenue, Sofia's once-aristocratic relatives scorn her for her choice of profession and insist she keep it a secret from her child. Sofia eventually meets Todd Jackson, a former official of the U.S. State Department who recently lost his wife and children in separate terrorist bombings. The bombing that killed his child also left him blind. Using his substantial winnings from a well-placed bet at the racetrack, he opens an elegant nightclub catering to the cosmopolitan upper class and invites Sofia to work for him as his primary hostess, an offer she accepts, and in honor of her he calls the club ""The White Countess.""

Seventeen year-old Carl , recently expelled from school, is sent to stay with his godfather Quentin , who runs the station ""Radio Rock"" anchored in the North Sea. The eclectic crew of disc jockeys and staffers, led by brash American DJ ""The Count"" , quickly accept Carl as one of their own. ""Doctor"" Dave  attempts to help him lose his virginity, but the plan goes awry and results in embarrassment for Carl. In London, government minister Sir Alistair Dormandy  resolves to shut down pirate radio stations due to their commercialism and low morals, instructing his subordinate Twatt  to find legal loopholes that will serve this end. They attempt to cut off the stations' revenue by prohibiting British businesses from advertising on unlicensed radio stations. Quentin counters this by bringing massively popular DJ Gavin Kavanagh  out of retirement and onto Radio Rock, enticing his advertisers to work around the law by paying their bills from abroad. Gavin's popularity creates a rivalry between himself and The Count. On his eighteenth birthday Carl is introduced to Quentin's niece Marianne  and falls instantly in love with her, but is heartbroken when she is seduced by Doctor Dave. Carl's roommate ""Thick"" Kevin  observes that the sex, drug, and alcohol-filled atmosphere of Radio Rock is clearly no place for Carl to get on the straight-and-narrow. He theorises that the real reason Carl's mother sent him there is that his father—whom Carl has never met—is someone on the ship, with Quentin being the likeliest suspect. DJ ""Simple"" Simon Swafford  marries Elenore  in an onboard ceremony, but soon learns that she only married him as a means to live on the ship and be with Gavin, with whom she is infatuated. The Count challenges Gavin to a game of chicken in defence of Simon's honour: The two DJs climb one of the ship's radio masts in a clash of egos, reconciling after they are both injured by jumping into the ocean below. Marianne returns and apologizes to Carl for sleeping with Doctor Dave, and she and Carl have sex. When Carl's mother Charlotte  visits for Christmas, she denies his suspicion that Quentin is his father. As she departs, Carl passes on a cryptic message from reclusive late-night DJ ""Smooth"" Bob Silver , leading to the unexpected revelation that Bob is actually his father. Meanwhile, Dormandy's mission to ban pirate radio advances when Twatt comes across news of a fishing boat whose distress call was blocked by Radio Rock's powerful signal. Twatt proposes the creation of the Marine Offences Act, which will make pirate radio stations illegal on the grounds that they endanger other vessels. Despite public opinion being heavily in support of the pirate stations, the Act passes unanimously through Parliament and takes effect at midnight on 1 January 1967. The Radio Rock crew choose to defy the law and continue to broadcast, firing up the ship's engine so that they may avoid arrest by relocating. The ageing vessel cannot take the strain, however: the engine explodes and the ship begins to sink. The DJs broadcast their position in hope of aid, but Dormandy refuses to send rescue boats. Carl rescues the oblivious Bob from his cabin while The Count vows to continue broadcasting as long as possible. With the lifeboats inoperable, the crew gathers on the prow as the ship sinks. They are rescued by dozens of fans who have heard their broadcast and sailed out to save them; Carl himself is rescued by Marianne. The Radio Rock ship disappears beneath the sea, with The Count emerging from the sinking vessel at the last moment. Though pirate radio in Britain comes to an end, the music lives on, with rock and pop becoming increasingly popular in subsequent decades.great britain musical rock pirate radio swinging 60s",False,tt1131729,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,36348784,1,0,-0.3755618344756733,39.7198236153607,73300453.26666667,110711564.37777779,91612320.38461539,116387243.46153846,,,,0,,,38824773.666666664,11.0,73491440.33333333,3.0,91605244.0,10.0,134105244.0,4.0,58566723.14285714,6.0,100709580.28571428,7.0,48361595.0,20.0,70211595.0,10.0,31618764.0,5.0,40285430.666666664,3.0,138808656.83333334,20.0,171475323.5,6.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,204931766.0,244931766.0,1.0,,,,200695196.0,282895196.0,5.0,233212670.0,251212670.0,1.0,84973248.22727273,113194157.31818181,22.0,,,,-4249278.5,8250721.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30963686.6,52563686.6,5.0,,,,,,,,,,5796544.0,8176544.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,98379768.96428572,67964292.77380952,9.0,5.5,151278235.71911615

Years ago, he had carved the image of his heart into a pine tree for his secret love Leona, but lightning hits the pine tree. A few years later, Geppetto finds the pine tree again, but it splits in half and rolls down the bank, landing at his feet. Geppetto is intrigued upon his discovery and takes the log home. He discovers that the pine log refuses to be burned, and so he decides to carve the new puppet with it. His puppet, named Pinocchio, is soon mysteriously animated by a somewhat sentient force after his creation, and Pinocchio approaches the woodcutter, initially alarming him, but then Pinocchio becomes aware of a pigeon on the window and decides to chase the bird. After a chase throughout the town, Gepetto finally finds Pinocchio and starts teaching him about how to behave. However, after a short conversation Geppetto has with another woodcutter, Pinocchio runs off. First he sees a boy with a red ball who throws the ball at Pinocchio's head. Pinocchio then goes after the ball and becomes involved with two thieves, Volpe and Felinet, who attempt to flatter Pinocchio, but then Geppetto comes to the rescue and warns Pinocchio to mix with the right people. Volpe and Felinet go to the puppet master Lorenzini  who owns a luxurious puppet theatre. Felinet tells him about Pinocchio, and Lorenzini appears interested, so he visits Geppetto that afternoon to barter for Pinocchio. However, although Pinocchio is somewhat taken to Lorenzini, Geppetto refuses to sell Pinocchio. Later, Pinocchio follows a group a schoolchildren and becomes fascinated by school and learning, to which he wants to go for, in which Gepetto allows. But a boy named Lampwick  and Lampwick's friend Saleo  involves him in a violent prank. The teacher punishes Pinocchio harshly for sneezing his sawdust all over him, forcing him to leave the company of the real boys. Out of bitterness, he then causes a great deal of mischief in a bakery, in which the baker's wife  causes more damage than the puppet. Geppetto is held responsible for the puppet's actions and is arrested. While Geppetto spends the night in a prison cell, Pinocchio returns home and meets 'the voice of truth' in the form of a wise and optimistic cricket named ""Pepe"". He promises to help Pinocchio to become a real boy, if he will start acting to be a good person. The next day, Geppetto and Pinocchio stand before the judge, who rules that, unless Geppetto can pay for the damage Pinocchio caused, he will be sent in prison for three years. Lorenzini steps in and offers to pay off the debt, on the condition that Pinocchio be handed over to his custody. Geppetto strongly refuses but eventually gives in, believing that perhaps the puppet will be better off that way. Pinocchio is heartbroken and does not want to leave his ""father"", but Geppetto tells them that he cannot be his father . Pinocchio comes to enjoy the theatre and also comes to believe that Lorenzini loves him as much as his father did, after receiving few golden coins by him. Pepe tells him that Lorenzini is just using him to get rich and success. Pinocchio comes to realize this as he performs in Lorenzini's play, and manages to save several puppets from being burned by the cruel Lorenzini. As he escapes, he accidentally sets the theatre aflame. He floats away down the river, passing through the woodlands to a quiet monastery, after being attacked by a woodpecker. Volpe and Felinet catch up with him and manage to swindle him out of golden coins by telling him that if he buries them in the ground, they will grow into a tree of miracles that will turn him into a real boy. Pepe scolds the puppet and proclaims: ""Miracles don't grow on trees. Miracles are made in the heart!"" Meanwhile, Geppetto  and Leona have begun searching the forest for Pinocchio. However, Pinocchio is enticed by Lampwick to join a wagon-load of other boys who are being taken to the ""Terra Magica"", where they are encouraged to perform several bad deeds such as Ripping Books Having Pillow Fights Smashing Windows Shooting with Guns and Riding the Roller Coaster. During the trip, Pinocchio's hat falls into a river and later Geppetto and Leona arrive and find it on a beach, thinking that Pinocchio is lost at sea. Before striking out in a rowboat to search for the son, Geppetto professes his love for Leona. Meanwhile Pinocchio Lampwick and Saleo go on the Roller Coaster where they get douced with a load of water from a fountain that suddenly turns the boys into Donkeys. Then they are rounded up by Lorenzini, who runs the park after abandoning his career as a puppet master. Pinocchio, having grown only donkey ears, frees the donkeys from their pen. Chased by Lorenzini and his henchmen, Pinocchio attempts to warn the other boys of the cursed water in the fountain. No one believes him until Pinocchio makes donkey-Lampwick kick Lorenzini sending him into the fountain's pool, and as Lorenzini gets out of the fountain and jumps in a river, he transforms into a ""monster"". The boys, having learned of the park's curse as well as their lessons, run away together to get back to their homes, scaring much of Lorenzini's henchmen away, and leaving Pinocchio and the donkey-Lampwick to journey back home alone. However, when Pinocchio arrives, she is still there, and takes care of Lampwick while reluctantly allowing Pinocchio to row a boat to find Geppetto. However, the puppet gets swallowed by Lorenzini, now transformed into a monstrous whale. Inside Lorenzini's belly, Pinocchio is finally reunited with Geppetto. In order to escape, Pinocchio tells Geppetto that he hates him. The lie causes Pinocchio's nose to lengthen again and push the whale's throat open wider. The nose then breaks from Pinocchio, but still holds the throat. Unable to breathe properly because of this, Lorenzini is forced to vomit both Pinocchio and Geppetto out before he succumbs. Geppetto and Pinocchio make it back to shore, where Geppetto apologizes for giving Pinocchio away and tells him that he loves him, finally transforming the puppet into a real boy. On the way home, Pinocchio runs into Volpe and Felinet and tricks them into drinking from the fountain of the park where he and the other boys were turned into donkeys . Pinocchio returns to live life as a real boy with Gepetto, Leona and his best friend Lampwick, who changed back to normal along with the other cursed boys by becoming good and doing good deeds.italy parent child relationship talk show love school boys",True,tt0115472,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,36682170,1,0,0.46728679999999995,-1.2635471289974909,,,14595667.0,22989667.0,3842000.0,25842000.0,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,56576255.24926193

The ship is on a mission from an overpopulated Earth to the earth-like extrasolar planet Tanis on a colonizing mission. With no recent memory and the ship racked by power surges from its unstable reactor, Payton sends Bower to stabilize the reactor, since his position and latent memories imply that he is an engineer. While making his way through the ship, Bower finds emaciated corpses and has to avoid strange, pale humanoid beasts who use bladed weapons and lassos to catch and kill their prey. He also finds several people who had been awake far longer than he and Payton, including a genetic engineer named Nadia  and an agricultural expert called Manh . During his journey, Bower experiences the physical symptoms of a mental disorder encountered in long periods of space travel, called ‘Pandorum’. At one point, Payton tells of a prior case where the captain of a passenger ship went mad with the syndrome and, believing the flight was cursed, ejected all the passengers and himself into space, dooming them all. On the flight deck, Payton discovers another crew member, Corporal Gallo , who reveals that he was part of the flight crew that received a final message from Earth, saying that the planet had been destroyed and the only hope for humanity was the Elysium. He claims that his other two crew mates suffered from an onset of Pandorum, and that he had to kill them in self-defense. Payton is wary of Gallo, noting his strange behavior. It is eventually shown that Gallo has Pandorum and is dangerously insane. Avoiding the creatures, Bower, Manh and Nadia find their way into an enclosed area where another survivor called Leland . While gassing his visitors with the purpose of using them as food, Leland tells them the origins of the ships and the creatures, using self-drawn murals on the walls; after the final message from Earth was received, one of the flight crew was overcome with Pandorum and killed his two crew-mates, eventually sinking into a delusion that he was a god of the ship. Alone and insane, the 'god-devil' released several hundred of the passengers and sent them down into the massive hold to fight for survival, all as part of a sadistic game. Eventually bored with his game, the crew member went into hypersleep and the awakened passengers had to survive and fight each other. Eventually, because a special enzyme given to the passengers during hypersleep to help them adapt to conditions on Tanis, the survivors evolved into the tribal creatures that now roam the ship. While Payton tries to keep Gallo under control on the bridge, even sealing him inside a hibernation pod, Bower convinces Leland to keep them alive so they can reboot the reactor and save the ship from destruction. They manage this, barely, and begin to make their way to the bridge, but Manh is killed on the way by a baby creature, though he manages to kill their leader . On the bridge, after Payton injects Gallo with a sedative during a fight, the shocking truth is revealed; Payton is Gallo. He had lost all his memories during his hibernation, but regains them after injecting himself during his delirium. He then kills Leland, who arrives before the others. When Bower and Nadia arrive, Payton admits his actions and tries to make Bower succumb to Pandorum by showing him where the Elysium is now; it crashed on Tanis, and is now lying in the alien world's ocean: the 123-year mission has extended into 923 years. As Payton rants about building a new humanity within the ship  and Bower fights his descent into madness, Nadia attacks Payton, but he easily defeats her. Bower manages to overcome his condition and breaks the window of the ship, getting himself and Nadia into a hibernation pod and activating the pod-jettison action, sending everyone who is still alive to safety, while Payton and the creatures are killed as the ship is flooded.

Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the biological neural network native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one final chance to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Na'vi, Jake confesses to being a spy and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father  and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón , disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, carries them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape, Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace. To regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honoured by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred Tree of Souls and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can complete. Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey , who acts as Jake's translator, Jake speaks to unite the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle against the RDA. Noticing the impending gathering, Quaritch organizes a pre-emptive strike against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection to the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi. During the subsequent battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch escapes from the crashing bomber, wearing an AMP suit and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch then prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation. With the exceptions of Jake, Norm, Max and a few other scientists, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth, after which Jake is transferred permanently into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.culture clash future space war space colony society space travel futuristic romance space alien tribe alien planet marine soldier battle love affair space opera anti war power relations mind and soul",False,tt0499549,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,2787965087,1,0,10.763565767932489,39.7198236153607,182585830.2,304585830.2,,,114376422.35714285,137498922.35714287,171353001.0,0,371353001.0,1.0,,0.0,,,44729358.0,0.0,68729358.0,1.0,57507138.333333336,30.0,90590471.66666667,6.0,,0.0,,,-12041304.0,5.0,57958696.0,1.0,69984862.0,7.0,102984862.0,1.0,,0.0,,,165163207.5,258913207.5,2.0,72657389.14285715,121443103.42857143,7.0,,,,,,,96542733.0,216542733.0,2.0,,,,118393827.5,130843827.5,2.0,153294555.66666666,264627889.0,3.0,174868133.0,287368133.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,-25454936.0,1545064.0,1.0,,,,27784194.0,87784194.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40103895.0,57103895.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,138323277.73333335,66306611.06666667,5.25,2.0,151278235.71911615

On a rainy London night in 1946, Bendrix has a chance meeting with Henry Miles , husband of his former mistress Sarah , who abruptly ended their affair two years before. Bendrix's obsession with Sarah is rekindled; he succumbs to his own jealousy and works his way back into her life. As the story unfolds in 1946, we also see flashbacks of Bendrix with Sarah as they began their affair during World War II. Henry tells Bendrix that he believes Sarah is having an affair, so Bendrix hires the bumbling but amiable Parkis , who uses his young birthmarked son  to investigate. Sarah asks Bendrix to meet to talk about Henry, and the cold tentativeness of their interaction is contrasted with the passion of their earlier encounters. Bendrix learns from Parkis that Sarah has been making regular visits to a priest  under the guise of false dentist visits, and he grows increasingly jealous. Flashbacks show Bendrix expressing jealousy of Henry and asking Sarah to leave him. Though Sarah and Bendrix express love to each other, the affair ends abruptly when a bomb explodes near Bendrix's building as he is out in the hallway. Bendrix falls down a staircase and awakes later, bloodied but not seriously hurt. He walks upstairs, where Sarah is shocked that he is alive. Bendrix accuses Sarah of being disappointed that he survived; and she leaves, telling him ""Love doesn't end, just because we don't see each other."" In 1946, Parkis obtains Sarah's diary and passes it on to Bendrix; it shows the affair from her perspective. After Bendrix is hurt by the bomb, Sarah runs downstairs and finds him still and not breathing. After trying to revive him, she runs back upstairs and begins to pray for Bendrix's life. Just as she says to God that she will stop seeing Bendrix if he is brought back, Bendrix comes into the room. Now knowing why Sarah ended the affair, Bendrix follows Sarah and begs her to reconsider. Sarah tells Bendrix that she has felt dead without him and can no longer keep her ""promise"" to God. Henry, who has figured out that it is Bendrix who was Sarah's lover, desperately asks Sarah not to leave him. But, with more persuasion from Bendrix, Sarah agrees to go away with him for a weekend. Henry tracks the couple down to tell them that Sarah has a terminal illness. Bendrix stays with Henry and Sarah over her final days; and, at her funeral, Parkis tells Bendrix that a chance encounter with Sarah cured his son of his birthmark. At Henry and Sarah's house, Bendrix completes his book; and it is revealed that his diary of hate is directed toward God. While Sarah doesn't need to see God to love Him, Bendrix prays God will leave him alone, thereby finally acknowledging His existence.london, england bomb sex jealousy infidelity obsession world war ii passion romance cheating wife church london blitz 1940s",False,tt0172396,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,10827816,0,0,-1.1241587407839218,15.965307217698705,24941483.666666668,34113705.88888889,,,,,97044691.0,3,116794691.0,2.0,23871704.5,7.0,39724473.5,2.0,17862379.5,1.0,32362379.5,2.0,368054.0,37.0,581138.0,1.0,-11100000.0,3.0,16900000.0,1.0,-33326758.0,2.0,26673242.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23871704.5,39724473.5,2.0,,,,50043682.0,61793682.0,6.0,,,,16714469.666666666,29949649.0,3.0,,,,-5594131.25,14905868.75,4.0,49657004.333333336,67774594.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,23871704.5,39724473.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,-1173477.0,2826523.0,1.0,,,,110532341.5,139782341.5,4.0,,,,20156161.818181816,44537980.0,11.0,,,38839320.666666664,15786678.5,6.625,1.5,73407251.10798967

A veteran of the Third Crusade and Richard's war against Phillip II of France, he now takes part in the siege against Chalus Castle. Disillusioned and war-weary, he believes the King when he invites him to give an honest view of the war and the King's conduct. After Robin gives a frank but unflattering appraisal, Richard breaks his promise and has Robin and comrades taken prisoner to be judged after ending the siege. The betrayed men decide to free themselves and desert. Following Richard's death, Robin and two other common archers, Allan A'Dayle , Will Scarlett , as well as soldier Little John , attempt to secretly return to their homeland after fighting abroad for the past 10 years. Along the way they come across an ambush of the Royal guard by Sir Godfrey , an English knight collaborating with the French. Philip II had ordered Sir Godfrey to assassinate Richard. Having discovered the King is already slain, Sir Godfrey is chased off by the arrival of Robin and his companions. Aiming to return to England safely and richer in pocket than when they left it, Robin and his men steal the armour of the slain knights and, under the guise of noblemen, head for the English ships on the coast. Before leaving the scene of slaughter, Robin promises one of the dying knights, Robert Loxley , to return a sword to the knight's father in Nottingham. Upon arriving in England, Robin  is brought to London and chosen to inform the Royal family of the King's death. He witnesses the coronation of King John , the younger brother of Richard. John orders harsh taxes to be collected, sending Sir Godfrey off to the North to do so. He has no idea that Godfrey is a French agent who, using French troops, will use this Royal Decree to stir up enough unrest to cause civil war in England. Robin and his companions head to Nottingham, where Loxley's elderly, blind father Sir Walter  asks him to continue impersonating his son, in order to prevent the family lands being taken by the crown. Loxley's widow, Lady Marian , is initially distrustful of Robin, but soon warms to him when he recovers taxed grain for the townsfolk to plant. Meanwhile, Godfrey's actions have stirred up the northern barons, who march to meet King John and demand the signing of a charter of rights. Having realized Godfrey's deception, and knowing he must reunite his people in order to meet an imminent French invasion, the King agrees. A battle follows in which Robin and the northern barons attack Godfrey's men while the latter are ransacking Nottingham—but not before Godfrey has slain the blind Sir Walter. The film climaxes with a French invasion on England's Cliffs of Dover, opposed by an English army. In the midst of the chaos, Marian attempts to kill Godfrey but he gains the upper hand over her and prepares to kill her. However, Robin intervenes and duels Godfrey himself. The English are victorious and Godfrey attempts to flee on horseback, but Robin shoots an arrow, from long distance, which pierces straight through Godfrey's neck. When King John sees the French surrendering to Robin rather than to himself, he senses a major threat to his power.

Bush in Chicago around a year earlier on 19 October 2007. The president is fatally shot by a sniper after he addresses an economic forum at the Chicago Sheraton Hotel, before which an anti-war rally had taken place. News outlets immediately begin reporting on the incident along with its political ramifications. After authorities earlier arrest and interrogate war-protesting detainees such as Frank Molini  and Samir Masri ; an IT professional of Syrian origin, Jamal Abu Zikri , becomes the prime suspect. Vice President Dick Cheney, now president, uses the possible al-Qaeda relationship in connection with the suspected assassin, Zikri, to push his own domestic political security agenda. He calls for the legislation of PATRIOT Act III, trying to increase the investigative powers of the FBI, the police, and other government agencies over U.S. citizens and resident aliens as he contemplates attacking Syria. As his wife Zahra  listens to the verdict with family attorney Dawn Norton  in a packed courtroom, Zikri is convicted of killing the U.S. President and sentenced to death based upon dubious forensic evidence. Meanwhile, a new report which surfaces, substantiated by interviews with Marianne Claybon , indicates that the perpetrator is most likely her husband Al Claybon , a veteran of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, who lived in Rock Island, Illinois, and who also was the father of David Claybon, a U.S. soldier recently killed in the Iraq War. The assassin, who blames President Bush for the death of his son, killed himself after Bush's assassination. Claybon's suicide note, addressed to a second son, Casey Claybon , an Iraq War veteran living in Chicago who was previously considered as a suspect, reads: {{cquote}} Ten months after President Bush's assassination, Zikri remains on death row at the Stateville Correctional Center, because government officials are deliberately delaying his legal appeal. Moreover, in his dead father's Rock Island house, Casey Claybon finds evidence of his father's planning of the shooting. The most incriminating piece of evidence is a copy of a top secret presidential itinerary outlining, to the minute, President Bush's Chicago whereabouts on 19 October 2007. The news report ends while the U.S. Government continues investigating how presidential assassin Al Claybon obtained that top secret document. The final closing titles of the film inform the viewer that President Cheney's USA PATRIOT Act III, was signed into permanent law in the U.S., stating the following: ""It has granted investigators unprecedented powers of detention and surveillance, and further expanded the powers of the executive branch"".assassination politics",False,tt0853096,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,167000,1,0,-10.976047904191619,-3.847336948521819,,,1689813.5,18214813.5,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,92887866.92008553

Revie's replacement is Brian Clough , the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor , has not joined him. The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First DivisionThough Leeds were leading the table, they did not win the league that season, eventually finishing fourth. The eventual winners were Manchester City and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2&ndash;0.Although Leeds did beat Derby 2&ndash;0 in the FA Cup that season, in reality the game was played at United's Elland Road ground. It was the second of three games between the two sides that season, the FA Cup tie being sandwiched between the two legs of a Football League Cup Semi-Final. Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay , along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson  is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5&ndash;0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner ([[Stephen Graham  sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final. Juventus defeat them easily, and Clough publicly lambasts Longson.In fact, the match between Derby and Leeds took place before Derby's quarter-final match, which they won despite their injury list. Their eventual defeat by Juventus was with a nearly full-strength squad, and Clough blamed Juventus's gamesmanship, rather than Sam Longson for Derby's exit. Later that year, after Taylor suffers a heart attack, Clough tries to secure his position by offering up his and Taylor's resignations. To his horror, the club's board call his bluff, terminates their contracts and bans them from entering the Baseball Ground again . Derby fans' outrage raises Clough's hopes of being reinstated, but Dave Mackay is appointed manager instead. Derby fans quickly lose interest and Clough loses all hope of getting his job back. He and Taylor are then offered jobs at Brighton & Hove Albion. They agree to take the jobs after taking an all-expenses-paid holiday in Majorca. During the holiday, Clough agrees to take control of Leeds after being approached by their representatives.The film shows him effectively reneging on his deal to take over at Brighton, although in reality he had nine relatively unsuccessful months as manager there. Taylor, however, argues the case for staying at Brighton, and after a bitter quarrel, the two go their separate ways. Back in the storyline's ""present,"" Clough alienates his players in their first training session, first by telling them that they can throw away any awards they have won because they ""never won any of them fairly,"" and then making them start with a 7-a-side game. The season starts with a Charity Shield match against FA Cup winners Liverpool, which is widely anticipated as both the final match of Liverpool manager Bill Shankly and Clough's debut as Leeds manager. Unfortunately, the event is marred when Leeds's captain, Billy Bremner gets into a fight with Kevin Keegan. Both are sent off, and in turn throw their shirts off and walk off the pitch bare-chested in defiance. Leeds lose the match on penalties, and Bremner is given a two-month suspension from football, forcing Leeds to start the season without their influential captain. As a result, Leeds suffer a horrendous start to the season and are in danger of relegation only one season after winning the title. After Bremner and the players air their grievances to the board, the club terminates Clough's contract - though he forces them to pay an enormous severance package. Afterwards, Clough agrees to do a final interview with Yorkshire Television, but finds Revie there to confront him, bringing the two face to face at last. Clough accuses Revie of being cold-hearted and fundamentally dishonest, both as a person and a football manager, and Revie in turn brands Clough as inflexible and egocentric. Clough brings up the incident in the 1968 FA Cup, and Revie claims to have not known who the rookie manager was at the time . After the interview, Clough drives down to Brighton to patch things up with Taylor. It involves Clough literally on his knees, grovelling at Taylor's dictation, but they reconcile. In the film's epilogue, the audience is told that Don Revie proved a complete failure as an England manager, and afterwards never worked in football in his home country again, spending the rest of his career working in the Middle East where he was accused of financial mismanagement. Brian Clough and Peter Taylor meanwhile reunited at Nottingham Forest, where he repeated his prior achievements with Derby by taking them up and winning the First Division, and this time bettered both Revie and his own spell at Derby by winning two European Cups in succession. The film ends by branding Clough ""the best manager that the English national side never had.""1970s northern england biography leeds united sport yorkshire brighton football (soccer) cup derby county management football (soccer) team leeds",False,tt1226271,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,4199874,0,0,-0.5238552394667078,39.7198236153607,10718909.277777778,26077785.333333332,5796544.0,8176544.0,,,52126910.6,7,98126910.6,5.0,28281764.5,19.0,50344264.5,8.0,2603256.0,6.0,8353256.0,2.0,82193488.42857143,17.0,121793884.0,14.0,,0.0,,,5796544.0,3.0,8176544.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7916563.0,20416563.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42027970.0,48027970.0,1.0,,,,883473.8333333334,15300140.5,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,57358971.82,34200392.705714285,6.5,6.0,151278235.71911615

Although Léa only plans on keeping Chéri around for a short while, their affair turns into a six-year ordeal, in which Léa has begun paying for Chéri's expenses, and Chéri wears Léa's silk pajamas and pearls. The two believe their affair to be casual, and Léa learns from Charlotte that she has arranged for Chéri to marry the daughter of another courtesan, a barely eighteen-year-old named Edmée. Although Chéri does not wish to marry Edmée, it is made clear that he has no choice in the matter. Léa kicks him out of her home, but makes Chéri promise to always be gentle and kind with Edmée, and to try and give her a good life. After Chéri agrees, the two part ways, and do not share glances at Chéri's wedding. It is only after Chéri is on the train to Italy for his honeymoon that both he and Léa realize they are in love with each other. Chéri rapes Edmée and, while taking her virginity, realizes that while sex with Edmée is strained and painful, sex with Léa was easy and fun. Léa visits Charlotte one last time before running off on vacation, making up a story in which she is involved in with another suitor, when in fact the only man Léa beds while on vacation is a young bodybuilder whom she has no feelings for and regards as a one-night-stand. Meanwhile, Edmée accuses Chéri of not caring about her, and says all he ever does is think of Léa. While out on the town with a friend, Chéri tries opium and cocaine, and on his way back he notices that Léa's apartment is no longer empty, and she has returned home. Feeling refreshed, Chéri runs home to Edmée where he makes love to her properly and kindly. He sends Charlotte the next day to inspect Léa's home, whereupon Léa says she is madly in love with her new ""suitor"", and learns  from Charlotte that Chéri and Edmée are crazily in love and happier than ever. That night, after hearing from Charlotte that Léa is in love with her suitor, Chéri breaks into her home and admits he loves her. The two spend one more night together and plan on running away. In the morning, however, Léa apologizes to Chéri for ""ruining him"" and making life too easy on him when they first begun their affair. Léa tells Chéri to go back to Edmée, for their age difference would always prevent a true relationship blossoming between them. Tentatively, Chéri leaves. Léa stares into her mirror at her aging face, and the narrator reveals she is angry for being born two decades before Chéri. The narrator also reveals that, after a while, Chéri realizes that Léa was the only woman he could ever love, and he commits suicide.",False,tt1179258,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,9366227,0,0,-1.4556312803437286,39.7198236153607,,,,,1037205.3636363636,14953569.0,81670188.5,21,135170188.5,4.0,7121838.5,11.0,57121838.5,2.0,7916563.0,1.0,20416563.0,1.0,,0.0,,,17126295.0,9.0,47126295.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,81624197.5,138374197.5,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,36943172.0,51908172.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22818301.25,36818301.25,4.0,47263992.0,62263992.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,41610699.5,65360699.5,4.0,54167130.5,66667130.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,37131143.8,73931143.8,5.0,,,,,,,,,64958721.25,28458721.25,5.25,2.0,151278235.71911615

We see a brief flashback to a woman leaving her baby in a basement surrounded by flickering candles. Before departing from the house, she quickly drops a string of pearls on the child's pillow, twined around a single rose. Years later, 16-year-old Stella Bradshaw  lives in a working class household with her Uncle Vernon ([[Alun Armstrong  and Aunt Lily  in Liverpool. Lacking an adult in her life that she feels close to, she frequently goes into phone booths to speak with her mother, who never appears in the film. Stella has no interest in schoolwork and her uncle, who sees a theatrical career as being her only alternative to working behind the counter at Woolworth’s, signs her up for speech lessons and pulls the strings to get her involved at a regional playhouse. After an unsuccessful audition, Stella gets a job gofering for Meredith Potter , the troupe's sleazy, eccentric director. The impressionable Stella develops a crush on the worldly, self-absorbed Potter, whose homosexuality completely eludes her. Potter reveals himself to be a cruel, apathetic man who treats Stella and everyone else around him with scorn and condescension and has a long history of exploiting young men. His latest dalliance is with Geoffrey ([[Alan Cox , another teenage apprentice. Stella is quickly caught up in the backstage intrigue and also becomes the object of passes from several men surrounding the theatre company, among them P.L. O'Hara , a brilliant actor who has returned to the troupe for a stint playing Captain Hook in its Christmas production of Peter Pan. In keeping with theatrical tradition, O'Hara also doubles in the role of Mr. Darling.  O'Hara carries himself with grace and charisma, but privately is as troubled and disillusioned as the other members of the cast. Haunted by his wartime experiences and a lost love , O'Hara embarks on an affair with Stella, to whom he feels an inexplicably deep emotional connection. Stella, who still has her mind set on winning Potter's favor, remains emotionally detached but takes advantage of O'Hara's affections, seeing it as an opportunity to gain sexual experience. Disturbed by Stella's pursuance of the abusive Potter, O'Hara visits her aunt and uncle, who fill him in on Stella's history. He soon finds out that Stella's long-missing mother was his lost love, whom he then knew by the nickname Stella Maris, making Stella — who he's been sleeping with — his child, a daughter rather than the son he had imagined. Keeping his discovery to himself, O'Hara gets on his motorcycle and drives back out to the seaport. Distracted, he slips on the wet gangplank, hits his head and is pitched into the water. Potter takes on the role of Captain Hook for the last performance. Stella is later seen hastening to the phone booth to confide her woes over the phone to ""her mother"" — as has been her habit throughout the film. We are suddenly reminded that the absent Stella Maris had years ago won a nationwide contest to be the voice of the speaking clock. It is her recorded voice that provides the only response to her daughter's confidences.england based on novel or book liverpool theatre company 1940s",False,tt0112427,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,851545,0,0,-3.697344239000875,2.52164293872272,-3137195.0,1862805.0,4228953.0,5728953.0,,,,0,,,63997715.75,7.0,70247715.75,4.0,,0.0,,,-6024859.0,12.0,10975141.0,2.0,-13396455.0,10.0,11603545.0,1.0,5358072.5,12.0,13358072.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,248700832.0,254700832.0,1.0,-6342615.0,11657385.0,1.0,26318843.0,51818843.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,248700832.0,254700832.0,1.0,33447536.5,40270126.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33447536.5,40270126.5,2.0,,,26546118.5625,12483618.5625,5.125,2.25,104897737.26798174

Scott meets an American girl, Ramona Flowers, who has been appearing in his dreams, and becomes obsessed with her, losing interest in Knives. While playing in a battle of the bands sponsored by one ""G-Man Graves"" for a record deal, Scott is attacked by Matthew Patel, who introduces himself as the first of Ramona's ""evil exes"". Scott defeats Patel and learns from Ramona that, in order for them to date, he must defeat all seven of her evil exes. Scott breaks up with Knives, who blames Ramona for taking Scott from her and begins trying to win him back. Scott battles Ramona's second evil ex, popular actor and skateboarder Lucas Lee, who he defeats by tricking him into performing a dangerous skateboard grind that causes him to combust. Scott later encounters the third evil ex, Todd Ingram, who is dating Scott's ex-girlfriend, Natalie ""Envy"" Adams. Todd initially overpowers Scott using his psychic vegan abilities, but is stripped of his powers by the Vegan Police after Scott tricks him into drinking coffee with half and half cream, allowing Scott to defeat him. Scott begins to grow upset with Ramona over her dating history by the defeat of the fourth ex, Roxy Richter. During the second round of the battle of the bands, Sex Bob-omb faces off against the fifth and sixth evil exes, twin Katayanagi brothers Kyle and Ken, earning Scott an extra life upon their defeat. During the battle, Scott sees Ramona together with her seventh evil ex, Gideon Graves, who turns out to be Sex Bob-omb's sponsor, G-Man. The members of Sex Bob-omb accept Gideon's record deal, except for Scott, who leaves the band. Shortly after, Ramona breaks up with Scott. Upon returning home, Scott receives a phone call invitation from Gideon to his newly opened Chaos Theater where Sex Bob-omb is playing, claiming there to be ""no hard feelings"". Scott arrives and challenges Gideon to a fight, professing his love for Ramona and gaining a sword called the ""Power of Love"", which Gideon easily destroys. Knives then crashes the scene to fight Ramona over Scott. Scott goes to break up the girls' fight, only to accidentally reveal that he cheated on them with each other before he is killed by Gideon. Ramona visits Scott in Limbo and apologizes for getting him involved in her affairs, revealing that Gideon had planted a mind control device in the back of her head. Scott realizes he still has an extra life and uses it to return to life at the moment in time when Gideon first called him. Scott reenters the Chaos Theater where he makes peace with his friends and challenges Gideon again, stating he is fighting for himself and gaining the much stronger ""Power of Self-Respect"" sword with which he strikes down Gideon. He then apologizes to Ramona and Knives for cheating on them, but Gideon interferes and knocks down Ramona, leading Scott and Knives to team up and defeat him. Free from Gideon's control, Ramona prepares to leave, but Knives accepts that her relationship with Scott is over and encourages him to follow Ramona. He does, and the two start their relationship anew.canada toronto, canada animated sequence based on graphic novel whipping hipster underage girlfriend unconsciousness girl fight vegan aftercreditsstinger",False,tt0446029,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,47664559,1,0,-0.2587969186917265,-2.2977368060284267,69275438.13725491,111500928.33333333,,,68573774.0,80573774.0,,0,,,273531464.0,3.0,383531464.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-7553562.0,5.0,446438.0,1.0,-7553562.0,5.0,446438.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,47453079.5,55453079.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-4796956.0,13203044.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,47453079.5,55453079.5,2.0,84394835.0,129394835.0,1.0,47453079.5,55453079.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,128141446.66666667,86141446.66666667,1.625,1.0,102557850.13709407

They are informed via videotape that whoever sets more flesh weight on their tray will survive. Eddie cuts fat from his torso, but Simone chops off her entire left arm, killing Eddie. After being released from the glass box, Mark Hoffman  is called to the scene of the opening trap by Dan Erickson , who found Peter Strahm's fingerprints around the room. He reveals that Lindsey Perez  is still alive; since they had not known who Jigsaw's accomplice was, Erickson had kept her survival a secret. After running into Pamela Jenkins , a reporter, Hoffman meets with Jill Tuck  at her clinic to inform her that he is taking control of the games. Jill gives him five envelopes containing photos of people to be tested, left to her in the box from John Kramer's  will. John had previously brought Amanda Young  to Jill, who had given up on helping Amanda, as proof that his methods worked. It is later shown that John gave Jill the key to the box at the meatpacking plant just before he was killed. William Easton , a health insurance executive, talks with his company's attorney, Debbie , about Harold Abbott , who died from an illness after his insurance policy was revoked due to an application discrepancy. He is kidnapped from his office that night and brought to an abandoned zoo, and awakens in a vise designed to tighten around his torso each time he breathes into an oxygen respirator. Hank , his janitor and a smoker, is in the same trap across from him. A videotape of John tells William that he has one hour to undergo four tests to remove bombs from his limbs, or he will lose his family. He is able to hold his breath longer than Hank, who is killed by the vise. In his second test, he must choose to save either Allen , his healthy but orphaned file clerk, or Addy , his diabetic secretary who is surrounded by family. His policy favors Allen, but he saves Addy and Allen is hanged when his platform retracts. In his third test, William is able to guide Debbie through a boiler room maze, only to learn through X-rays that the key to her device is stitched into his side. She attacks him with a saw, but is killed when the device fires a spear through her head. In his fourth test, William finds his six staff members chained to a spinning carousel. A shotgun is set to fire at them one by one, but he can save two by pushing a button to drive a spike into his hand and divert the shotgun. He chooses to save Emily and Shelby. William's progress is viewed by Brent and Tara , who awaken in a cage below the observation room. Pamela awakens in another cage on the other side. Flashbacks throughout the tests reveal that William and John met at the opening of Jill's clinic, and that John immediately found fault with William's methods, which essentially choose who lives or dies. John later went to William for coverage for a Norwegian cancer treatment and was rejected. Meanwhile, Hoffman is called away by Erickson, who informs him that abnormalities were found in Strahm's fingerprints, and that the Seth Baxter tape was retrieved, but the voice did not match Jigsaw's. Erickson and Perez bring Hoffman to the site where a technician is unscrambling the voice, where Erickson reveals that he knows of Strahm's death. The moment Hoffman's voice is unscrambled, he kills everyone in the room, plants fingerprints from Strahm's hand, retrieved after escaping the glass box, and then sets the room on fire to destroy the evidence. Upon returning to the observation room, he finds the letter he had written to Amanda to blackmail her into killing Lynn Denlon, using the knowledge that Amanda was the reason why Cecil Adams  had robbed Jill's clinic. The letter was left by Jill, who subdues Hoffman using an electric shock just as William reaches the end of the path, finding himself between the two cages. It is shown that William and Pamela are siblings, while Tara and Brent are Harold's surviving family. A videotape of John informs Tara that she can either kill William or free him using a marked switch. Brent angrily shifts the switch to ""Die"" when Tara is unable to do so, and William is killed when a platform of needles pierces his back and pumps hydrofluoric acid into his body. Jill restrains Hoffman and secures a newer Reverse Bear-trap to his head, and then reveals that there was a sixth envelope, which contained his photograph. She leaves him with 45 seconds but no key; he escapes his restraints by breaking his hand, and escapes the trap by lodging it into the bars of the door's window, screaming as his right cheek is torn open.fbi murder violence killer agent death aftercreditsstinger",False,tt1233227,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,68233629,1,0,5.203057181818182,39.7198236153607,-15707086.0,8292914.0,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,-3455538.0,44462.0,1.0,,,,,,,-3455538.0,44462.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-3455538.0,44462.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,151278235.71911615

Al-Rawi suggests waiting for the Americans to arrive and have them perhaps make his army an offer to join their forces in forming a government coalition against foreign insurgents. Four weeks later, U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller  and his squad investigate a warehouse, believed to be holding Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. To Miller's surprise, the warehouse is not secure, with looters making their way in and out as soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division sporadically fight the Iraqis. But they find that the warehouse is empty. At a debriefing, Miller brings up the point that the majority of the intel given to him is inaccurate and anonymous, stating that on his last three attempts to find WMDs, his team had come up with nothing. High-ranking officials quickly dismiss Miller's theory about the intelligence being false. After the debriefing, Miller meets Martin Brown , a CIA officer based in the Middle East who tells Miller that the next place he is going to investigate for WMDs is also empty, as a UN team had already searched there two months ago. Meanwhile, Clark Poundstone  is welcoming an Iraqi politician named Ahmed Zubaidi  at the Baghdad International Airport, where he is questioned by a journalist named Lawrie Dayne . Because of global pressure about the WMD intel not materializing, she says she needs to speak directly to ""Magellan,"" to which Poundstone brushes her off. While investigating another site, Miller is approached by the Iraqi who calls himself ""Freddy"" , who tells him that he saw some Ba'ath Party VIPs meeting in a nearby home. Miller and his men swiftly arrive and burst into the house. Al-Rawi narrowly escapes, but one of his henchmen is taken into custody. Before Miller can extract any more information, the man is grabbed by special operations personnel. Dayne finds Poundstone again and complains, but he maintains his dismissive posture, justifying that the stakes are much larger than her role in selling newspapers. Miller goes to Brown's hotel in the Green Zone and tells him what happened. Brown arranges for Miller to visit the man removed from his custody by the special operations personnel. Before leaving, he is approached by Dayne. Miller soon finds the Iraqi informant in prison. Near death after being tortured, the man responds to Miller's question with one word: ""Jordan."" Miller goes to Dayne's hotel room to confront her about the bogus intel she published, but she refuses to disclose her source. He continues to press her about what she knows. She reluctantly confirms that her source had met with Magellan in Jordan. With Brown's help, Miller's suspicions are confirmed that Al-Rawi met with Poundstone in February in Jordan as Poundstone's informant. Miller realizes that Poundstone probably wants to prevent Al-Rawi from disclosing the fact that he had never confirmed the presence of WMDs. When Miller tries to meet with Al-Rawi to encourage him to turn himself in before he is killed by Poundstone's men, he is kidnapped by Al-Rawi's men because Poundstone had just announced the decision to disband the entire Iraqi army. Al-Rawi tells Miller that he told Poundstone there had been no WMD program since the First Persian Gulf War; Poundstone was being used as a tool by his superiors in Washington so that Iraq would be invaded. American forces commence an attack on Al-Rawi's positions and the general flees. Meanwhile, Miller kills his captor and races to capture Al-Rawi. When he finally manages to catch up with him, Freddy suddenly appears and kills Al-Rawi. Miller tells Freddy to escape before the area is secured by troops as many of the Iraqi insurgency desperately tries to hold off the American forces before being overwhelmed by their air support. Later, in his hotel suite, Miller writes a report of everything that happened. Miller confronts Poundstone in a meeting and gives him the report. Poundstone tells Miller that WMDs do not matter. Poundstone then rejoins the Iraqi meeting, only to see the Iraqi factional leaders yelling at each other and leaving the meeting. Afterwards, Dayne receives an emailed copy of Miller's report. Miller had relayed the information to all major news agencies around the world.war soldier iraq war weapon of mass destruction baghdad iraqi  near east",False,tt0947810,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,94882889,1,0,-0.05393080937912841,-2.2977368060284267,69948875.8367347,107775406.44897959,35943375.76923077,65951068.07692308,51928897.85714286,81786040.71428572,17316267.0,5,105316267.0,1.0,,0.0,,,145838025.44444445,14.0,213504692.1111111,9.0,,0.0,,,14366430.0,13.0,83116430.0,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,204931766.0,244931766.0,1.0,142238607.33333334,237238607.33333334,3.0,,,,163064122.33333334,274730789.0,3.0,7650767.5,50150767.5,2.0,,,,61286096.0,76286096.0,1.0,,,,2881496.3333333335,50103718.55555555,9.0,65142626.0,103142626.0,6.0,61286096.0,76286096.0,1.0,81643048.0,102643048.0,2.0,,,,44709141.0,95709141.0,6.0,65560026.0,135560026.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,61286096.0,76286096.0,1.0,,,,,,,39060083.0,107660083.0,5.0,38837557.0,49587557.0,2.0,24111229.25,54986229.25,4.0,,,,,,133979129.7037037,59173574.14814815,4.0,4.666666666666667,102557850.13709407

Dave, an avid comic book fan, is bitter that people do not intervene when a crime is being committed. He purchases a bodysuit and, after making modifications, embarks on a campaign to become a real-life superhero, despite having no superpowers or skills. After his first crime-fighting encounter leads to him getting stabbed and getting run over in a hit and run, leaving him with permanent nerve damage, he gains an enhanced capacity to endure pain, and surgical implants required to repair multiple skeletal fractures give him resistance to further bone-crushing injuries. His effort to conceal the truth, claiming he had had his clothes thrown off after being mugged, leads to rumors that he is gay. His longtime crush, Katie Deauxma  immediately attempts to become his friend, having always wanted a ""gay BFF""; Dave hesitantly goes along with it. After intervening in a gang attack, Dave's actions are recorded by a bystander and put on the internet, turning him into a celebrity. Calling himself ""Kick-Ass"", he sets up a MySpace account so he can be contacted for help. After responding to a request from Katie, he deals with a drug dealer, Rasul, who has been harassing her. Rasul and his thugs quickly overpower him, but he is rescued by eleven-year-old vigilante Hit-Girl , who kills Rasul first, and then kills all of Rasul's thugs and leaves with her father, Big Daddy . They believe he has potential, but warn him to be more careful, and give him a way to contact them if needed. Big Daddy is Damon Macready, a former cop who has a long-standing grudge against crime boss Frank D'Amico  for framing him as a drug dealer, leading to the suicide of his wife. His former partner at the New York Police Department, Marcus Williams , became guardian to his daughter, Mindy. Big Daddy, however, has reclaimed Mindy and is training her to be a skilled crime-fighter, against Marcus' wishes, hoping to take down D'Amico, sabotaging his organization. However, Big Daddy's actions inadvertently made D'Amico target Kick-Ass instead, believing that it was the latter that killed his men. D'Amico's son, Chris , suggests a different approach. He assumes the role of the vigilante ""Red Mist"" in order to befriend Kick-Ass and lure him into a trap. The attempted ambush is undone by Big Daddy, who independently kills D'Amico's men and sets the building on fire. Following his escape from the warehouse fire, Dave decides to quit being Kick-Ass. He confesses the truth to Katie, and she forgives him and becomes his girlfriend. A week later, after finding a number of messages from Red Mist urgently requesting they meet, Dave decides to don his Kick-Ass costume one last time. At the meeting, Red Mist creates a ruse that both he and Kick-Ass have a bounty placed on both of their heads. Believing the story, Kick-Ass calls his allies, unwittingly leading Big Daddy and Hit-Girl into an ambush. Upon arriving at one of Big Daddy's safe houses, Red Mist shoots Hit-Girl out of a window, and D'Amico's men storm the place, capture Big Daddy, taking Kick-Ass with them. D'Amico intends to have his thugs torture and execute his captives in a live Internet broadcast viewed by millions, including Katie and Marcus, who can only watch helplessly. Hit-Girl, having survived the shooting, storms the hideout, killing all of the gangsters; but during the struggle, one thug sets Big Daddy on fire, fatally burning him. He and Hit-Girl share a tearful farewell before he dies. Kick-Ass tries to convince Hit-Girl to quit her dangerous lifestyle, but she plans to finish what her father started, and Kick-Ass agrees to help. Hit-Girl infiltrates D'Amico's headquarters, pretending she lost her parents, kills the lobby guards and makes her way upstairs. Arriving at D'Amico's penthouse, she proceeds to kill every henchman in her path. She runs out of bullets at the end when Kick-Ass arrives on a jet pack fitted with miniguns that Big Daddy had previously acquired, and kills the remaining thugs. Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl then take on D'Amico and his son. While Kick-Ass fights Red Mist in the training room and the two manage to knock each other unconscious, Hit-Girl is overpowered by D'Amico  after a vicious fight and lies helpless as he prepares to kill her. As D'Amico aims his gun, Kick-Ass comes around and, armed with a bazooka that D'Amico's bodyguard had taken from Big Daddy's safehouse, comes to her aid, blasting D'Amico out of the window where he explodes in mid-air. Red Mist revives in time to see Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl leaving on the jet pack, and is powerless to stop them. Mindy and Dave retire from crime fighting to live a more normal life, and Mindy returns to live with Marcus, and enrolls at Dave's school. Dave has been told to look after Mindy, ""not that she needs it"". Dave explains that although he is done with crime fighting, a new ""generation"" of superheroes have been inspired by his endeavor, and the city is safer as a result. Red Mist is shown donning a new mask as he quotes Jack Nicholson as the Joker, ""As a great man once said, 'Wait till they get a load of me'.""<ref name 16 April 2010 | first  Ditzian | title  http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1637258/20100416/story.jhtml |publisherViacom | archiveurl  23 January 2011 }}crime fighter secret identity comic book superhero based on comic murder mafia teenager violence realism rookie adaptation young adult kickass",False,tt1250777,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,96188903,0,0,2.4353179642857143,-2.2977368060284267,24646662.333333332,52579995.666666664,20763271.5,38263271.5,,,,0,,,61954311.0,0.0,76954311.0,1.0,,0.0,,,55279628.5,9.0,108779628.5,2.0,72315871.875,14.0,121053371.875,8.0,,0.0,,,-1173477.0,24.0,2826523.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-5185211.0,6814789.0,1.0,29353944.2,47623944.2,5.0,,,,,,,95226821.8,157426821.8,5.0,12795683.0,28295683.0,4.0,35455120.0,73705120.0,2.0,380334263.25,479459263.25,8.0,161314939.54545453,242587666.8181818,11.0,65560026.0,135560026.0,1.0,,,,,,,113143854.875,181206354.875,8.0,37591105.0,95591105.0,7.0,30221457.5,115221457.5,2.0,,,,,,,65560026.0,135560026.0,1.0,,,,-9401355.0,598645.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,17622718.25,58747718.25,4.0,,,,-9401355.0,598645.0,1.0,,,77403458.59375,47094083.59375,5.875,3.0,102557850.13709407

I am a soldier of Rome, and this is neither the beginning, nor the end of my story."" It is AD 117 and the Roman garrisons are struggling to conquer the Picts, who inhabit the Scottish Highlands and a large part of the rest of Scotland. Centurion Quintus Dias is the only survivor of a Pictish raid on a Roman garrison and is taken prisoner by Vortix. Agricola, the Roman governor of Britannia, wants to obtain favour with the Roman Senate, hoping to secure a transfer back to the comforts of Rome. He dispatches the Ninth Legion, under General Titus Flavius Virilus, to eradicate the Pictish threat and provides him with a Brigantian scout called Etain. As the legion marches north they encounter Dias and rescue him from three of Gorlacon's men. Dias tells Virilus of his encounter with Gorlacon and the general discovers that Dias' father was a famous gladiator that he had seen fight. Dias befriends two Roman officers, a veteran named Bothos and a young Roman soldier named Thax. Etain betrays the legion to Gorlacon, leading them into a trap where they are annihilated. The general is captured, while Dias, Bothos, and Thax survive, along with four others: ""Brick""; two Greco-Roman legionaries named Macros and Leonidas; and Tarak, a cook from the Hindu Kush. They set out to rescue general Virilus and, after a few days' travel, they find him and sneak in at nightfall. Failing to break his chains, he orders them to leave him and get back to Roman territory. As they retreat, Thax kills Gorlacon's young son and recovers Virilus' helmet. The next morning the general is given a sword and made to duel with Etain, who kills him. The seven plan to travel north  in order to throw the Picts off their trail, then head west, and then south. Meanwhile, Etain, Aeron, Vortix and a detachment of seven Pictish warriors are sent to kill them. After several days' pursuit they catch up with the fugitives, who jump off a cliff into a river. Tarak is killed before he can jump, Macros and Thax become separated from the others and see a wolf close-by. Dias and his group camp for the night, while their trackers set up camp nearby. Dias and Brick launch a night raid on the enemy camp, killing two men and severely wounding a third, but cannot find Etain. Dias learns of the death of Gorlacon's son, and that the king has sworn vengeance on their heads. Etain is absent, as she has launched her own attack on the Roman's campsite. Dias and Brick return to their camp, only to discover that Leonidas has been killed and Bothos injured. Macros and Thax are running from a wolf pack. Thax falls, with the wolves in close pursuit, and cries out to his comrade for help. Macros returns to help him and Thax slices through Macros' hamstrings to prevent him from standing, allowing Thax to escape while the wolves attack and devour Macros. Dias, Bothos and Brick find a hut in the forest where they befriend Arianne, a Pict exile accused of witchcraft. She shelters them, provides food and medical attention. When Etain comes the following day, Arianne confronts her while the Romans hide in her grain store under the floorboards. The next morning they leave Arianne, who provides them with enough food to travel to a nearby Roman garrison. They find the garrison abandoned, an order pinned to a post says that the Roman troops have retreated south, by the orders of Emperor Hadrian. As they see Etain and her group of Picts approach, they set up a defensive position inside the fort. Bothos kills Vortix and a female warrior, Dias kills two Picts, and Brick kills Aeron and the last Pict warrior; however, before the Picts are defeated, Brick is killed by a spear thrown by Etain who Dias then kills. Dias and Bothos continue southwards and are reunited with Thax. Upon reaching Hadrian's Wall, Thax threatens Dias and they fight, with Dias killing Thax. Bothos, joyfully riding towards the Romans, is mistaken for a Pict and shot by an archer. When Dias enters the camp he reports to governor Agricola, who is concerned that news of the Legion's annihilation may cause other tribes to rise up against them. He is also fearful of his record being tainted by a military failure, and decides that the Ninth Legion's fate should remain a mystery and Dias must be killed. Dias manages to foil the attempt on his life, though he is grievously wounded in the thigh during the fracas, and Agricola's daughter tells him that he is too much of a risk. He escapes the camp and returns to Arianne in the forest. As the weakened Dias lies in her arms by the stream, he and Arianne kiss. The film ends with Quintus Dias adjusting the narrative of the film's opening line, ""My name is Quintus Dias. I am a fugitive of Rome, and this is neither the beginning, nor the end of my story.""roman empire ancient rome ancient world violence britain behind enemy lines sole survivor 2nd century hadrian’s wall",False,tt1020558,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,6814789,1,0,-0.7608762354931312,-2.2977368060284267,-5192534.0,25307466.0,592211.7333333333,13584211.733333332,362910544.0,377910544.0,826112.5,2,3326112.5,2.0,386090727.0,2.0,586090727.0,1.0,24990297.0,4.0,73323630.33333333,3.0,4274588.333333333,14.0,11207921.666666666,3.0,32169884.0,3.0,82169884.0,1.0,49238440.0,3.0,64238440.0,1.0,10161391.0,1.0,60161391.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,-3121109.0,31878891.0,1.0,43238847.666666664,73238847.66666667,3.0,,,,,,,18789314.333333332,35455981.0,3.0,-7788574.0,22211426.0,1.0,44822796.0,64822796.0,1.0,168006359.58333334,235036359.58333334,12.0,,,,23000000.0,33000000.0,1.0,,,,25545104.75,48045104.75,4.0,2294373.0,4294373.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-2747100.5,13252899.5,2.0,25546556.0,43306325.0,1.0,-7788574.0,22211426.0,1.0,,,,-7788574.0,22211426.0,1.0,,,,96684394.5,164934394.5,4.0,,,125788300.92857143,72535919.97619048,3.625,1.7142857142857142,102557850.13709407

Port Moresby  and his wife Kit  are accompanied by their friend George Tunner  on a trip that will take them deep into the Sahara Desert. Tunner observes, ""We're probably the first tourists they've had since the war"" to which Kit replies, ""We're not tourists. We're travelers."" While Tunner plans to return home in a few weeks, Port and Kit plan on staying for a year or two. While awaiting transport to a hotel, the group meets the Lyles – Mrs. Lyle ([[Jill Bennett , a travel writer and her son Eric . After arriving at the hotel, Port invites Kit to accompany him for a walk of the city. After refusing and rebuffing his romantic advances, Port angrily leaves. During his walk he meets a prostitute . The two have sex and the prostitute attempts to steal his wallet. Port quickly leaves and is chased by a mob. The next morning Tunner arrives at Kit's room to take her shopping. Not wanting Tunner to know that Port stayed out all night, she removes the covers from his bed to make it appear that he slept there. As Kit and Tunner are preparing to leave, a disheveled Port arrives. Seeing his bed, he assumes that Tunner spent the night with Kit. Port and Kit once again encounter the Lyles and are offered a ride in their car to their next destination but are informed that there is no room for Tunner. Port accepts the ride with the Lyles while Kit takes the train with Tunner. Tunner and Kit awake the next morning in Kit's room after a drunken tryst. Suspicious of Kit's relationship with Tunner, Port arranges for Eric Lyle to provide Tunner with transportation to Messad on the pretext that Port and Kit will meet him later. Eric agrees but also steals Port's passport. In Bounoura, Port discovers his passport missing. Even after being informed by local officials that the passport can be recovered in Messad, Port decides to proceed to El Ga'a with Kit in order to avoid a meeting with Tunner. Port then contracts typhoid and dies at a French foreign legion post leaving Kit alone deep in the Sahara. Kit wanders in the desert until she is rescued by a caravan led by Belqassim . After the caravan arrives at Belqassim's home, he disguises Kit as a boy and locks her in a guest house. Although held captive, Kit welcomes Belqassim's advances and the two begin an affair. Kit is soon discovered by Belqassim's wives who order her to leave. Kit finds herself disoriented in the local marketplace and is found in a hospital by staff of the American embassy. She is transported back to Tangier where she began her journey and is told that Tunner is waiting for her.

Larry has been plagued with on-air panic attacks and speech impediments lately since he proposed to Vickie. Vickie thinks it's just pre-wedding jitters, but his affliction could get them both fired. Larry's uncle, Dr. Paul Abbot, decides that Larry needs to be cured of his neurotic speech defect and exaggerated panic attacks. Paul decides to treat him with a form of shock therapy to ""scare him to death"" in much the same way someone might try to startle someone out of hiccups. Larry chooses the castle-like mansion located in rural upstate New York in which he grew up as the site for their wedding. There, Vickie gets to meet Larry's eccentric family: great-aunt Kate , who plans to leave all her money to Larry; his uncle, Francis; and Larry's cousins, Charles, Nora, Susan, and the cross-dressing Francis Jr. Also present are the estate's butler, Pfister, and his wife, Rachel, the maid; Sylvia, Larry's old girlfriend who is now married to Charles; and Susan's magician husband, Montego the Magnificent. Paul decides this is the perfect opportunity to set his plan to ""cure"" Larry in motion and he gets the other family members in on the plan. Unfortunately for all of them, something else more sinister and unexpected is lurking at the Abbot Estates.

The film touches on many subjects from the futility of politics, the confusion of loosely strung government conspiracies, and the chaos created by both anarchy and Nineteen Eighty-Four-styled totalitarianism. It further reflects on life, dreams, and God's place in a seemingly increasingly chaotic world. In some ways, the film is political: it describes how Fate sees the political landscape  but at the same time Fate makes it clear that he ""was always a singer and maybe no more than that"". He produces no solutions to any of the problems the film presents.

She lives on an East London council estate with her single mother, Joanne, and younger sister, Tyler, and is highly antagonistic toward both of them. Mia is a loner, appearing to have had a falling out with her best friend Keely. She provokes Keely's other friends and head butts another girl when Mia criticizes their dance routine. Mia regularly practises hip-hop dance alone in a deserted flat. Near the estate, Mia comes across a skinny, tethered horse in a traveller encampment. She tries to free it, only to be caught, taunted, and assaulted by two young men, the horse's owners. A third young man, Billy, the brother of the other two, is more sympathetic. He explains that the horse is ill and he befriends Mia. Joanne's new boyfriend, Connor O'Reily, is a charming and handsome Irishman. He drives Joanne, Mia, and Tyler on a day-trip into the countryside. He is eager to get along with both of Joanne's daughters. He introduces them to his favorite song, Bobby Womack's version of ""California Dreamin'"", shows Mia how to catch a fish using noodling, and asks her to show off her dance moves. Although Mia is abrupt with Connor, she also appears to be intrigued by him. Later when Mia attends a shop to use the Internet, she watches a dance video. She sees the girls from earlier in the movie and angrily confronts them again. One night, she secretly watches him and her mother having sex. She then goes back to her room and slams the door several times. Mia finds a flyer for a club seeking dancers and Connor encourages Mia to apply. He lends her a video camera to record an audition tape. Mia sends in her tape and is invited by the club to perform in person. Late one night, after she and Connor have both been drinking, he asks to see her dance routine. She dances to ""California Dreamin'"". Connor then invites her to sit next to him, and the two end up having sex in the living room while Joanne is passed out drunk upstairs. Connor suggests that Mia has already had sex with Billy, and tells Mia to keep their liaison a secret. The following morning, Mia hears her mother crying: Tyler tells her that Connor has left. Mia tracks him down to his home in Chadwell St Mary and confronts him. He explains he cannot see Joanne or Mia any more. He drives her to Tilbury Town railway station and gives her her fare home. Instead, Mia makes her way back to Connor's house. It is unoccupied, so Mia sneaks in through an unlocked back window. She finds Connor's camera in the living room and, watching his videos, discovers that he has a wife and young daughter, Keira. Shocked and upset, Mia urinates on the living room floor and then goes upstairs to wash her face. She hears Connor and his wife returning, and escapes by sneaking out of the back door. Back in the road in front of the house, Mia sees Keira riding her scooter. On impulse, she pressures Keira to go with her under the claim that Keira's mother told Mia to take her for ice cream. They then go out into the fields and eventually reach the River Thames, where a suspicious Keira tries to escape. Mia catches her, but in the struggle Keira falls into the turbulent river water and disappears. She resurfaces after several seconds and Mia pulls her out, then takes her home as night falls. When they reach Connor's house, Mia sends Keira to her house then sneaks away, but as she is walking back towards the train station, Connor's car screeches to a halt beside her. Mia attempts to run away, but Connor chases her, catches up with her, and slaps her, knocking her to the ground. He then walks away and drives off without saying a word. The next day, Mia goes to her audition. It is immediately obvious that it is for erotic dancers: the other participants are all grown women wearing heavy makeup and provocative clothing. Mia takes the stage, but as the music starts, and before she has begun dancing, she walks off. Mia goes in search of Billy. When she arrives at his place, Billy tells her that the horse has died. Mia sinks to the ground, weeping. Billy says he is moving to Cardiff, Wales, and invites her to join him. Mia returns home to pack. In the living room, Joanne is in an almost trance-like state, dancing to Mia's Nas CD. Mia tells Joanne that she is leaving. Before she goes, Mia, Joanne, and Tyler dance to ""Life's a Bitch"" from the album Illmatic. Outside, Mia hugs Tyler goodbye and gets into Billy's car, setting off for her new life in Wales.mother alcohol adultery fight sister friendship party school teenager theft violence apartment estate boyfriend teenage rebellion woman director aggressive mother daughter relationship",True,tt1232776,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,2357852,0,0,-0.2723444898153065,39.7198236153607,10038960.05263158,24926316.315789472,-185376.16666666666,14487957.166666666,,,,0,,,2294373.0,1.0,4294373.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,2502141.0,2.0,8902141.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9172131.125,27517102.25,8.0,,,,,,,,,,32425288.5,46925288.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6598257.0,2398257.0,0.375,1.0,151278235.71911615

Circumstances conspire against him, and he is forced into a job as a stonemason and an unhappy marriage to a country girl, Arabella . He remains true to his dream and, months later, after his wife's sudden departure, he heads for the city. He thinks education is available for any man who is willing to work hard. There he encounters his cousin, Sue Bridehead , who is beautiful and intelligent, and shares his disdain for convention. Whilst Jude is enraptured by Sue, she decides to marry Jude's former school teacher, Phillotson , after Jude tells her he is married to Arabella. Meanwhile, Jude is rejected for the university based primarily on his lower-class status. The marriage of Sue and Phillotson is not a success, as she refuses to give herself sexually or romantically to her husband. She leaves Phillotson to join Jude in what turns out to be a rough life, moving from place to place as Jude picks up occasional work as a stonemason. The two are in love and, over the course of years, Sue gives birth to several children. Agnostic and independent, she refuses to legalize their arrangement by marriage. Jude learns that Arabella bore a son, which she named Jude  soon after she left Jude. The boy comes to live with his father Jude, Sue and his half-siblings. Sue and Jude are forbidden a permanent rental lodging because their living arrangement without marriage is considered scandalous. Sue tells Juey that the family cannot stay long at their present lodging because there are too many of them. The next day Sue and Jude return to their lodging to find that Juey has killed his half-siblings and committed suicide, hanging himself. His suicide note says the reason: ""Becos we were to menny."" Each of the couple falls into a deep depression after the deaths of their children. Turning to the religion she previously rejected, Sue comes to believe that God has judged and punished the couple for not having married. She decides to return to Phillotson, although she finds him sexually repugnant, as he is her true husband in the eyes of God. A year after the death of their children, Jude and Sue happen to meet when separately visiting the tombstones of their children. They both look worse for wear.

He became an alcoholic as a result, and his only friend is his faithful Sergeant, Triand . Foster arrives in Paris to assume a new command: to return to the Rif  to re-establish French authority, as Bedouin and Berber tribes have begun to revolt against French rule. Foster is also ordered to escort archeologists from the Louvre, who are uncovering an ancient city near Erfoud buried by a sand storm 3,000 years ago. The site is the final resting place of a Berber saint, ""The Angel of the Desert"". Foster was chosen for the assignment, as he is the only French officer alive who served in Morocco before the war. He had helped to develop diplomatic ties with the tribes, especially with El Krim, the de facto leader of the scattered Rif tribes. Foster had vowed to El Krim that there would be no further archeological excavations. Foster’s force is assembled. Among those who volunteer, willingly or unwillingly, is ""the Gypsy"" Marco Segrain , a charming jewel thief famous for a three-year crime spree on the Riviera until French authorities managed to apprehend him. Gypsy befriends three other recruits: the Russian giant Ivan , formerly a member of the elite bodyguard of the deposed Russian Imperial family; “Top Hat” Gilbert Francis , a fashionable man and musician who lacks the physical traits needed in a soldier; and Fredrick Hastings , a romantic young English aristocrat who missed the Great War. The four friends are soon disillusioned by the harsh realities of life in the Legion. A fatal fight breaks out among the men while traveling to Morocco over a homophobic insult to Maj. Foster's honor, to which Sgt. Triand takes exception. Foster does not hesitate to harshly discipline his men, especially Marco, who frequently disobeys orders, though he does care for his men. During the voyage, Marco charms Mme. Picard , daughter of a murdered archaeologist. During their land journey to the Legion fortress, the train carrying the Legionnaires and the archaeological team is stopped by El Krim  and his men. El Krim greets his old friend Foster but also declares that he is determined to unite the Berber tribes to drive the French out of Morocco. El Krim gives a ""gift"" to Foster to take back to the Premier of France: the archeologists of an earlier dig, who have been blinded and whose tongues have been cut out. He warns Foster not continue the excavation. Training in the desert is so harsh, it pushes Top Hat to the point of suicide. Later, at the digging site, Hastings is kidnapped while on guard duty and tortured to death by one of El Krim’s men, whom El Krim excuses as being merely over-zealous. Marco retaliates. Instead of disciplining him, Foster merely defends him, using El Krim’s previous excuse for the actions of his own man. Eventually, the tomb of the Angel of the Desert is found, and her golden sarcophagus is excavated. Foster offers it to El Krim as a token of peace, but El Krim rallies the warriors of all Bedouin tribes to fight a climactic battle. With the Legionnaires being heavily outnumbered, the digging site is eventually overrun. Ivan is killed, but Marco fights on, single-handedly fending off a flank attack. When Foster is killed, El Krim immediately calls off the fight, sending the surviving Legionnaires “to tell the world what happened” and out of respect for his dead friend. There are two endings: the TV version ends with Marco taking up Mme Picard's offer to desert. The theatrical ending shows Marco  staying behind and training more Legionnaire recruits, welcoming them by reiterating Foster's warning: ""If the desert doesn't get you, the Arabs will. If the Arabs don't get you, the Legion will. And if the Legion doesn't, then I will. I don't know which is worse.""gypsy morocco foreign legion sahara post world war i desert archaeologist tribal warfare archaeological dig desert warfare tribal chief buried tomb",False,tt0076175,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1000000,0,0,-6.0,16.09921713605479,,,,,,,28750000.0,0,50750000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,3000000.0,1.0,8000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,77926874.0,90926874.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,38840770.75,47165770.75,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16694500.0,23294500.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,29375000.0,15875000.0,0.125,1.0,77361929.38708472

Miss Lily Bart is young, witty and beautiful. Along with her quiet cousin, Grace Stepney, she lives with her wealthy aunt, Julia Peniston. Lily, a socialite raised in comfort and always admired, soon learns that there are bitter consequences for a single woman without wealth trapped in an uncaring society. Lily's closest friend is Mr. Lawrence Selden, a lawyer. Relaxing at his flat, she teasingly points out how seldom he comes to see her. He gently reminds her that he is not a good catch, i.e. not rich enough for her to marry. When she leaves his apartment, she runs into wealthy Simon Rosedale, who is instantly smitten with her. On the train to Bellomont, she invites Mr. Percy Gryce to sit next to her. Another acquaintance, Mrs. Bertha Dorset, takes the seat next to Lily. Lily is encouraged by her good friend Judy Trenor to pursue wealthy but dull Percy Gryce. Lily and Mr. Gryce arrange a date for the next morning to go to church, but Lily misses it on purpose; she waits in the park for Mr. Selden. They take a walk, and while chatting dreamily about love and marriage they forget all caution and kiss. Mr. Gryce has been watching and leaves abruptly because of Lily’s behavior. A dejected Lily pours out her troubles to Judy's husband, Gus Trenor, and he agrees to help her make money through an investment. Later, Lily innocently comes across some scandalous letters Bertha Dorset wrote that reveal Selden was her lover. Lily is hurt and disillusioned but keeps the letters a secret. At a wedding, Lily receives a 5,000 check from Gus Trenor, who claims to have also reinvested another 4,000. He wants to see her alone, but she suggests he see her at her aunt’s house. He invites Lily to the opera, where she also meets Lawrence Selden and Simon Rosedale. Late that night, Selden tells Lily that he loves her. They kiss, but Gus Trenor is watching them. Later, Lily goes to the opera with Gus Trenor and Sim Rosedale. Lily later leaves with Gus, but he lures her into his home and tries to kiss her. Lily flees but she still owes Gus money, over 9,000 dollars. At home, Aunt Julia tells Lily she won’t give her any more money and how much she disapproves of Lily’s behavior. Lily is devastated. Lily longs for Lawrence Selden to come to her. Instead loud, coarse Simon Rosedale comes to call. He has been eyeing her for quite some time. His wealth could free Lily from danger, yet his marriage proposal makes her shudder with disgust. Later that day, Bertha Dorset invites Lily to the Dorsets' yacht for a cruise in the Mediterranean. Lily is desperate to escape New York, the whispers and the constant criticism. Bertha slyly describes the tranquil cruise in glowing terms, with a French chef, a masseuse, and every conceivable form of luxury. Tempted by images of tranquility and bliss, Lily gives in and agrees to go. In Monte Carlo, Mrs. Carry Fisher meets Lawrence Selden, who just arrived from London. They are both very worried about Lily. Meanwhile Lily herself is having a massage on the yacht, her eyes growing heavy, while George Dorset is snoring nearby. A young man is reading French poetry to Bertha. The two of them soon slip away together. Hours later, Lily and George awake and look for them in vain. Next morning, an angry George enters Lily’s cabin, blaming her for everything. When Bertha finally arrives, Lily confronts her, but Bertha viciously accuses Lily of adultery with George. Lawrence Selden arrives on the scene and is shocked. Lily is barred from returning to the yacht. Back in New York, Aunt Julia has died. Lily is cut out of her will in favor of mousy little Cousin Grace. A dazed Lily is now homeless and adrift. Carry Fisher invites her to stay with her and the Gormers for the summer at her house. Carry believes Lily must get married, and there are two only two possibilities left, George Dorset and Sim Rosedale. Vengeful George asks Lily to tell the truth about his wife Bertha, since Lily witnessed what happened on the cruise, but she denies any knowledge. Simon Rosedale knows about Bertha’s letters and advises Lily to use them against Bertha. He offers to marry Lily once Bertha has been disgraced, but Lily refuses. Lily goes to work for Mrs. Hatch as her social secretary. Selden gently tells Lily this isn’t appropriate, but she defends herself saying she needs the money. Lily frequently goes to the pharmacy to get Mrs. Hatch’s sleeping medication, and after a while begins taking it herself. After Mrs. Hatch fires Lily, Lily takes up millinery piece work, but gets fired because she works too slowly and poorly. Lily goes to see Grace Stepney and asks for a loan, but is coldly rejected. When Sim Rosedale invites Lily to tea, she tells him everything, but refuses his help because it would again put her in debt to a man. The next morning, Lily decides to confront Bertha Dorset with those letters she once wrote to Mr. Selden, but finds that the Dorsets have left town. Lily goes to Lawrence Selden and breaks down desperately, telling him she knows she lost his love. When Lawrence isn’t looking, she throws the letters in the fire. Lily goes home and receives an envelope containing her inheritance at last. She writes two checks, one for the bank, the other one for Gus Trenor, and takes the sleeping medicine once again. She lies down in bed, loses consciousness and dies. Selden discovers the burnt letters in his fireplace, but when he hurries to Lily’s apartment, he finds her and cries at her deathbed, telling her he loves her.new york city based on novel or book despair loneliness socialite high society early 1900s",False,tt0200720,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,5164404,0,0,-0.936331859397522,-1.1627692044360227,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23859445.5,29809445.5,2.0,,,,15787233.0,21787233.0,1.0,,,,41965829.0,47915829.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,76394553.2193505

Harry is late to see her before she dies because he is too scared to take the quicker underpass route, where a gang resides. After her funeral, Len confides in Harry that he is being terrorised by some youths and shows Harry an old bayonet he now carries to defend himself, citing that the police would not help him and he plans on taking justice into his own hands. The next day, Harry is visited by Detective Inspector Alice Frampton and Detective Sergeant Terence ""Terry"" Hicock, who tell him that Len had been murdered by a local gang led by Noel Winters. After Len's funeral, Harry is held at knife-point by Dean Saunders, an addict and suspect in Len's murder, whom he stabs in self defence during a brief struggle. Frampton visits Harry again the following morning and informs him that because Len was killed with his own bayonet, any charges laid could be reduced to manslaughter on the basis of self-defence. Harry decides to take matters into his own hands; he follows a drug dealer named Kenny to a squalid den where he negotiates to buy a pistol. Inside, Harry finds Kenny and his associate, Stretch are also growing cannabis and are sexually abusing a currently overdosing girl to make pornography. When Harry suggests calling an ambulance for the girl, Stretch threatens Harry, and he kills the dealers in retaliation, before burning down their den and leaving with the girl and some firearms. After leaving the girl outside a hospital, Harry captures one of Noel's gang members named Marky, who is being sexually abused by Troy Martindale, a heroin kingpin. Harry shoots and kills Martindale and captures Marky, whom he tortures into revealing some mobile phone camera footage of Len's murder, proving the gang's aggressive involvement. Harry uses Marky to bait Noel and Carl, another gang member, into a gunfight in the underpass. Carl is killed by Harry, and Marky is killed in the crossfire between Harry and Noel. After Marky is killed, Noel flees the underpass, with Harry in pursuit, before Harry collapses due to an emphysema attack. Convinced that the recent gang deaths are related to a gang war rather than Harry, Police Superintendent Childs orders a major arrest operation on the estate, which then leads to a massive riot. Harry discharges himself from hospital to pursue Noel, which results in Frampton and Hicock being in a car crash when they attempt to stop him. Harry rescues them and takes them to a nearby pub, where Frampton warns Harry that Sidney ""Sid"" Rourke, the bartender, is actually Noel's uncle. Harry discovers that Sid had been hiding Noel, but his guard drops due to his emphysema, allowing Sid to take the gun and reveal that he plans on killing Harry and the officers to protect Noel. Frampton tries to call for backup, only to be stopped midway by Noel, who is told to strangle her after Sid suffocates an unconscious Hicock. After Harry draws a revolver and shoots Noel, Sid shoots and wounds Harry, only to be shot by Frampton's backup in the form of police snipers, which had picked up on her interrupted call. At a conference held after the riot, Superintendent Childs announces that Frampton and the late Hicock will be given medals for their work and sacrifice, and denies any evidence of vigilante involvement in the entire case, saying that any such suggestions are unhelpful. The final scene is of a recovered Harry walking towards the underpass, now free and safe to walk through.riot self-defense pub investigation vigilante murder hospital drug dealing violence widower loner subway tunnel army veteran",False,tt1289406,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,10329747,0,0,0.4150338356164384,39.7198236153607,35455120.0,73705120.0,-6795709.0,13204291.0,418102.0714285714,13816673.5,115744403.1111111,45,171633292.0,9.0,19110928.0,6.0,31244261.333333332,3.0,30857551.5,2.0,86857551.5,2.0,,0.0,,,4897009.0,13.0,11647009.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,18425025.0,69925025.0,2.0,,,,,,,292705272.0,320205272.0,2.0,182602458.5,191102458.5,2.0,,,,,,,110472435.33333333,170055768.66666666,6.0,-2200126.0,4199874.0,1.0,-11433389.0,566611.0,1.0,32414589.0,51984589.0,5.0,,,,,,,17242133.25,26492133.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,19533783.0,34533783.0,1.0,8920647.0,14170647.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,2502141.0,8902141.0,1.0,,,,5796544.0,8176544.0,1.0,,,75345528.45833333,42652472.902777776,8.25,4.0,151278235.71911615

When the German Army occupies the castle to control the Dinu Mountain Pass, Molasar is unwittingly unleashed from deep within the innermost recesses of the citadel by a pair of treasure-seeking soldiers and he consumes their life energy. A detachment of Einsatzkommandos then arrives to deal with what is thought to be partisan activity. The Einsatzkommandos' actions only fuel the demon's hunger for bloodshed and soon more troops begin to die in mysterious, gruesome ways. At the instigation of the local priest, the Germans retrieve a Jewish historian, Professor Theodore Cuza, from a death camp to decipher a mysterious message emblazoned on a wall of the keep. The demonic and, at this point, cloudlike Molasar saves the professor's daughter, Eva Cuza, from a sexual assault by two Einsatzkommandos and then enlists the aid of her grateful father to escape from the Keep. Cuza is also cured of his debilitating scleroderma by the touch of Molasar and therefore becomes doubly indebted to the malevolent entity. However, a mysterious stranger arrives to foil this plan. After a misguided and unsuccessful attempt by the professor to have the stranger stopped, the two supernatural beings engage in a confrontation in which the demon is weakened and drawn back into the innermost recesses, and the hero inevitably finds himself pulled in as well, his fate linked with the demon that was his destined foe to guard from ever escaping the Keep.nazi electronic music score demon ss",False,tt0085780,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,3661757,0,0,-0.6385576650771747,6.872979369498223,-3889987.0,14110013.0,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-23060577.0,939423.0,1.0,,,,,,,31415026.2,48315026.2,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,51926656.25,61901656.25,4.0,,,,55737889.0,77737889.0,1.0,,,,23967437.0,34967437.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,70929371.26798174

Reese wants to become a higher level agent with more responsibilities. As the result of a shortage of agents in France, he is assigned as a partner to special agent Charlie Wax . Reese's first test is to have Wax released from airport detention by the French Customs when Wax does not want to surrender the cans of his favorite energy drink. Despite the apparent triviality of an energy drink that Wax could probably purchase in Paris, Wax continues to verbally abuse French Customs until Reese places a Diplomatic Mail sticker on Wax's luggage containing the energy drink, which makes them immune from Customs and Quarantine requirements. Once in the car, Wax apologizes for his behavior while opening the tins and revealing the concealed pieces of his personal SIG Sauer, which he refers to as ""Mrs. Jones"". Wax explains that he has been sent to Paris to investigate a drug ring at least indirectly responsible for the death of a woman who happens to be the niece of the Secretary of Defense. During the investigation, Wax reveals that there was no overdose—their goal is to trace the money back to a circle of Pakistani terrorists. Evidence leads them to the terrorists, resulting in an armed confrontation in which most of the terrorists are neutralized. Wax and Reese learn that the terrorists plan to infiltrate the U.S. Embassy with explosives hidden beneath their burkas. As they collect evidence, they find photographs of Agent Reese pinned to a wall. Ultimately, Reese learns that the terrorists are targeting a summit meeting. Wax discovers that Reese's fiancee Caroline  is a ""sleeper"" agent who was assigned to infiltrate them. When confronted, Caroline shoots Reese in the shoulder and escapes through a window. A Volvo picks her up on the street below. Caroline attempts to detonate an explosive vest while the last remaining terrorist in the Volvo attacks a US motorcade traveling to the summit by speeding towards them, wired with explosives. Wax destroys the vehicle with an AT4 rocket launcher just in the nick of time. Reese finds Caroline at the summit and attempts to dissuade her from carrying out her mission by professing his love. She attempts to detonate her vest anyway and Reese is forced to kill her. As Wax leaves Paris, Reese escorts him to his plane. Wax offers a full-time partnership. The two play a game of chess on the tarmac, placing their handguns on a utility cart, Reese revealing that he is now carrying a Desert Eagle pistol and earning another modicum of admiration from his new partner. There are two John Travolta references in this film in conjunction with two movies made by him in the past, and one pertaining to a previous movie of Jonathan Rhys Meyers'. The first John Travolta reference is to the film ""Pulp Fiction"" when the Wax character makes a statement about his favorite food, a ""Royale with Cheese"" and the second one is from the movie ""The Experts"" when Wax sings the Carpenters song ""Close to You""  when he hears it on the radio. The Meyers reference is barely noticeable, and occurs when a gang member suggests Wax could snort cocaine off of Reese's butt. Meyers' character, ""Maxwell Demon"" does this in Meyers' early film, ""Velvet Goldmine.""paris, france cia undercover explosive pimp ambassador anti hero revelation french politician firearm deception car crash gang",False,tt1179034,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,52826594,1,0,0.015896038461538458,-2.2977368060284267,,,201830568.0,226830568.0,73111837.0,88611837.0,7233996.0,12,64733996.0,2.0,23420056.0,12.0,58336749.166666664,6.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,201830568.0,226830568.0,1.0,,,,201830568.0,226830568.0,1.0,201830568.0,226830568.0,1.0,78979549.0,108979549.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,201830568.0,226830568.0,1.0,103850840.5,138850840.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5871113.0,50871113.0,1.0,,,,-13633773.0,9366227.0,1.0,201830568.0,226830568.0,1.0,201830568.0,226830568.0,1.0,,,,217664583.5,325164583.5,2.0,,,61535372.58333333,15327026.0,3.0,4.0,102557850.13709407

Tiered dream within a dream strategies are used and dreamers awaken by a sudden kick or by dying in the dream. However, if the dreamer is the one who dies, the dream ""collapses"". Each extractor carries a totem, a personalized small object whose behavior is only predictable to its owner, that serves the purpose of identifying dream-state or reality. Cobb's totem is a spinning top that perpetually spins in the dream state. The extraction fails due to Mallorie ""Mal"" Cobb , Cobb's deceased wife, whose memory projection sabotages the mission. Saito later reveals, after Cobb's and Arthur's associate  sells them out, that he was in fact auditioning the team to perform the difficult act of inception: implanting an idea or thought into a person's subconscious while they are asleep. Saito wishes to break up the energy conglomerate of his ailing competitor Maurice Fischer, by planting this idea in his son and heir Robert Fischer  to disintegrate his father's company. Should Cobb succeed, Saito would use his influence to clear a murder charge against him, so he can return to the U.S. and his children. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: Eames, a conman and identity forger; Yusuf, a chemist who concocts the powerful sedative for a stable dream within a dream strategy; Ariadne, a young architecture student tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes; and Arthur. Saito accompanies so that he knows whether or not Cobb and his team succeeded in their mission. When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney and his body is flown back to Los Angeles, the team share the flight with Robert Fischer and Cobb sedates him, bringing him into the shared dream. At each stage, the member of the team generating the dream stays behind to initiate the kick, while the other members sleep within the dream to travel a level deeper. In the first level, Yusuf's rainy downtown dream, the team abducts Fischer. However Fischer's antibody-like trained subconscious projections attack and severely wound Saito. Eames temporarily takes the appearance of Fischer's godfather, Peter Browning, to suggest Fischer reconsider his father's will. Yusuf drives the team in a van as they are sedated into Arthur's dream, a hotel, where the team recruit Fischer, convincing him his kidnapping was orchestrated by Browning. In the third dream level, a snowy mountain fortress dreamed by Eames, Fischer is told they are in Browning's subconscious, but they are, in fact, really going deeper into Fischer's. Yusuf, under assault by trained projections, initiates his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, sending Arthur's dream world into zero-gravity and causing an avalanche in Eames' dream. Arthur is forced to improvise a new kick using an elevator that will be synchronized with the van hitting the water, while the team in Eames' dream races to finish the job before the new round of kicks. Unbeknownst to the rest of the team, due to the effects of heavy sedation and multi-layered dreaming, death during this mission will result in entering Limbo, unconstructed dream space where the dreamer could be trapped indefinitely. Elapsed time in each dream level is, on average, roughly twenty times greater than in the level above it; in Limbo, the deepest level of all, 24 hours of outer-world time would be experienced as about half a century there. Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he spent ""50 years"" with Mal in Limbo constructing a world out of their shared memories whilst seemingly growing old together. After waking back into our outermost world, however, Mal remained convinced she was still dreaming and committed suicide, trying to persuade Cobb to do so by retroactively incriminating him in her death. He subsequently fled the U.S. and left his children behind, ostensibly in the care of his father-in-law. Saito finally succumbs to his wounds, and Cobb's projection of Mal sabotages the plan by killing Fischer, sending them both into limbo.Want to understand Inception? Read the screenplay!. Retrieved October 23, 2010. Cobb and Ariadne enter limbo to find Fischer and Saito, while Eames remains on his dream level to set up a kick by rigging the fortress with explosives. Cobb confronts his projection of Mal, who tries to convince him to stay in limbo. Cobb refuses and confesses that he was responsible for Mal's suicide: having convinced her to leave limbo by using inception to plant the idea in her mind that the world they had been living in for 50 years was not real, and hence the need to kill themselves in order to return to the real world, once back in the real world she continued to believe dying would wake her. Mal attacks Cobb but Ariadne shoots her. Through his confession, Cobb attains catharsis and chooses to remain in limbo to search for Saito. Ariadne kicks Fischer off a balcony, bringing him back up to the mountain fortress, where he enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: that his father wishes him to be his own man and, accordingly, that splitting up the conglomerate might not be such a radical notion after all. All of the team members except Cobb and Saito ride the synchronized kicks back up to reality: Ariadne jumps off a balcony in limbo, Eames detonates the explosives in the fortress, Arthur blasts an elevator containing the team's sleeping bodies up an elevator shaft, and the van in Yusuf's dream hits the water. Saito, who is slowly dying on each level from the initial gun-shot wound, enters Limbo. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito and the two remember their arrangement, presumably killing themselves and awakening to outer-world reality on the airplane. Saito honors the arrangement and Cobb passes through U.S. customs once the plane lands in Los Angeles. Just before reuniting with his children, Cobb tests reality with his spinning top, but he turns away to greet his children before observing the results. As he plays with his children the camera pans to the spinning top for the final shot, at which point the film abruptly ends.paris, france spy philosophy hotel allegory dream virtual reality fistfight car crash rescue mission los angeles, california danger zero gravity imagination dream world idea subconscious",False,tt1375666,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,825532764,1,0,4.159579775,-2.2977368060284267,521888558.5,689388558.5,409800463.0,502303463.0,229430534.3846154,295707457.46153843,83882891.5,12,128882891.5,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,5039980.333333333,6.0,13283313.666666666,3.0,94000000.0,3.0,109000000.0,1.0,55246079.0,8.0,93329412.33333333,6.0,73111837.0,3.0,88611837.0,1.0,104472937.5,46.0,155502937.5,10.0,,,,238514957.125,348389957.125,8.0,819558444.0,1004558444.0,1.0,,,,819558444.0,1004558444.0,1.0,,,,347939866.3333333,459608533.0,3.0,819558444.0,1004558444.0,1.0,,,,,,,42482.0,48482.0,1.0,,,,346898923.3333333,460232256.6666667,3.0,,,,8900619.0,78900619.0,3.0,,,,171353001.0,371353001.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,273531464.0,383531464.0,1.0,,,,,,,386615762.6666667,518282429.3333333,3.0,,,,,,,,,98101732.0,69292287.55555555,9.75,4.166666666666667,102557850.13709407

While they are walking, Jack becomes alarmed by a single pair of footprints in the snow. His instincts kick in just as sniper gunshots ring out. As they dive for cover, a panicked and horrified Ingrid watches Jack pull a gun from his pocket. Jack quickly silences her questions and shoots the approaching sniper. Ingrid is almost in shock from the events. She begins to understand something is seriously wrong beyond the fact that she and Jack have just been attacked. As Jack begins to probe the murdered assassin's clothing for identification she asks him what he is doing. Jack knows his true identity is in jeopardy and that he cannot allow Ingrid to call the police. He instructs her to go into the house and make the call and with cold detachment, shoots her in the back as she runs past. Jack then tracks down a second assassin lurking in the snow and kills him. He flees to Rome and contacts a ""business associate"", his handler named Pavel . Pavel insists that Jack cannot stay in Rome, sends him to Castelvecchio  and tells him ""Don't make any friends, Jack."" Jack becomes nervous, and, disposing of the cell phone which Pavel had given him, goes to nearby Castel del Monte instead. Jack has been deeply shaken by the events in Sweden. As a contract killer for hire, his skills as an assassin have been a commodity he has coldly and stoically sold, but the murder of Ingrid, a friend in the wrong place at the wrong time, causes him great anguish. While in Abruzzo, Jack  contacts Pavel, who sets him up with another job. He meets with a woman, Mathilde , who wants him to build a custom-designed sniper rifle for an assassination. He also begins patronizing a prostitute, Clara  and they begin a relationship separate from her business duties. His considerable skills as a craftsman are on display as he fashions a custom sound suppressor for the gun out of spare parts and drive shaft bearings obtained at a local automotive garage and an attaché case for its concealment and transport. Jack meets with Mathilde to test the weapon, based on a Ruger Mini-14 .http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/American,_The Mathilde is impressed by the craftsmanship, but asks that Jack make a few more adjustments. Later, Jack realizes that he is being followed by an assassin from Sweden, whom he kills. Jack begins to be tormented by dreams of the events in Sweden and regret for having killed Ingrid to cover his true identity. His relationship with a local priest Father Benedetto  causes him to question his life choices and the emptiness of his life on the run. Both Mathilde and Clara notice Jack's association with butterflies, Mathilde by his expertise on endangered butterflies and Clara by his prominent tattoo. When Father Benedetto tells Jack he senses he lives in a special kind of hell...""a place without love"", Jack begins to allow himself to feel love for Clara and he begins to envision a life with her. Jack talks to Pavel one last time, asking how the Swedes have possibly found him. His paranoia grows to the point that even Clara comes under suspicion when Jack discovers a small pistol in her purse she keeps for protection. While on a picnic, he sees Clara reach into her bag and he retrieves a gun from inside the picnic basket. His eyes fill with despair that he might have to kill another woman he has been intimate with to cover his identity. Clara removes a tube of sunscreen from her bag and asks a greatly relieved ""Edward"" to put some on her back. In the car, Jack questions Clara about the gun and is satisfied with her explanation. She asks him to take her home with him. Jack refuses but his outward facade of the stone faced, cold blooded killer is crumbling. Jack agrees to deliver the weapon to Mathilde as his last job, but at the last moment he reopens the briefcase and modifies the rifle. At the drop-off, Jack becomes suspicious that Mathilde plans to kill him. Before anything can happen, a busload of school children arrives, and the two separate. While driving away, Mathilde is contacted by Pavel, who asks if she has killed Jack. She informs him she has not, but insists that she is following Jack and will kill him. In town, Clara meets Jack in the crowd at a local religious procession. Jack realizes his life as an assassin is over and that he has fallen deeply in love with Clara..He asks her to go away with him and she agrees. Mathilde attempts to assassinate Jack from a nearby rooftop, but the rifle backfires and explodes in her face due to Jack's adjustments. Seeing her fall from the roof, Jack shoves an envelope thick with cash from the gun deal into Clara's hands and tells Clara to go to a river where they previously picnicked and wait for him. He runs to Mathilde, who is dying on the pavement, and discovers she works for Pavel, the same as Jack does. As Jack goes to meet Clara, he notices that Pavel is following him. They exchange gunfire, and Pavel is killed. Jack doesn't realize he has been shot at first and he drives to meet Clara at the river. As his physical distress begins to alarm him, Jack feels his abdomen and blood soaked shirt realizing for the first time he has been injured. He pounds the steering wheel with a bloody fist in anger and despair. Jack arrives at the picnic spot and as he sees Clara, he collapses. Clara screams and runs to the car. A white, endangered butterfly flits skyward from Jack's car backlit by ethereal light filtering through the tall trees of the forest.

Tara  is an upper-caste princess while Maya  is her beautiful servant. The two girls are best friends until they get old enough for marriage. Tara is prepared to marry Prince Raj Singh , but Maya is forced into the role of the inferior servant. This culminates in an argument, where Tara reminds Maya of her low position in life. Resentful, Maya decides to take revenge when she chances on Raj alone. She sleeps with Raj, but unknown to both, Tara's hunchback brother, Prince Vikram aka Viki, hides and watches the two of them engage in sexual intercourse. He becomes crushed that his childhood infatuation slept with his brother-in-law. As Tara is leaving home as a newly-wedded bride to Raj, Maya tells her that just as Maya wore the princess's used clothes all her life, Tara will now have something Maya has used. To save Maya's honor, Viki sends a marriage proposal for her. When she refuses, he brands her as a whore, and she is forced to leave her home. Wandering on her own, she meets a young stone sculptor, Jai Kumar . Realizing she has nowhere to stay, Jai takes her to an older woman named Rasa Devi , who is a teacher of the Kama Sutra, the ancient art of seduction and making love. Maya begins a romantic relationship with Jai that is abruptly halted when he realizes he might not be able to work properly with Maya consuming his thoughts. Maya seeks comfort with Rasa Devi, making the decision to learn the courtesan's art. Raj, now the king, recognizes the visage as Maya's in one of Jai's sculptures. He dispatches his attendants to find Tara and succeeds. Maya is then delivered to the King as his new concubine. Soon after, Raj and Jai have a friendly wrestling competition, in which Jai wins but also gets the King's favor. Jai then learns of Maya's new status as favored concubine. In the meantime, the threat of an invading Shah inches closer. As Raj descends deeper into debauchery, he becomes irresponsible with his duties as King. He insults Viki sexually and for his hunchback. In retaliation, Viki writes a letter to the Shah to rid the kingdom of Raj, who now taxes the poor for his own pleasure. Jai and Maya resuscitate their love and get married. The two begin meeting in secret, as tensions between Jai and Raj grow. Raj later catches the two lovers together, and sentences Jai to death. Maya realizes that she must make difficult choices as she finds she must either accept her role as concubine to the King, or help her loved ones, who are headed down their own paths of destruction, all because of her presence in their lives. After finding Tara in the midst of a suicide attempt, Maya and Tara reconcile. Maya then teaches Tara how to seduce the King, while Tara promises to help Maya escape to visit Jai. However, when Tara goes to her husband, she tells him that she doesn't love him enough to hate him, and leaves. Maya leaves the castle and visits Jai one last time. She cuts her hair, symbolizing the end of their marriage. Maya then tries her best to make Raj free Jai by promising him everything. But knowing he can't have her heart, he rejects her plea. Just before the execution, a box arrives from the Shah, holidng the severed head of the grand vizier. Jai is killed, while Maya watches from the crowd. She leaves, just as the Shah's army arrives. Viki, riding with the army, sees Maya and calls to her, but she doesn't respond. She walks away alone, with new wisdom and strength, a heart 'as open as the sky'.poetry eroticism woman director",False,tt0116743,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4109095,0,0,0.36969833333333335,-1.2635471289974909,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16496410.333333334,34829743.666666664,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,56576255.24926193

That same year, tragedy introduced itself into her life as Plath was forced to confront the unexpected death of her father. In 1950, she began studying at Smith College on a literary scholarship, and while she was an outstanding student, she also began suffering from bouts of extreme depression. Following her junior year, she attempted suicide for the first time. Plath survived, and, in 1955, she was granted a Fulbright Scholarship to study in England at the University of Cambridge. While in Great Britain, Plath met Ted Hughes, a respected author, who would later become the British Poet Laureate. The two fell in love and married in 1956. Marriage, family and a growing reputation as an important poet nonetheless failed to bring Plath happiness.

Nineteen-year-old Nicholas, his mother, and his younger sister Kate venture to London to seek help from their wealthy, cold-hearted uncle Ralph, an investor who arranges for Nicholas to be hired as a tutor at Dotheboys Hall in Yorkshire and finds Kate work as a seamstress. Nicholas is horrified to discover his employers, the sadistic Mr and Mrs Squeers, run their boarding school like a prison and physically, verbally, and emotionally abuse their young charges on a regular basis. He eventually rebels and escapes, taking with him young crippled Smike. As they journey to London, they stumble upon a theatrical troupe owned and operated by Mr. and Mrs. Crummles. They cast them in a production of Romeo and Juliet, but despite a successful first night and the couple's invitation to stay, Nicholas is determined to continue their journey to London to learn how his mother and sister are faring. Nicholas is reunited with his family, who welcome Smike as one of their own, and finds employment with the Cheeryble brothers, and makes the acquaintance of Madeline Bray, an artist who is the sole support of herself and her tyrannical father, who gambled away his fortune and that of his late wife. Nicholas discovers his sister Kate has been subjected to humiliating sexual attention from lecherous Sir Mulberry Hawk, a client of their uncle, who has encouraged the man to seduce his niece in the hope she will succumb and thus cement Hawk's business relationship with him. Nicholas' determination to defend his sister's honor leads his uncle to vow he will destroy the young man. What ensues is a series of adventures in which the upstanding Nicholas manages to survive the schemes of his evil uncle, including an attempt to return Smike to Squeers and an effort to abort Nicholas' growing relationship with Madeline by promising her father he will excuse his debts if the girl weds Hawk. Ralph's designs on Madeline are thwarted when her father dies unexpectedly. Unfortunately, Smike falls ill and soon dies. Soon after, a sinister secret Ralph has harbored for years surfaces, and it is revealed Smike was Ralph's son, whom he had thought dead. Realizing that his son had died the best friend of his most hated enemy, Ralph hangs himself.

The Dilkes occupy one half of a double house, with Charles Brown ([[Paul Schneider   occupying the other side. Though Fanny's flirtatious personality contrasts with Keats' notably more aloof nature, she begins to pursue him after she has her siblings, Samuel and Toots, obtain his book of poetry ""Endymion"". Despite her efforts to interact with the poet it is only after witnessing her grief for the loss of his brother Tom that Keats begins to open up to Fanny's advances, when he spends Christmas with the Brawne family. After Keats begins to give poetry lessons to Fanny it becomes apparent that their attraction is mutual, however Fanny is nevertheless troubled in regards to Keats' reluctance to pursue her, for which her mother  summarizes, ""Mr Keats knows he cannot like you, he has no living and no income"". It is only after Fanny receives a valentine from Brown that Keats passionately confronts them and wonders if they are lovers. Brown, who sent the valentine in jest, warns Keats of Fanny, claiming that she is a mere flirt playing a game. On the other hand, Fanny, hurt by the accusations and Keats' lack of faith in her, ends their lessons and leaves. It is not until after the Dilkes move to Westminster that spring, leaving the Brawne family six months half rent in their home neighboring Brown, that Fanny and Keats resume their interaction and fall deeply in love. The relationship comes to an abrupt end, however, after Brown leaves for his summer rental with Keats, so that Keats may earn some money. Though Fanny is heartbroken, she is comforted by Keats' love letters. When the men return in the autumn, Fanny's mother shows concern, feeling that Fanny's attachment with the poet will hinder her from being courted. Secretly, however, Fanny and Keats are engaged. When Keats becomes ill the following winter, he spends several weeks recovering until spring, for which his friends begin a collection of funds so that he may spend the next winter in Italy where the climate is warmer. After impregnating the maid Abigail, however, Brown is unable to accompany him. Though Keats manages to find residence in London for the summer, he is taken in to live with the Brawne family following an incident in relation to his illness. It is here that, after his book sells with moderate success, Fanny's mother gives Keats her blessing to marry Fanny once he returns from Italy. The night before Keats must leave for Italy he and Fanny say their tearful goodbye in privacy, and in February—while still in Italy—Keats dies of complications from tuberculosis, just as his brother Tom did earlier in the film. In the last moments of the film Fanny cuts her hair in an act of mourning, dons black attire, and walks the snowy paths outside that Keats had walked many times in life. It is there that she recites the love sonnet he had written for her, ""Bright Star"", as she grieves the death of her lover.london, england poet independent film duringcreditsstinger woman director 19th century",False,tt0810784,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,17220091,1,0,1.025893058823529,39.7198236153607,10774480.913043479,24818030.86956522,-12327950.0,62172050.0,-220512.46153846153,13554872.153846154,19237563.0,2,74237563.0,1.0,-6795709.0,1.0,13204291.0,1.0,-15288207.0,2.0,14711793.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,27896430.0,4.0,73896430.0,2.0,93147947.0,4.0,121147947.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34823216.71428572,49108931.0,7.0,9133175.3,24859152.2,10.0,,,,,,,,,,21975011.0,121975011.0,1.0,,,,,,,27006188.0,28356188.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,59439604.8,23639604.8,1.625,1.2,151278235.71911615

A powerful pharmaceutical conglomerate boss hires Kline to find his only son Shitao who has mysteriously disappeared in the Philippines where he had been helping in an orphanage. Kline follows the trail left by the ethereal Shitao to the jungles of Mindanao, and then to the urban jungle of Hong Kong, where he enlists the help of Meng Zi, an old police officer friend. The search leads Kline to cross paths with local organized crime syndicate boss Su Dongpo, who is making trouble for the underworld, triggered by an overriding passion for his drug-addicted girlfriend Lili. Caught in the crossfire between the Hong Kong police and Su Dongpo's mafia drug ring which is also hunting for Shitao, Kline finds himself alone, in this unknown city, when Meng Zi is victim of an assassination attempt and is hospitalised. Leaving behind his 5-stars hotel for a shabby murder scene apartment in order to get inside the mind of Shitao, Kline gradually loses himself in the terrifying memories of Hasford, whose speciality was dissecting his victims' limbs while they were still alive, then reassembling them into installation sculptures. After a few weeks immersed in his haunted memories, torn between good and evil, Kline is about to leave Hong Kong when he finds Shitao, who has become a mysterious vagrant with healing powers.Synopsis, Central Films{{cite news}}",True,tt1024744,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,627422,0,0,-27.688825065107693,39.7198236153607,,,,,73111837.0,88611837.0,79541159.0,8,134041159.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11682170.0,36682170.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,134041159.0,79541159.0,1.3333333333333333,2.0,151278235.71911615

After seeing a petty thief's failed attempt to enter the cave, Jafar and his parrot, Iago, learn that only a ""Diamond in the Rough"" can enter the cave. Jasmine, the Sultan's daughter, frustrated with her life in the palace, flees to Agrabah's marketplace. There she meets street rat Aladdin and his monkey, Abu. The two discover they have a lot in common. When Aladdin is detained for thievery, Jasmine orders him released, but Jafar lies to her that Aladdin has been executed. Disguised as an elder, Jafar releases Aladdin and Abu from prison and leads them to the Cave of Wonders. The tiger-shaped head of the cave says to touch nothing but the lamp. Aladdin and Abu enter the cave, where a magic carpet guides them to the lamp. Abu's attempt to steal a ruby causes the cave to start collapsing, but the carpet flies them to the entrance. As Aladdin delivers the lamp, Jafar tries to kill him, but Abu bites Jafar in the arm and gets the lamp back as he, the carpet, and Aladdin fall back into the cave just as it closes. In the collapsed cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unexpectedly unleashing a genie, who reveals he will grant Aladdin three wishes—with the exception of murder, romance, or revival of the dead. Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing them from the cave without using a wish. While contemplating his wishes, Genie admits he would wish for freedom, since he is a prisoner to his lamp. Aladdin promises to free the Genie for his last wish. After talking about Jasmine with the Genie, Aladdin decides to use his first wish to become a prince so he can woo Jasmine. Aladdin returns to Agrabah just as Jafar tries to trick the Sultan into arranging a marriage between himself and Jasmine. When Aladdin parades into the Sultan's palace as ""Prince Ali"", Jasmine rejects Ali as a suitor. Despite the Genie's suggestion that Aladdin to tell the princess who he really is, Aladdin remains as a suave prince, and takes Jasmine around the world on the magic carpet. During the trip, Jasmine exposes Ali as a commoner, Aladdin, and demands the truth from him. Aladdin instead fabricates a story that he sometimes dresses as a commoner to escape palace life. The couple kisses as Aladdin returns her home. Afterwards, Aladdin is captured by Jafar and thrown into the ocean, but the Genie rescues Aladdin as his second wish. Aladdin returns to the palace and exposes Jafar's plot; and Jafar flees after noticing the lamp in Aladdin's possession, realizing who Aladdin is. As Aladdin gets doubtful about revealing who really is, Iago steals the Genie's lamp and brings it to Jafar, who becomes the Genie's new master. Jafar uses his first two wishes to become Sultan and the most powerful sorcerer in the world. Using his new powers, Jafar forces Jasmine and her father to bow, exposes Aladdin as a street rat, then exiles him and Abu to a frozen wasteland. Aladdin uses the magic carpet to return to Agrabah, where Jafar has imprisoned both Jasmine and the Sultan as his slaves. Jasmine distracts Jafar with a seductive act as Aladdin tries to steal back the lamp, but Jafar confronts him. He imprisons Jasmine in a large hourglass and turns himself into an enormous cobra. As Jafar traps Aladdin in his coils, he boasts to be ""the most powerful being on Earth"", which causes Aladdin to shout out that the Genie is more powerful. Faced with this realization, Jafar uses his final wish to become a genie. However, Jafar discovers that genies are not free entities as he is sucked into a black lamp, dragging Iago with him. The Genie flicks the lamp into the Cave of Wonders. After Aladdin realizes that he cannot keep pretending to be something he is not, he decides to keep his promise and wish for the Genie's freedom. Seeing Jasmine's love for Aladdin, the Sultan changes the law to allow her to marry whomever she deems worthy. The newly free Genie leaves to explore the world while Aladdin and Jasmine celebrate their engagement.",False,tt0487010,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,504050219,0,0,17.001793535714285,2.6736984935700776,,,,,,,,0,,,1176701.0,3.0,10176701.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10176701.0,1176701.0,0.375,1.0,96568078.59273516

However, he is contacted by MI7, requesting he returns to service. Johnny returns to MI7's London headquarters  and assigned by new boss ""Pegasus""  to stop a plot to assassinate the Chinese Premier during scheduled talks with the Prime Minister. Johnny also meets with fellow agent Simon Ambrose  and MI7's resident inventor, Patch Quartermain . He is also assigned a junior agent, Colin Tucker . In Hong Kong, English discovers an address that leads him to ex-CIA agent Titus Fisher . Fisher reveals that he is a member of a group of assassins called 'Vortex', who sabotaged English's mission in Mozambique. Vortex holds a secret weapon, which requires three metal keys to unlock, and Fisher reveals one. Fisher is killed by an assassin  dressed as a cleaner, and the key falls into Vortex's hands. English is humiliated in front of the Foreign Secretary and Pegasus by the loss of the key, and assaults Pegasus's mother, mistaking her for the killer cleaner. Kate Sumner , MI7's behavioural psychologist, prompts English to recall the events of his mission in Mozambique, and the identity of the second Vortex operative, Karlenko , a Russian spy. A golf match between Karlenko and English leads to multiple attempts on English's life. However, Karlenko is critically injured by the assassin, and English attempts to fly him to hospital. Before they arrive, Karlenko reveals that Vortex's last agent is a member of MI7, and dies. In a meeting at MI7, it is revealed that talks between Britain and China will continue in a heavily guarded Swiss fortress called 'Le Bastion'. Over dinner, English informs Ambrose that he knows of a mole in MI7. Ambrose prepares to kill English, until it becomes clear that the traitor's identity is unknown. Tucker confronts Ambrose in the bathroom, knowing he is the mole, but English orders him to leave. Ambrose convinces English that Quartermain is the traitor. English entrusts the key to Ambrose, who tells Pegasus that English is the traitor. English confronts Quartermain, and realises that he has been framed. He escapes in a modified wheelchair. English goes to Kate's house, and convinces her that he is not the traitor. Kate, scrutinising footage of the Mozambique mission, realises that the assassin behaved abnormally. They learn that Vortex owns a drug called timoxeline barbebutenol that allows them to control a person for a brief time before they die of heart failure. Ambrose, the only surviving member of Vortex, plans to use the drug to kill the Premier in exchange for 500 million USD. English confronts Tucker and convinces him to help break into 'Le Bastion'. English warns Pegasus of the threat, and drinks the drug instead, rendering him vulnerable to Ambrose's commands. Ambrose orders English to kill the Premier using a pistol disguised as a tube of lipstick. English tries to resist the effects of the drug , and engages in a fight with himself while Tucker attempts to interrupt communication between Ambrose and English. Tucker disrupts the frequency, replacing it with radio station, resulting in English beginning to dance. Ambrose reasserts his command, revealing himself in the process. English resists, shooting at Ambrose, who escapes. The effects of the drug wear off and English seemingly dies of heart-failure, before being revived by Kate, who kisses him on the lips, making his heart rate boost. English pursues Ambrose, parachuting from the building and hijacking a snow-mobile. English reaches Ambrose, who is in a gondola lift. The two fight, with English falling out of the car. Ambrose tries to shoot English, who shoots a rocket at the cable-car, killing Ambrose. English is knighted, but finds out that the killer cleaner was disguising herself as the Queen. He chases and attacks her with a tray, before discovering he has targeted the real Queen.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}http://www.johnny-english.com/ A post-credits scene, influenced by the barber scene in The Great Dictator, sees English making a takeaway for Kate to the tune of ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"".

It is a time of peace and the era of the samurai is waning. A sadistic young Lord Matsudaira Naritsugu rapes and kills at will. No one can touch him because he is the former shogun's son and current shogun's younger brother, and thus above the law. Sir Doi Toshitsura, a senior government official, realizes the situation will become more dangerous after Naritsugu ascends to a higher political position. After a wronged party publicly commits seppuku as a way of showing disdain for Lord Naritsugu, Sir Doi seeks out a trusted older samurai, Shinzaemon, a battle- hardened warrior who served under the former shogun, and secretly hires him to assassinate Naritsugu. However, men loyal to Naritsugu soon get wind of Sir Doi's plot, and move into action. By spying on Doi's meetings, they discover he has hired Shinazaemon. Meanwhile, Shinzaemon gathers 11 more samurai, whom Sir Doi knows can be trusted and are the strongest he knows, including his nephew Shinroukuro. The 12 plan to ambush Naritsugu on his long journey home from Edo. Before they leave, some members of the group are attacked by Hanbei's men but quickly defeat them. Shinzaemon is visited by his old sparring partner Hanbei: each tries to dissuade the other from his task in vain, with Shinzaemon saying they will meet again. In order to block Naritsugu's passage, several of the assassins are sent to buy the help of a town, and so force him to reroute to a remote village for their advantage. Shinzaemon and the others ride urgently towards the village they have chosen for the battle. On the way, they are encounter a few of Naritsugu's hired thugs, meant to slow them down while Naritsugu journeys home; they kill the thugs easily. They decide to travel stealthily through the mountains, where they meet a hunter named Kiga Koyata who leads them off the mountain and they adopt him as the thirteenth assassin. He helps them find the village they have chosen for the conflict, and they are reunited with their comrades. They take the village over and convert it into a labyrinthine mousetrap with many camouflaged fortifications. As they wait, one of the assassins out scouting the area returns with bad news; he claims that Naritsugu and his men have vanished after turning back from the blocked town. Some assassins plead with Shinzaemon to track down Naritsugu, but Shinzaemon who is always thinking ahead, tells them to wait it out; it's hard for Naritsugu and his 70 guards to hide easily. Therefore they must believe that their luck will hold out. Shinzaemon compares their attempt to catch Naritsugu to fishing; he says never reel your line in too fast, otherwise the fish will steal the bait and run away. It is better to wait till the fish swallows the bait and hook, and then reel him in at once. The next morning, their luck turns when the assassins discover that Naritsugu is heading toward the village. But when Naritsugu arrives, they discover they are outnumbered even more heavily than expected: there are over 200 guards that Hanbei has ordered from other areas, not the 70 they were expecting. Nonetheless, Shinzaemon tells the assassins that the bigger the enemy the better, and they must continue their mission. A lengthy battle follows, with Naritsugu and his guards trapped inside the village and attacked by the assassins with arrows, explosives, knives, and swords – with the exception of Koyata, who fights with rocks in slings. Naritsugu, who has led a life of luxury, is enthralled and excited by the violence, claiming it's the most fun he has had and wondering if it was like this during the sengoku period . Inevitably, the assassins fall one by one as they inflict devastating casualties on the guards until, at last, there is a one-to-one sword fight between Shinzaemon and Hanbei, each knowing the other's moves well. Naritsugu watches. As they are fighting on natural terrain and not in a dojo, Shinzaemon triumphs. He approaches Naritsugu, who is finally now unprotected. Shinzaemon tells Naritsugu that he is acting for the people, but Naritsugu tells him that both the people and Samurai have only one purpose and that is to serve their lord. Shizaemon tells Naritsugu that lords can't live without the support of the people, and that if a lord abuses his powers, the people will rise against him. Enraged, Naritsugu stabs him in the abdomen, Shinzaemon returns the thrust. Both are mortally wounded. Naritsugu crawls in the mud, experiencing fear and pain for the first time. He thanks Shinzaemon in his own way for showing him how the world can be so different from the luxuries he was bored with. Shinzaemon decapitates Naritsugu in a coup de grace. Shinzaemon collapses, telling his nephew Shinrokurô that their mission is finished and releasing him from his duty. After telling Shinrokurô that he is deemed worthy as a Samurai and that he must live his life as he sees fit, Shinzaemon dies. As Shinrokurō wanders through the carnage he discovers the hunter Koyata standing amid the chaos. Despite being impaled through the neck earlier by Naritsugu, Koyata has made what appears to be a miraculous recovery. Shinrokurō tells him that Naritusugu is dead and that now their mission is over, he planned to become the most successful bandit in Japan and travel to America to make love with the woman there, and Koyata says that he plans go back to the mountains to take his boss's woman as his own. Shinrokurō says tell her he said hi; Koyata promises that he will before happily hopping over the corpses as he leaves. Alone, Shinrokurō drags his sword behind him as he leaves the village. An epilogue states that the Shogun and the government covered up what really occurred, announcing that Naritsugu died of illness. 23 years later, the Shogunate falls and opens way for the Meiji Era.japan suicide assassin samurai immortality mission swordsman massacre battle violence samurai sword seppuku code of honor ronin kimono warrior 19th century harakiri",False,tt1436045,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,17555141,1,0,1.9258568333333328,-2.2977368060284267,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-30141861.0,4858139.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,102557850.13709407

The attack is interrupted when a meteorite falls from the sky into a nearby car, giving Sam the chance to escape. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables his face is scratched by a pale, hairless, blind and eye-less dog-sized creature; the object which fell from the sky was its cocoon. Together, the gang chase and kill the creature. Hoping to gain fame and profit they take it to their acquanitance the cannabis dealer Ron  to gain advice, who lives at the top of their tower block, Wyndham Tower. Moses asks Ron and his boss, local gangster Hi-Hatz , to keep the creature in their fortified ""weed room"" while he decides how to proceed. More objects begin to fall from the sky. Eager to fight more of the creatures, the gang arm themselves and go to the nearest crash site. They find new, gorilla-sized blind aliens, these ones with spiky fur which is so black it doesn't reflect light, huge claws and multiple rows of glowing fangs. Fleeing the aliens, the gang are intercepted by the police and Moses is arrested, identified as a mugger by Sam. The aliens, following Moses, maul the police to death and attack their van, leaving Sam and Moses trapped inside. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives the van away, only to crash the van into Hi-Hatz's car. Sam runs away while the rest of Moses' gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz. Enraged about his car, Hi-Hatz threatens them with a gun, refusing to believe their story of aliens - until his henchman is attacked by one, allowing the gang to escape. The gang attempts to flee to Wyndham Tower but are again followed and attacked en route by the aliens, where Biggz is forced to hide in a rubbish container, and Pest gets severely bitten in the leg. They discover Sam lives in their building, force their way into her flat, and persuade her to treat Pest's leg. An infant of the furry aliens bursts in and Moses kills it with a samurai sword through the head. Sam reasons it is safer to stay with the gang than on her own and joins them. The gang moves upstairs to the flat of some neighbourhood girls believing their security gate will keep them safe. The adult furry aliens instead attack from outside, climbing up the side of the tower block, smashing through the window and they bite through Dennis' motorcycle helmet, killing him. As one alien is about to kill Moses, Sam stabs it through the head, saving him. The girls note that the aliens went straight for Moses and kick the gang out of the flat, believing them to be the focus of the creatures. In the hall, the gang is attacked by Hi-Hatz and more henchmen. The gang escapes while an alien pursues Hi-Hatz and his henchmen into a lift. Hi-Hatz kills the alien, though his henchmen perish, and continues his search for Moses. Making their way upstairs to Ron's weed room, the gang runs into more aliens, but using fireworks as distractions, they get by. Jerome, however, becomes disoriented in the smoke and is killed by an alien. Entering Ron's flat they find that Hi-Hatz is already there. Hi-Hatz prepares to shoot Moses but hordes of aliens smash through the window and tear off his face. Moses, Pest and Sam, joined by Ron's weed customer Brewis , retreat into the weed room while Ron hides in the flat. Biggz, still trapped in the bin by an awaiting adult alien, is saved by Probs and Mayhem, two unruly children, using a water-gun filled with petrol and a flame to torch the creature, since their only apparant weakness is fire. In the weed room, Brewis notices a luminescent liquid on Moses' jacket under the ultraviolet light. Brewis theorises that the aliens are like spores, drifting through space on solar winds until they chance on a suitable planet. After landing in an area with enough food, the female then lets off a strong pheromone which will attract the male creatures to it so that they can mate and propogate their species in their new world. Brewis suggests that the smaller, hairless alien which Moses killed in the beginning was such a female, and it had left a mating scent on Moses that the larger male aliens have been tracking throughout the evening. The gang form a plan for Sam, who has not been stained with the pheromone, to go to Moses' flat and turn on the gas oven. Before she leaves, Moses forces Pest to return the ring they stole from her, feeling guilty for having mugged her. Sam successfully avoids the aliens, turns on the gas and leaves the Block. Moses, with the dead female alien strapped to his back, rushes out of the weed room and into his flat, while the males converge on the scent and chase Moses through the block. Inside his flat he throws the female into the kitchen and the males follow. Using fireworks, Moses ignites the gas-filled room and leaps out the window.

Owen has subjected Cameron to intense psychological testing from a young age in an effort to unbury the hidden powers of the human mind. During a series of mysterious and bizarre circumstances in their rural house one night, Owen is decapitated by a machete, yet the authorities can find no evidence of foul play and rule it out as an accidental death believing he simply fell on it. Cameron goes to live with his mother Dory Lansing  and her obnoxious actor boyfriend Bob Froelich  in Los Angeles. Both Dory and Bob are unaware of Cameron's paranormal abilities. Sergeant Sam Taliaferro  of the Homicide Division of the LAPD has sleeping trouble and a recurring nightmare which is affecting his work. Taliaferro's partner, Detective Pete Groom  complains about Taliaferro's frequent bouts of absent-mindedness in the line of duty caused his lack of sleep, and so Taliaferro is ordered to go see a psychiatrist who works with the department, Dr. Nora Haley . When Bob Froelich is horrifically murdered in Cameron's room, having been thrown out of the second-floor window with his eyes burnt out of the sockets, Sam Taliaferro, Pete Groom and Nora Haley are put on the case. As they investigate the perplexing case, Taliaferro befriends Cameron and realizes that deaths are occurring always around the boy, and that his nightmares seem to be linked to the boy. Under her counselling sessions Nora Haley also realizes that the boy has paranormal abilities, even being able to foresee future events. It also becomes apparent to Taliaferro that whatever Cameron concentrates on hard enough or focuses on is manifesting itself into reality. Cameron plays an imaginative game with a figurine his father gave to him he calls the ""Deceptor"", actually an ancient figure of a Mayan demonic entity said to be terrible beyond description in Owen Lansing's texts. Cameron's imagination makes the creature real and it takes up residence in Cameron's bedroom closet. Soon, numerous inexplicable and gruesome deaths are occurring around the closet in Cameron's room, and people who have already died seem to be mysteriously reappearing in an undead state. Bob Froelich is horrifyingly resurrected in Cameron's closet and murders Detective Pete Groom when he looks inside the closet. Taliaferro and Haley seek out Owen Lansing's assistant, Professor Ben Majors  at his home in the woods, where they learn the truth about Cameron. Taliaferro is stalked through the woods by Pete Groom's ghost, who warns him that the evil is ""out of the closet now."" The demons soon wish to destroy Cameron, thus severing their link to limbo and sealing them within reality and in our world. Majors kidnaps Cameron and takes him back to Cameron's house where Majors is then murdered by the demon, his blood boiling in his veins. Only Sam Taliaferro and Nora Haley are able to protect Cameron. Cameron goes back to his room to face the demon in the closet once and for all and attempt to send it back to the lowest regions of Hell before Cameron loses his powers to it.telekinesis maya civilization psychokinesis psychic demon",False,tt0097008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,136203,0,0,-50.393875318458484,1.4934829882721732,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,47137400.206980206

Ben Jonson, who has the manuscripts, hides them in the Rose theatre, but it is burned down while being searched. Successive flashbacks cast us back five and then forty years, as the film evokes the reputed life of Edward de Vere from childhood through to his entanglement in an insurrection, and later on to his death. The main action takes place towards the end of the Elizabethan era as political intrigue flourishes between the Tudors and the Cecils , over the succession to Queen Elizabeth I. In flashbacks, de Vere is portrayed as a prodigious genius, writing at eight or nine years of age  A Midsummer Night's Dream, de Vere acting the role of Puck before the young queen Elizabeth. He is then forced to live in the repressive, puritanical house of William Cecil where, years later, he kills a spying servant lurking behind an arras, much like the death of Polonius in Hamlet. William Cecil uses this murder to blackmail de Vere into a loveless marriage with his daughter, Anne Cecil, compelling him also to renounce literature. De Vere later becomes the Queen's lover, and sires – unknown to him – an illegitimate son; the son is adopted, becoming Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, but his true parentage is hidden from all but the Cecils. De Vere must struggle against a taboo that would forbid him to write; against his wife's impatience with his literary work as a dishonour to her family;{{harvnb}}:'his literary efforts were considered an improper use of a nobleman’s time – “you’re writing again,” his wife hisses, as if she’d caught him fondling the scullery maid. “Why must you continue to humiliate my family?” Thus he scribbles in secret.' and against the Queen's counsellors. Foremost among these is his father-in-law William Cecil, who is convinced that theatres are sinful. Cecil's plan to have James, the son of Mary, Queen of Scots crowned king is also threatened by the presence of de Vere's and the Queen's child, who would be an alternative contender for the throne, and also of pure Tudor lineage. Almost four decades after his private première, de Vere visits a public theatre and is deeply impressed by the way spectators can be swayed. The play, written by Ben Jonson, is halted mid-perfomance by the royal militia because of its allegedly seditious content. Jonson is arrested and imprisoned. Much taken by the propagandistic power of art, considering that ""all art is political ... otherwise it is just decoration,"" de Vere decides to employ his secretly written plays for the promotion of the Earl of Essex's cause  over the candidate preferred by the Cecils, writing Henry V and, later, Richard III as propaganda designed to foment revolution. He contacts Jonson, who is confined in the Tower of London until de Vere uses his influence to free him, in order to have his play Henry V staged under Jonson's name. Jonson is unhappy about the plan, assuming that the play will be an amateurish effort that will tarnish his name. Jonson does not claim authorship, allowing an unscrupulous young actor, William Shakespeare, to step up on stage as author. It is this ""drunken oaf"" who takes on the role as de Vere's front man, while Jonson becomes de Vere's only confidant in the truth. Shakespeare however, having discovered the real author's identity, extorts money from de Vere to build the Globe theatre, and wangles £400 per year for posturing as a front. After Christopher Marlowe stumbles on the truth that Shakespeare's inexplicable talents hide the genius of another hand, he is found with his throat slit. Jonson later confronts Shakespeare and accuses him of the murder. At the climax, de Vere uses the play Richard III as a thinly veiled attack on the hunchbacked Robert Cecil. The plan is to incite a mob to march against Cecil, and thus weaken his position at court. At the same time, Essex is to march with the Earl of Southampton to the Palace, to promote his own claim to the succession. Meanwhile, de Vere writes Venus and Adonis to remind the Queen of their old love. He hopes to see her again in an atmosphere of renewed intimacy, and to persuade her to dismiss Cecil. However the plan fails, as a jealous Jonson betrays the plot to Cecil, who guns down the mob, stopping it from joining Essex. The Queen, swayed by Cecil, thinks that Essex is trying to depose her violently. Cecil easily captures Essex and Southampton, who are condemned for treason. Robert Cecil then tells a broken de Vere that Elizabeth had other bastard sons – one of which was de Vere himself. If true, it would mean that de Vere committed incest with his mother. He has a private audience with Elizabeth, at which the Queen agrees to save Southampton, but insists that de Vere remain anonymous as the true author of 'Shakespeare's' works. After the Queen's death, James succeeds, though Cecil's hopes of a more puritanical regime are shattered when James expresses his wish to see more of Shakespeare's work. Shakespeare retires on his ill-gotten gains to Stratford to become a businessman, and de Vere dies in 1604, having commended his manuscripts to the care of a repentant Ben Jonson. Cecil however still wants the manuscripts destroyed. With the destruction of the Rose, he believes them burnt, but Jonson later discovers they have survived. Nevertheless, the 'truth' that Edward de Vere, not the nearly illiterate Shakespeare, is their real author remains concealed.william shakespeare anonymity poet politics play duringcreditsstinger false history 16th century secrecy",False,tt1521197,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,15395087,1,0,-0.9486736255533992,1.026708649479613,,,61288429.10714286,100863429.10714285,53569290.72727273,92569290.72727273,102000000.0,4,152000000.0,1.0,68502691.33333333,12.0,111002691.33333333,6.0,153998675.75,7.0,213373675.75,4.0,77001798.0,27.0,117501798.0,3.0,26506485.75,19.0,41506485.75,4.0,,0.0,,,37378069.0,5.0,46709402.333333336,3.0,,0.0,,,,,,101183863.0,171183863.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,47442408.4,70342408.4,5.0,,,,134231686.5,212231686.5,2.0,,,,4570463.0,26570463.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,113682342.19444445,77564619.97222222,9.25,3.5,83145037.44008958

Suddenly they look up and see something . Then the three girls get up and walk in a trance-like state to the window where they jump out to their death. In London Arthur Kipps , a penniless lawyer and the widowed father of four-year-old Joseph, is charged by his office to obtain the paperwork with which to sell a large manor – the bleak, isolated and desolate Eel Marsh House. Though he is hesitant to leave his son alone with a nanny, Arthur's boss warns him that if he fails to complete his duty he will lose his job. Arthur is treated coldly upon his arrival and is barely able to get a room for the night, but he meets a kind local man named Samuel Daily  and his wife Elisabeth  who allow him to stay at their home. Arthur visits his legal contact, Mr. Jerome, who hurries him off with a stack of papers, telling him to return to London. Instead, Arthur pays the coachman to take him to Eel Marsh House, where he feels he will be able to more thoroughly complete his work. While there he is distracted by odd noises, footsteps and finally a brief appearance by a woman dressed in black. Arthur then hears a commotion in Eel Marsh, and runs out only to find his coachman waiting for him. As Arthur reports the incident to the police, three children come into the station; two boys carrying their very pale little sister who had just drank lye. She subsequently collapses in Arthur's arms and dies. That night, Sam reveals that he and his wife lost their son in a drowning accident, and Elisabeth – who has lost her mind with grief – carves a figure into the table of someone being hanged before she is sedated by Sam and their butler. The next day Arthur decides to stay the night at Eel Marsh House to finish his work, and discovers letters from Alice Drablow, the home's recently deceased owner, and her mentally disturbed sister Jennet Humfrye ([[Liz White . Jennet claims Alice stole her son Nathaniel away from her and demands to let her see him. In subsequent letters it is revealed the boy drowned in the marsh and that Jennet blamed Alice before killing herself. Toys begin making noise upstairs in Nathaniel's room, where Arthur witnesses the spirits of the Woman in Black and a mud-covered Nathaniel. The next day, Arthur learns that the deaths are the work of Jennet Humfrye, the Woman in Black, who cursed the town after her child was taken from her. Elisabeth then indicates that Joseph, who is being brought to the town by his nanny the next day, is a target for the Woman in Black. In an attempt to lift the curse, Arthur decides to reunite Nathaniel and Jennet by finding Nathaniel's body in the marsh with Sam's help. They place his body in the Eel Marsh House, where Jennet finds him lying in his planned nursery bed and it appears to Arthur that she is satisfied. However, she is unable to hold him, presumably because he doesn't feel the same connection. Arthur and Sam then place Jennet's son in the grave with her before covering it back up. The next night, Joseph and Arthur are reunited and intend on immediately returning to London, but Joseph slips away while Arthur and Sam are busy talking. Arthur soon notices the Woman in Black on the other side of the station, and Joseph walking along the train tracks under her command, and it becomes apparent that the curse will never be lifted. Arthur leaps onto the tracks in an attempt to save Joseph from an oncoming train as Sam looks on. Once it passes, Arthur calls out to Sam, but he and the nanny are gone and everything around them is dark. Joseph asks ""Who's that lady?"" Arthur looks and sees a glowing blonde woman in a white dress standing on the tracks, and smiles before responding ""That's your Mummy."" Stella Kipps takes the hand of her husband and the family disappears into the fog and darkness as Jennet, silently sobbing, looks at them with envy. Just as the film ends, her face slowly pivots towards the audience as the screen turns to black.london, england secret remake revenge dead child lawyer photograph gothic horror period drama super power hammer horror estate ghost",True,tt1596365,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,127730736,1,0,6.5135727058823525,-10.812845724436539,,,2115085.5,12255275.0,22872217.227272727,35178150.45454545,713658346.4444444,11,856325013.1111112,9.0,23883777.0,15.0,51183777.0,5.0,-8059872.5,14.0,2440127.5,2.0,,0.0,,,62386573.0,6.0,73136573.0,2.0,3842000.0,19.0,25842000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,38625594.333333336,78292261.0,3.0,170990672.0,269240672.0,4.0,,,,-17982197.0,32017803.0,1.0,49238440.0,64238440.0,1.0,2294373.0,4294373.0,1.0,2294373.0,4294373.0,1.0,2294373.0,4294373.0,1.0,113421694.71428572,145335980.42857143,7.0,-7552701.0,23113965.666666668,3.0,,,,,,,32891081.0,54191081.0,5.0,-1445419.0,5554581.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6957013.666666667,12890347.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,50282030.0,55957030.0,2.0,,,,2294373.0,4294373.0,1.0,,,201785498.12222224,159142164.78888887,8.125,3.8,123186632.01668148

He writes to her son, Ryan, who is in fact his own son, telling him he intends to return. After years of raising horses and living a solitary life, Blackthorn sets off for Potosí to sell his horses. He tells his lover, Yana , that he will see her again before leaving Bolivia. At Potosí, Blackthorn withdraws his savings from the bank, sells his horses, and then heads back to his village. Along the way, he is ambushed and nearly killed. He shoots his attacker, but not before Blackthorn's horse, Cinco, bolts off with his money. The shooter is Eduardo Apodaca , a Spaniard mining engineer who claims he was shooting at pursuers. He begs Blackthorn to save him, and offers to share part of the 50,000 he stole from Simón Patiño, a powerful Bolivian industrialist and mine owner. The money is hidden in an abandoned mine, and he will compensate Blackthorn for his help. Blackthorn and the Spaniard set out across the desert plateau with Patiño's posse within a day's pursuit. They reach the abandoned mine and find the money, but the posse catches up with them. Following a shootout, Blackthorn and the Spaniard escape with the money. They make their way to Blackthorn's cabin, where the famous outlaw remembers his old friendships with the Sundance Kid and Etta Place, and how they escaped from Pinkerton Detective Mackinley . Yana joins the men at the cabin, and Blackthorn gives her a pocket watch he won in a card game. At first she rejects it as a ""gringo machine"", but then accepts the gift as something to remember him by. Later, Yana returns to the cabin to stay with Blackthorn on his last night before leaving. The next morning, two female members of the posse come to the cabin looking for the Spaniard, and in the ensuing gunfight, Blackthorn is wounded, and Yana is killed. A heartbroken Blackthorn and the Spaniard leave with the rest of the posse not far behind. They set out across the Uyuni salt flats, hoping to reach the coast where Blackthorn can find a boat to take him home. Halfway across, the posse catches up to them, but Blackthorn and the Spaniard split up and are able to kill their pursuers and escape. When he reaches Tupiza, Blackthorn is treated by a doctor, who notifies former Pinkerton Detective Mackinley—now living a quiet life in Bolivia—of his famous patient. Mackinley confirms the man's identity. For years Mackinley claimed that the two bandits killed at San Vincente were not Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and now he will finally be proven correct. But after initially notifying the Bolivian army of the discovered outlaw, Mackinley changes his mind, returns Blackthorn's pistol, and helps him escape. When Mackinley later discovers that Blackthorn was involved with the Spaniard, he reveals the truth to him about the Spaniard and his pursuers. Apparently, the 50,000 the Spaniard stole was not from the powerful mine owner, Patiño, but from the mining families who recently took control of the mines. The Spaniard stole the money from ""the people""—something Butch Cassidy would never have done. Although disgusted with Blackthorn's involvement, he does not betray him. Blackthorn tracks the Spaniard into the Andes, with the Bolivian army not far behind. When Blackthorn catches up with him and confronts him with the truth, the Spaniard does not deny it, saying the money he stole was indeed from the mine owners—just ""different owners"".

After defeating the Ottoman defenders, Solomon and his men enter the fortress, only to enter a room of enchanted mirrors. Demons trapped within the mirrors attack and kill most of the crew, but Solomon fights his way into the throne room of the fortress. Inside, as he helps himself to the fortress's treasure, a demon dressed in hooded black robes and armed with a flaming sword appears. The demon announces itself as ""the Devil's Reaper"" and tells Solomon his evil deeds have irrevocably damned his soul, and he is now destined for Hell. After a brief duel, Solomon cries ""I am not yet ready for Hell!"" and leaps from the throne room window into the sea. As he falls to safety, the Reaper snarls that Solomon's soul will be the Devil's. Following his encounter with the Devil's Reaper, Solomon returns home to England and finds sanctuary in a monastery in the countryside. Due to the Abbot's dreams, Solomon is soon expelled and sent to his ancestral estates in Devon, where Solomon has not been since his father disowned him. Along the way, he is ambushed by robbers and, as he has fully embraced a life of peace and will not fight back, he is knocked unconscious. He is found and treated by the Crowthorns, a family of Puritans traveling west to the New World. He travels with them but the family is itself ambushed by corrupted followers of the sorcerer Malachi and his brutal lieutenant, the Masked Rider. Most of the family is killed, except Meredith, who is kidnapped with her mother Katherine. When Samuel, Meredith's younger brother, is mercilessly slain right before his shocked eyes, an enraged Solomon charges into battle and kills several of Malachi's followers. William Crowthorn, Meredith's father, declares as he dies that Solomon's soul will be redeemed if he rescues Meredith. Solomon, having now re-embraced a life of violence to fight off the attackers, takes a horse, arms himself and sets out in pursuit. Solomon battles Malachi's followers across the countryside, rescuing many captives but not finding Meredith. On his journey, he meets a deranged priest who informs him Malachi's followers are taking the weaker survivors of their raids as slaves, while corrupting the strong into soldiers. The priest tries to feed Solomon to his parishioners, who have become undead ghouls. Solomon escapes, only to be set upon by the robbers who attacked him earlier, who have been turned by the Rider into soldiers of Malachi. Killing all but one of the robbers for interrogation, Solomon is told that Meredith is dead. Solomon refuses to believe this and angrily leaves the robber for the undead to feed on. Moving on, Solomon comes to a village, where he heads to an Inn and drinks to excess, his soul now definitely damned for not saving the girl. Former shipmates recognise him and try to recruit him as a leader of a resistance against Malachi. Kane refuses. However, Malachi's followers hear of this and attack the Inn at dawn, crucifying any members of the attempted resistance movement including Kane. As they move away, a cart containing Meredith passes behind them. She recognises Kane and calls out. He realises that he still has a chance to save her and pulls himself off the cross. Before Malachi's remaining men can kill him, they are killed by survivors of the resistance, who take Solomon to safety. Kane is treated with magic by an old pagan witch and is soon ready to return to the pursuit. The resistance explain some of Malachi's background  and reveal that he now lives in Kane's ancestral home. Kane leads them into the castle via an underground passage. As the resistance fights Malachi's soldiers, Kane heads for the dungeons and frees many of the captives. He does not find Meredith, but he does find his father, emaciated and locked in magic chains. His father explains that the Masked Rider is really Kane's older brother Marcus Kane, whom Kane thought he had killed in an accident shortly after he was banished as a teenager. Marcus was, however, only severely injured and left in a coma: after the priests and healers failed to awake him, Solomon's father turned to Malachi, who brought Marcus back to life: however, Marcus was horribly disfigured and left subservient to Malachi, who turned Marcus into his enforcer: the Masked Rider. At his father's request, Solomon reluctantly shoots him dead and heads to the throne room to confront Malachi. In the throne room, Kane confronts Malachi, who remarks everything that has happened to Solomon was meant to lead him to this place before disappearing. Solomon also finds Meredith caged in the throne room: before she can warn him it is a trap, Marcus stabs Solomon in the back with his sword. Despite his injury, Solomon pleads with his brother, but his cries fall on deaf ears so he grudgingly draws his sword and the two brothers fight to the death: after a lengthy battle, Solomon sets fire to Marcus and decapitates him. At the same time, Malachi uses Meredith's ""innocent blood"" to open a portal, thus releasing a demon sent to claim Solomon's soul, which attacks Kane. After a desperate fight, Kane shoots Malachi in the head, and all three souls  are apparently pulled into Hell. It transpires that Kane, in saving Meredith from Malachi, redeemed his soul and so escapes Hell. Meredith travels to America with her mother, while Solomon, after burying his father and brother, declares that evil exists elsewhere in the world and that he will put an end to it.mercenary murder puritan sorcerer trap bag over head violence gothic horror covered wagon monastery mercy killing healing hanged body pile of gold 16th century sword and sorcery",True,tt0970452,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,7810000,1,0,-4.7618437900128034,39.7198236153607,48780476.333333336,91447143.0,,,,,-6876149.0,5,16123851.0,1.0,54616974.75,17.0,78366974.75,4.0,53472904.0,28.0,58972904.0,1.0,17316267.0,4.0,105316267.0,1.0,59000000.0,32.0,80500000.0,2.0,47397288.8,14.0,89867288.8,5.0,21975011.0,6.0,121975011.0,1.0,,0.0,,,68573774.0,80573774.0,1.0,,,,,,,702862795.0,842862795.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,7890433.375,55390433.375,8.0,,,,,,,,,,-11527072.666666666,55139594.0,3.0,-12189018.8,10810981.2,5.0,3434529.3333333335,63101196.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-7997208.0,12402792.0,2.0,,,,-16062130.0,23937870.0,1.0,,,,47775102.0,89775102.0,2.0,,,,101265204.0,179265204.0,1.0,,,78731756.65,35271756.65,13.25,2.142857142857143,151278235.71911615

However, Greg worries about how his ""uncool and embarrassing"" best friend, Rowley Jefferson , will fit in. While Rowley is a good friend who helps Greg escape his terrorizing older brother, Rodrick , Greg worries that Rowley's ""dorky"" clothes and personality will embarrass both of them. On their first day, Greg and Rowley meet Angie Steadman , a seventh grader who works for the school's paper. Throughout the school year, Angie gives Greg and Rowley information about the workings of middle school, which she believes was created to store kids while they make the awkward transition between children to teenagers. Classmate Chirag Gupta  tells Greg and Rowley the story behind the moldy slice of Swiss cheese laying on the school's basketball court; upon touching the cheese, a student named Darren Walsh  contracted the Cheese Touch and caused the 1st Cheese Touch Apocalypse; anyone who touches the cheese will create chaos and they pass on the Cheese Touch by touching someone else. The Cheese Touch eventually got taken away by a German exchange student named Dieter Müller, who moved back to Düsseldorf over the Summer and took the Cheese Touch with him. Greg is determined to be voted a ""class favorite"" and listed in the yearbook, but each of his attempts to do so backfires. His popularity quickly drops as he loses to Patty Farrell , Greg's archenemy, and Fregley , the weirdest and 201st most popular  kid in school, in scholastic wrestling ; making Greg the 72nd most popular kid in school. Greg angers teenagers on Halloween night by threatening to call the police on them after they spray him and Rowley with a fire extinguisher, and then damages their eight-generation Ford F150 pickup truck with a weed whacker; Greg joins the geeky Safety Patrol with Rowley; and breaks Rowley's left hand during winter vacation during a game Greg invented with his Big Wheel. At school, everyone notices Rowley's broken hand and Rowley becomes very popular, much to Greg's dismay. Rowley's popularity increases when he beats Greg to become the school paper's cartoonist, despite Greg's dismissal of his ideas. Greg and Rowley's friendship falls apart after Greg allows Rowley to take the blame for a mistake Greg made during Safety Patrol. Since Rowley couldn't get his cast wet in the rain, Greg had to walk the kids home, but panicked and began to push the kids into a hole upon seeing a truck similar to the one the teenagers he and Rowley had angered on Halloween. It turned out that it was just a middle-aged man, and Mrs. Irvine mistakes Greg for Rowley, as Greg had borrowed Rowley's coat. Greg ditches the kindergarteners and Mrs. Irvine calls Mr. Winsky. Mr. Winsky suspends Rowley from Safety Patrol, and forces him to apologize to the kindergarteners, even though he has no idea of what happened. A few days later, Greg tells Rowley the truth and tries to tell it as a joke, but Rowley berates him for being a bad friend who cares about nothing but himself. When Mr. Winsky, the Safety Patrol teacher, hears what had actually happened from the kindergarteners, he decides to relieve Greg of his duties and promotes Rowley as the captain. Rowley then leaves and breaks up with Greg and befriends a kid named Collin Lee . Greg tries to move on by having a sleep over with Fregley, but Fregley's sugar-induced hyperactivity is too much for him to take so he hides in the bathroom. Later that night, Fregley slips a piece of paper under the bathroom door and after reading the note Greg passes out and is later taken home by his father. He then tries to pursue popularity without Rowley by auditioning for the school play of The Wizard of Oz, but the performance is ruined by Patty Farrel when she throws a huge temper tantrum at Greg when he does not sing and blames him for the play being ruined. As a result of this, Greg throws an apple at her resulting an apple-throwing fight in the middle of the performance, making Greg the 202nd most popular kid. At the school mother-son dance, Greg's mother  suggests Greg ask Rowley to go out for ice cream with them. However, after Rowley and his Mom danced, Collin tells Greg that he and Rowley already have plans. Later, Greg is excited when Rowley comes up to him in school, but is disappointed when he learns Rowley only wants a video game back. Greg refuses to return the game, causing them to get into an argument and the kids gather around them, wanting them to fight, but are quickly dispelled when the teenagers that Greg and Rowley had angered on Halloween drive up, looking for revenge. The teenagers find the Cheese and make Rowley eat it. They are about to force Greg to eat the cheese when Coach Malone arrives, leading the teenagers to run away. The children return and find the partially eaten cheese. Patty begins to accuse Rowley for causing the 2nd Cheese Touch Apocalypse, but Greg steps in and takes the blame. He picks up the cheese and makes a profound speech about the ridiculousness of the cheese and other middle school institutions, but it is ruined when Patty realizes that Greg has the Cheese Touch, causing everyone to run away from Greg. Greg and Rowley reconcile, and Angie approaches them to compliment Greg for his bravery. The film ends with Greg, Rowley, and Angie laughing after Patty hugged Rowley and contracted the Cheese Touch, and Greg narrating that he still has the summer and next year ahead of him. Greg finally achieves his dream of being made a class favorite along with Rowley as both being made the cutest friends.based on novel or book coming of age young boy breaking the fourth wall middle school popularity duringcreditsstinger live action and animation friendship drama line drawing",False,tt1196141,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,76954311,1,0,4.130287399999999,-2.2977368060284267,,,,,577315706.3333334,718482373.0,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-10730514.0,5.0,119269486.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32378456.0,142045122.66666666,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,34352607.0,64352607.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,119269486.0,-10730514.0,0.625,1.0,102557850.13709407

The four Furlings central to the story are Abigail , a woodmouse; Russell , a hedgehog; Edgar , a mole; and a badger named Michelle , who is Cornelius' niece. One day, the Furlings go on a trip through the forest with Cornelius, where they see a road for the first time. Russell is almost run over by a careless driver, who throws away a glass bottle, which shatters in the middle of the road. Cornelius orders the Furlings to forget the road altogether. The ramble ends in a boat ride. Afterward, they go back to the forest to find out that it has been destroyed with poison gas from an overturned tanker truck that blew a tire from the broken glass bottle while transporting chlorine gas. Michelle runs to her home worried about her parents, breathing some of the gas and become severely ill. The gas inside the house has already killed both of her parents. Abigail manages to save Michelle, and the Furlings go to Cornelius' house nearby for shelter after they found their homes deserted. There, Cornelius tells the Furlings that they need to fetch two herbs that can save Michelle's life: lungwort and eyebright. With limited time, they head off for their journey the next day. After encountering numerous dangers including a hungry barn owl, a flock of religious wrens including their reverend Phineas , and intimidating construction equipment, which the wrens call ""yellow dragons"", the Furlings make it to the meadow with the herbs they need. There, they meet the bully squirrel Waggs , and Willy, a tough but sensible mouse. After getting the eyebright, they discover that the lungwort is on a giant cliff making it inaccessible by foot. Russell suggests they use Cornelius' airship, the Flapper-Wing-a-Ma-Thing, to get to the lungwort. The Furlings manage to get the lungwort after dangerous flight up the cliff, then steer their airship back for Dapplewood. They crash-land back in the forest after a storm, and bring the herbs to Michelle and Cornelius. A group of humans who come to clean up the gas' mess appear, the animals escape through the backdoor of Cornelius's house. Unfortunately, Edgar gets separated from the group, and , gets caught in an old trap. When one of the workers finds him, the animals are at first worried about their friend, but are surprised when he frees Edgar and smashes the trap before stuffing it in his trash bag, an act Cornelius never expected a human to do, making him realise that there are good humans in the world. After taking Cornelius to the site where they crashed, the Furlings give him the herbs to cure Michelle. The next day, she wakes up from her coma after a teardrop from her uncle fearing her to be dead. The Furlings' families and many of the other inhabitants arrive as well, except for Michelle's mother and father, who were killed in the gas accident but Corneilus promised to look after her. The Furlings happily reunite with their families, who are relieved to see that their children are alright. Michelle asks Cornelius if anything will ever be the same again. Cornelius looks at the dead trees in the forest and says to her that if everyone works as hard to save Dapplewood as the Furlings did to save Michelle, it will be. The film ends with an overhead shot of Dapplewood to show that much of the forest is still alive and that there is still hope to rebuild and make a home.friendship animal",False,tt0107745,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,6582052,0,0,-0.9750679575305696,-19.533412250327295,,,74965754.875,91117629.875,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,41299258.6989175

At the last minute, a school bus overtakes the army vehicles and detonates the bomb as it passes, killing the children. After most of the team escape the scene pursued by the soldiers, Fallon travels to London in a bid to escape the past. In London, he is approached by a contact who asks him to take on one last job on behalf of local gangster Jack Meehan  and his brother Billy Meehan . They offer Fallon money, a passport and passage to the US if he kills a rival gangster. Initially reluctant, he nonetheless takes on the job. However, as he is carrying out the hit in a graveyard, he is seen and confronted by the local Catholic priest, Father Michael Da Costa . The confrontation is watched from a distance by Billy Meehan, who tells his brother there is a witness to the killing. Fallon visits the church and confesses to the priest in a bid to ensure his silence; he also meets and finds himself becoming attracted to the priest's blind niece Anna , who lives at the church along with her uncle. Meehan, however, insists that Fallon must kill the priest too and tells Fallon he will not be paid until the loose end is tied up. Fallon now finds himself targeted by both the Meehans and the IRA, who see him as a security risk following his disappearance, and send Docherty and another member, Siobhan Donovan , to London to persuade him to return to Ireland. Billy Meehan eventually decides to take matters in his own hands and goes to the church looking for Fallon, but Anna kills him in a struggle when he attacks her after finding her alone in the church house. Fallon meanwhile manages to outwit a group of Meehan's men who had been assigned to kill him after tricking him aboard a boat he was assured would be taking him to the US. Returning to the church, Fallon finds Jack Meehan with a bomb he intends to use to kill the priest and his niece but which will be blamed on Fallon and his IRA connections.

At first he is confused, but he slowly opens up to Dr. Park, recalling an incident in which he assaulted Mr. Debrofkowitz, the owner of a dry-cleaning service. He starts his story one night where he not is investigating shipment docks, and assaults a police officer who claims to be working undercover. Dooney  is a corrupt detective whose crack smoking, and having a prostitute in his company, leads Defendor to believe that he is under the employ of his arch nemesis, named Captain Industry. After leaving Dooney, he goes to a coffee shop while his description goes out on an APB. A nearby policeman hears it on his radio, and Poppington is arrested. The captain in charge, Fairbanks , sparks a kinship with Poppington because both of their grandfathers had served in the war, a subject which came up upon Fairbanks recognizing the trench club that Poppington uses as a primary weapon. After releasing him, Arthur takes his weapon back and disappears. It becomes apparent that Arthur lives alone in the government construction department that he works at during the day. His life is very solitary, but after another confrontation with Dooney, he meets Angel , the prostitute who was smoking crack with Dooney. He is brutally beaten by Dooney's friends and she helps him recover. He learns that she is aware of Captain Industry's whereabouts and he allows her to live with him because with Dooney mad at her, she has no place else to go. For 40 a day, he enlists her help in apprehending Industry. It is also revealed that Poppington's mother Fay had left him as a child, and drug abuse and possibly prostitution killed her some years later. His grandfather said that the ""captains of industry"" killed her. As a child he misinterpreted and got the impression that one man was responsible. Angel later reveals that she had been lying about her name. Her real name is Katerina Debrofkowitz. Arthur's boss and close friend Paul ([[Michael Kelly , becomes concerned that Arthur is living at the construction depot with a prostitute. Paul tries to help Arthur, and offers him the opportunity to come and live with him and his family. Arthur rejects the offer. Paul gives Arthur a cell phone in case he is ever needed. That night, Arthur ventures out to spy on ""Captain Industry"" and Dooney in a meeting, but accidentally makes himself known. After a short chase Arthur calls Paul's line before he is shot by one of the henchman's machine guns, Paul forces Angel to take him to where Arthur was supposed to be that night, and they call the paramedics. While undergoing surgery, Paul orders Angel to leave Arthur alone. They are relieved when they find out that he was shot with training bullets. Before leaving, Angel visits Arthur, who is lying unconscious in recovery. She reveals that she ran away because her father was physically abusing her. After she leaves, Arthur opens his eyes, having heard everything. Angered at how Angel was treated, Arthur walks down to the mall in his hospital robes, beats up Mr. Debrofkowitz at his store, throws him through the glass window of his shop, and stuffs him into a garbage can. After Dr. Park absorbs the story, she tells Arthur that what she admires most about him is his honesty, although she also says that there are better ways of dealing with someone like Mr. Debrofkowitz. A hearing prior to their meeting revealed that Paul came to defend Arthur after the issue at the mall, telling him about Arthur's delusions of being Defendor, and the judge mandated a psychological evaluation to determine if he can be returned to society or locked up in prison. A reporter approaches Paul and convinces him to let her run a story about Arthur as the Defendor, and he agrees in hopes of some positive approval ratings. People become inspired by Defendor's attempts to save lives and fight crime despite his personal risks and arrest. The judge orders Paul be Arthur's guide to reintroduce him to society, which is nearly ruined when news that he can never become Defendor again causes Arthur to nearly go ballistic. Depressed about having to leave Arthur, Angel becomes desperate for a hit, and tries to get back together with Dooney. However, knowing her affiliation with Defendor, he instead holds her hostage, and sends Arthur a threat to not reveal anything he had learned to the police. Arthur decides to take the risk to save Angel and once again dons his persona. Kat manages to escape Dooney by shooting off his testicles and the pair reunite. She is devastated when he reveals he still plans to go after Captain Industry, and tells him that she lied about the identity of Captain Industry due to a personal vendetta she has with him. She orders Arthur to take a gun she stole from Dooney for safety. He reveals his plans to the police but escapes before they can take him into custody again, leading a trail of road flares to the docks. Defendor manages to subdue Industry's henchmen, but does not defend himself against Industry who fatally shoots him. As Arthur lays dying, Angel runs to help him. She promises to stop smoking crack and to get a job outside of prostitution. In an earlier conversation Kat revealed she had always had a talent in writing, that Arthur had described as being ""like Lois Lane"". She promises to be like her and Arthur dies in her arms. Later, it is revealed that Dooney and Captain Industry were arrested for their crimes. Dooney is sentenced to 26 years in prison and Industry is extradited to a prison in his home country. Arthur's legacy lives on, as a memorial is held for Defendor under a spray paint mural that was drawn in his honor. Dr. Park and her daughter attend as well, remembering the man and inspired by the hero that no one could see. The last shot of the film is of Angel sitting at her typewriter, writing stories as a wasp flies into the room.crime fighter delusion superhero",False,tt1303828,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,44462,0,0,-77.7189060321173,39.7198236153607,-6876149.0,16123851.0,,,,,-9073590.0,1,5926410.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-17372578.0,0.0,627422.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3276916.0,-13223084.0,0.125,1.0,151278235.71911615

Between trying to keep the family farm up and running her job in the village shop, aided by the elderly and partly blind Mrs. Docherty, she also has three dutiful, yet boisterous children to look after, Norman, Megsie and Vincent. All of this she has to do while her husband is away at war. So when her children's two haughty and spoiled cousins, Cyril and Celia Gray are sent to live on their farm and another war is being fought between the two sets of children, she is in need of a little magic. She hears a mysterious voice telling her that she needs Nanny McPhee and, to her astonishment, Nanny McPhee appears on her doorstep one stormy night. Nanny McPhee arrives to take matters into her own hands. At first, the children do not listen and carry on fighting, but she calmly bangs her stick, causing them to start hurting themselves, and Vincent to break things with his cricket bat. Eventually, they apologise, and the two groups learn to tolerate each other. Nanny McPhee then teaches them another lesson, to share, and punishes them, by forcing the older boys to share their bed with a goat, the girls with the family cow, and Vincent with a baby elephant, making them realise sharing with one another wasn't so bad and start acting kinder to one another. For instance, Megsie gives Celia some of her best clothing when the ones she brought are ruined, which had made her resort to wearing their mother's wedding dress. Meanwhile, Isabel's brother-in-law Phil has gambled away the farm and is being chased down by two hit women. He desperately attempts to make Isabel sell her half of the farm, using an array of schemes. These include digging a hole so that the family piglets can escape, but by working together, the children manage to round them up in time. To celebrate catching the piglets, Mrs. Green takes all the children on a picnic, during which Mr. Docherty, warns them all about bombs and how he imagines a pilot might accidentally release his bomb in the remote area in which the family lives. At the end of the picnic Uncle Phil delivers a telegram saying that Rory Green has been ""killed in action"" in the war. Isabel believes the telegram, along with everybody else. But Norman does not, and says that he has a feeling ""in his bones"" that his father is not dead. He tells this to Cyril, who at first says it is just because he is upset, but then agrees to help Norman determine the truth. They realise that Cyril's father, Lord Gray, a high-ranking figure in the War Office can find out for himself what has happened to Rory. So they manage to get Nanny McPhee to take them to London on her motorcycle. Upon arrival in London, Nanny McPhee uses her status in the army to get the boys access to the War Office, where they meet Lord Grey. At first he scoffs at Norman when he tells him about his disbelief of his father's death, but after Cyril angrily informs his father that he knows that his parents are getting a divorce, he gives in and goes to check on Rory's status. While he is gone, Cyril tells Norman that he and Celia have been sent away because their parents will be splitting up, and not because of the bombs, and he is unsure where he and Celia will have to live. Norman tells Cyril that he and Celia are welcome to live on the farm with the Greens, to his delight. Lord Grey returns and informs them that Rory is not listed as killed in action, as the telegram had stated, but rather missing in action, and that there is no record of a telegram ever having been sent to Isabel. The boys then leave and Norman works out that the telegram brought to his mother by Uncle Phil was in fact a fraud to get Isabel to sell the farm. While the boys are at the War Office, Megsie, Celia and Vincent are trying to stop Isabel from signing the papers and selling the farm. When their own efforts fail, Megsie calls to Nanny McPhee for help, who hears her plea and summons a baby Elephant to stall for time. Just as Isabel is about to sign the papers, an enemy plane flies overhead. The pilot sneezes twice, and on the third sneeze, a huge bomb is dropped, but does not explode and is sticking out of the barley field. When Nanny McPhee returns with Norman and Cyril, thanks to the Nanny's magic, the children go out to watch Mr. Docherty dismantle the bomb, but he falls from the ladder and faints, and Megsie takes over. She succeeds with the help of the other children and Nanny McPhee's putty eating bird, Mr. Edelweiss. Nanny McPhee then helps to harvest the barley and saves Phil from the hit women, with a little magic, and she and Mrs. Docherty watch the family celebrate. During their conversation, Mrs. Docherty says to Mr. Docherty that Nanny McPhee hates goodbyes and that she remembers from when she was young. She then takes out a rattle, revealing that she is baby Aggie from the first film. As Nanny McPhee walks away from the now happy family, true to her statement ""When you need me, but do not want me, I must stay. When you want me, but no longer need me, then I have to go"", the children and Isabel chase after her, determined to prove they still need her. However, they discover that they in fact do not, as they round a bend to see that their father is descending from the hill, passing Nanny McPhee along the way. Rory Green , in army uniform and with an injured arm, runs to the arms of his children and wife and rejoices in the discovery that after leaving three children to go to war, he has returned to find five. As Nanny McPhee watches the reunion, now a beautiful woman, she forgives Mr. Edelweiss and allows him to perch on her shoulder as they leave into the distance.  In addition to emphasising discipline, manners and accepting the consequences of one's actions, Nanny McPhee has five very important base lessons to teach – each of which correspond to her various unattractive physical attributes: grey hair, two large moles, a unibrow, and a snaggle-tooth protruding over her bottom lip, all of which give her the appearance of a stereotypical witch. Nanny is as ugly as the children are naughty, so whenever a lesson is learned, one of her disfigurements vanishes. When all five lessons are learned, Nanny McPhee transforms from ugly to beautiful woman. *Lesson #1: To stop fighting – Upper wart disappears *Lesson #2: To share – Lower wart disappears *Lesson #3: To work together – Unibrow disappears *Lesson #4: To be brave – Hair changes from grey to brown *Lesson #5: To have faith – Snaggle tooth disappears and is now a beautiful woman.  *Courage - later awarded to Cyril *Kindness - later awarded to Celia *Resolve - later awarded to Megsie *Imagination - later awarded to Norman *Enthusiasm - later awarded to Vincent *Basket - work *Leaps of Faith - later awarded to Isabelnanny children aftercreditsstinger duringcreditsstinger woman director based on young adult novel",False,tt1415283,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,93246388,1,0,1.6641825142857145,-2.2977368060284267,,,44798146.75,83423146.75,85573332.42857143,112507189.57142857,42724066.72727273,21,67133157.63636364,11.0,5393406.0,3.0,13643406.0,2.0,177657186.0909091,14.0,221317165.0909091,11.0,448825555.5,8.0,549825555.5,2.0,140086358.42857143,25.0,166610501.2857143,7.0,70553952.0,11.0,114553952.0,5.0,23561398.0,6.0,39061398.0,2.0,16330482.0,10.0,26330482.0,1.0,,,,47482702.333333336,124149369.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,78481018.29166667,108933518.29166667,24.0,97489822.0,122489822.0,1.0,565013115.0,745013115.0,1.0,30159914.0,44509914.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,108036299.0,128536299.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,97489822.0,122489822.0,149809452.1891234,115641550.59334415,12.25,5.125,102557850.13709407

The new agent 007 then goes to Madagascar in pursuit of an international bomb-maker named Mollaka. After a parkour chase to an embassy, Bond kills his target and blows up a part of the building in order to escape. Searching through Mollaka's mobile phone, Bond discovers a text message which he traces to Alex Dimitrios, an associate of banker and terrorist financer Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre's investments involve short-selling stock in successful companies and then engineering terrorist attacks to sink their share prices. Bond travels to Dimitrios's house in the Bahamas and seduces his wife, Solange. While answering a phone call, Solange reveals that her husband is flying to Miami; Bond leaves to pursue him. In Miami, 007 kills Dimitrios during a fight and then follows Le Chiffre's henchman, Carlos, to Miami International Airport. There, Bond foils Le Chiffre's plan to destroy the prototype Skyfleet airliner. Left with a huge loss and under pressure to recoup his terrorist clients' money, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes Texas hold 'em tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. Hoping that a defeat would force Le Chiffre to aid the British government in exchange for protection from his creditors, MI6 enters Bond into the tournament. On the train to Montenegro, Bond meets an ally, Rene Mathis, and Vesper Lynd, a Treasury agent who is looking after the 10&nbsp;million buy-in. During the tournament, Bond loses his initial stake and Vesper refuses to give him 5&nbsp;million to continue playing. Distraught over his failure, Bond resolves to assassinate Le Chiffre. Before he can, a fellow player reveals himself as CIA agent Felix Leiter, who offers to stake Bond in exchange for custody of Le Chiffre. Back in the game, Bond begins to amass chips. Le Chiffre and his associates attempt to kill Bond by poisoning his drink, but he survives with the help of Vesper and wins the tournament, and the winnings are deposited into a Swiss bank account. Soon afterward, Le Chiffre abducts Vesper and uses her as bait to capture Bond. Le Chiffre tortures Bond for the access code to the game's winnings, but is interrupted by Mr. White, who kills Le Chiffre and his associates. Bond awakens in a hospital on Lake Como and orders Mathis, whom Le Chiffre identified as a double agent, arrested. Bond admits his love for Vesper, and posts his resignation to M. The couple then goes to Venice. There Bond learns that his poker winnings were never deposited in the Treasury's account. Realising that Vesper has stolen them, he pursues her and members of the organisation for which she is working into a building under renovation, which is being kept from sinking only by inflatable supports. A gunfight ensues and the supports are punctured. Bond kills the men and tries to rescue Vesper, but she locks herself in an iron-frame lift and allows herself to drown as the building sinks. Mr. White, watching from a nearby balcony, walks away with the money. Bond rejoins the service and learns that Vesper had a French-Algerian boyfriend who was kidnapped by the organisation behind Le Chiffre and Mr. White in order to blackmail her into co-operation, and that she agreed to deliver the money in exchange for saving Bond's life. Bond then discovers White's name and cell phone number which he uses to find him where he demands answers before wounding him and introducing himself: ""The name's Bond,...

His former superior, Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus , is pressured to oversee Operation Paragon and utilize Interpol's fictitious Huxley Huxley 600 computer, Aldous to find the world's greatest detective to solve the crime. What the world at large does not realise is that Clouseau was actually a bungling fool whose cases were solved more through luck than actual detective genius and that his accident-prone incompetence led Dreyfus to a series of nervous breakdowns. Anxious never to see or hear from his nemesis again, Dreyfus sabotages the computer to select the world's worst detective. This turns out to be Sergeant Clifton Sleigh ([[Ted Wass , an incompetent officer of the NYPD. Sleigh, who is descended from a long line of cops, sees the case as an opportunity to prove his worth. Dreyfus and his long-suffering assistant Sergeant François Durval  soon find that the sabotage has worked a bit too well: Sleigh is just as clumsy as Clouseau, tripping and falling, causing havoc and driving Dreyfus crazy. When Sleigh meets Dreyfus for the first time in his office, Sleigh trips over his own feet and knocks Dreyfus into his wheeled office chair which rolls out onto the balcony and sends Dreyfus falling three stories into a pond below, breaking his left leg. Later as Dreyfus goes insane again and attempts to murder Sleigh, he keeps injuring himself, leading to him breaking most of his bones and ending up in a body cast. As he sets out on the case, Sergeant Sleigh encounters many people who prefer Clouseau dead. These include the inspector's former manservant Cato  ; Dreyfus, who attempts to kill Sleigh like he tried to kill Clouseau; and Bruno Langlois , the mafia boss from Trail of the Pink Panther. Langlois orders several assassination attempts on Sleigh, but the detective's bumbling nature allows him to survive. Ultimately, Langlois, along with his henchmen  have a final showdown with Sleigh in a dark alley. Juleta Shayne , an employee of the enigmatic Countess Chandra comes to Sleigh's rescue and manages to defeat Langlois and his thugs in street combat. Sleigh also meets Sir Charles Lytton  who is now married to Clouseau's former wife Simone  and accompanied by his nephew George  . Sir Charles was the notorious jewel thief known as the Phantom, though only Clouseau was convinced of this. The Phantom would steal items of jewellery and leave behind a monogrammed white glove. Eventually the trail leads Sleigh to a health spa run by Countess Chandra . There he meets famous British film star,  who speaks with a rather odd French accent and falls about all over the place. Seeing a photograph of the Inspector, Countess Chandra tells Sleigh that Clouseau visited her several months ago, but claimed his name was Gino Rossi . She recalls he was looking for a good plastic surgeon and she recommended one. Sleigh concludes, wrongly, that Clouseau stole the Pink Panther diamond, underwent plastic surgery, and changed his name to Gino Rossi. The real jewel thief's body was found washed up on shore after he was shot to death. It is believed that Clouseau was killed for the diamond. Anxious to be rid of Sleigh, Dreyfus announces that Sleigh has solved the mystery and officially closes the case, though it is clear that Dreyfus does not believe that this is what happened. In a final irony, as Dreyfus sets fire to Gino Rossi's photograph, happy to be rid of Clouseau once and for all, he accidentally sets fire to his office. Sleigh runs in and attempts to put out the fire with a hose, only to accidentally hit Dreyfus with the water, the force of which pushes him onto his balcony and Dreyfus again falls three stories into the pond below. Film star Roger Moore was in fact Clouseau after very extensive plastic surgery. Clouseau has become Countess Chandra's lover and partner in crime. When Clouseau and Chandra open her hidden wall safe to admire the Pink Panther, they discover they have been robbed and a white monogrammed glove has been left behind. ""Swine Phantom!"" mutters Clouseau, knowing only too well who is responsible for the theft. In the final scene, Sir Charles, Simone, and George are sailing away on board their yacht, along with the Pink Panther jewel which Simone has stolen. In a post-credits scene, it shows the Pink Panther, in a cameo, stealing the Pink Panther jewel. Realizing it's heavy, he loses his balance and falls out of the scene, and drops the jewel, offscreen, the sound of the jewel being smashed, can be heard in the background, then the credits roll.robbery detective sequel jewel thief pink panther",False,tt0085384,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,4491986,0,0,-1.4488054949414355,6.872979369498223,,,,,97443764.11764705,108599646.47058824,19761600.666666668,22,28401600.666666668,3.0,,0.0,,,21187849.333333332,25.0,25443849.333333332,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,153401568.33333334,10.0,172984901.66666666,6.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32333274.0,37833274.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,32333274.0,37833274.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32333274.0,37833274.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19663107.333333332,25763107.333333332,3.0,32333274.0,37833274.0,75610117.22222222,64783672.77777778,7.125,4.0,70929371.26798174

Bond tells the banker King was buying a report stolen from an MI6 agent who was killed for it, and wants to know who killed him. The banker threatens Bond, but Bond overpowers him. The banker is killed by his assistant before he can reveal the assassin's name. Bond escapes with the money. Back in London, Sir Robert is killed by the booby-trapped money inside MI6. Bond gives chase to the assassin – the assistant again – by a boat on the Thames to the Millennium Dome, where the assassin attempts to escape via hot air balloon. Bond offers her protection, but she refuses. She detonates the balloon, killing herself. Bond traces the recovered money to Renard, a KGB agent-turned-terrorist. Following an earlier attempt on his life by MI6, Renard was left with a bullet in his brain which is gradually destroying his senses, making him immune to pain. M assigns Bond to protect King's daughter, Elektra; Renard previously abducted and held her for ransom, and MI6 believes that he is targeting her a second time. Bond flies to Azerbaijan, where Elektra is overseeing the construction of an oil pipeline. During a tour of the pipeline's proposed route in the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, paraglider-equipped snowmobiles. Afterwards Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky to acquire information about Elektra's attackers; he discovers that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is secretly in league with Renard. Bond kills Davidov and boards a plane bound for a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. There, Bond, posing as a Russian nuclear scientist, meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones and enters the silo. Inside, Renard removes the GPS locator card and a half quantity of weapons-grade plutonium from a bomb. Before Bond can kill him, Christmas blows his cover. Renard steals the bomb and flees, leaving everyone to die in the booby-trapped missile silo. Bond and Christmas escape the exploding silo with the locator card. Back in Azerbaijan, Bond discloses to M that Elektra may not be as innocent as she seems, and hands her the locator card as proof of the theft: an alarm sounds, revealing that the stolen bomb from Kazakhstan is attached to an inspection rig heading toward the oil terminal. Bond and Christmas enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Christmas discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of the rig and a large section of the pipe is destroyed. Bond and Jones are presumed killed. Back at the command centre, Elektra reveals that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard. She abducts M. Bond accosts Zukovsky at his caviar factory in the Caspian Sea – which is then attacked by Elektra's helicopters. Later, Zukovsky reveals his arrangement with Elektra was in exchange for the use of a submarine, currently being captained by Zukovsky's nephew, Nikolai. The group goes to Istanbul, where Bond and Zukovsky think that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. Elektra's pipeline is planned to go around Istanbul, dramatically increasing the value of her own oil. Bond then gets a signal from the locator card from the Maiden's Tower – just before Zukovsky's underling, Bullion blows up the command centre. Zukovsky is knocked unconscious, and Bond and Christmas are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Christmas is taken aboard the submarine, which was seized by Renard's men. Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a garrote. Zukovsky and his men seize the tower, but Zukovsky is shot by Elektra. The dying Zukovsky uses his cane gun to free Bond. Bond frees M and kills Elektra. Bond dives after the submarine, boards it and frees Christmas. Following a fight, the submarine starts to dive, and hits the bottom of the Bosphorus, causing its hull to rupture. Bond catches up with Renard and fights and kills him. Bond and Christmas escape the submarine, leaving the flooded reactor to detonate safely underwater.british mission oil heiress bilbao spain british secret service",False,tt0143145,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,361832400,1,0,1.6802400000000002,15.965307217698705,139744427.55555555,163169427.55555555,60598138.0,72658360.22222222,129251846.8,149661846.8,179768700.66666666,7,239102034.0,3.0,,0.0,,,85634536.0,3.0,92134536.0,3.0,,0.0,,,294194034.0,4.0,352194034.0,1.0,126603432.0,36.0,144603432.0,2.0,28516214.2,28.0,39916214.2,5.0,,0.0,,,,,,223011068.0,333011068.0,1.0,,,,,,,148489124.33333334,199155791.0,3.0,,,,,,,-13223826.666666666,13986173.333333334,3.0,106011914.22222222,141496358.66666666,9.0,,,,258602551.0,342602551.0,2.0,,,,-3347421.0,17619245.666666668,3.0,133645970.0,177360970.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,223011068.0,333011068.0,1.0,,,,169157737.57142857,202586309.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,89592597.5,134467597.5,4.0,,,,149018017.0,189018017.0,2.0,138915773.47368422,163002615.57894737,173590050.04,142943383.37333333,9.75,2.8,73407251.10798967

Ten years later, a young Warren Worthington III tries to cut off his wings. The next scene opens with the X-Men in battle against a giant robot in the Danger Room. Kitty Pryde and Colossus have joined the team, although Cyclops is absent. Storm insists on working as a team, but Wolverine has Colossus throw him as he cuts the giant robot's head off. Storm is upset with Logan for not working as part of a team. Sometime afterward, the pharmaceutical company Worthington Labs announces it has developed an inoculation to suppress the X-gene that gives mutants their powers and makes them different from other humans, offering the ""cure"" to any mutant who wants it. While some mutants are interested in the cure, including the X-Men's Rogue, many others are horrified by the announcement. In response to the news, the X-Men's adversary, Lensherr, now known as Magneto, raises an army, warning his followers that the ""cure"" will be forcefully used to exterminate the mutant race. Cyclops, still depressed about the loss of Jean, returns to Alkali Lake. Jean appears to Cyclops, but as the two kiss, Jean takes on a fearsome appearance. Psychically sensing trouble, Professor X sends Wolverine and Storm to investigate. When they arrive, the two X-Men encounter telekinetically floating rocks, Cyclops' glasses, and an unconscious Jean. Cyclops himself is nowhere to be found. Xavier explains that when Jean sacrificed herself, she unleashed the powerful alternate personality she calls ""Phoenix"". Wolverine is disgusted to learn that Xavier has kept Jean in check telepathically, but when Jean awakens, he realizes she is not the Jean Grey he knew. Jean pleads with Wolverine to kill her, but when he refuses, the Phoenix surfaces and knocks out Wolverine, before escaping to her childhood home. Magneto, alerted by Callisto to the presence of a powerful mutant, realizes that it must be Jean Grey. Magneto and his allies are already at Jean's childhood home when Xavier and his X-Men arrive. The two men vie for Jean's loyalty until the Phoenix resurfaces. She destroys her family's house, disintegrates Xavier, and leaves with Magneto. The X-Men regroup to confront Magneto's army, despite being significantly outnumbered. Magneto has diverted the Golden Gate Bridge to provide access to Alcatraz Island, the location of Worthington Labs facility. The military troops defending the facility are armed with plastic ""cure weapons"" able to neutralize the attacking mutants, and non-metallic to counter Magneto's powers. Magneto lets the lesser-powered mutants charge ahead, with heavy initial losses, but then they rapidly begin to overwhelm the troops. The X-Men Wolverine, Storm, Beast, Iceman, Colossus and Shadowcat arrive to battle Magneto and his troops. During the fight, Beast injects Magneto with the cure, nullifying his powers. Meanwhile, Shadowcat has entered the facility to find Jimmy who is the source of the cure and saves him from the murderous Juggernaut. They escape as Army reinforcements arrive, only to be obliterated by Phoenix, lashing out with her power and destroying everything around her including the lab itself. Wolverine realizes that due to his self-healing power, he is the only one who can approach her. He tells Storm to evacuate everyone and faces Phoenix alone, his power barely neutralizing her disintegration attack. Jean, momentarily gaining control, begs Wolverine to save her. Telling Jean he loves her, Wolverine kills her and holds her dead body as he weeps. The school continues without Xavier, with Storm now as headmistress and Logan as a teacher. The US president appoints Beast as ambassador to the United Nations, Rogue returns, telling Iceman she has taken the cure and the two hold hands skin-to-skin. The depowered Magneto sits at a chessboard in a park and reaches toward a metal chess piece that moves slightly. In a post-credits scene, Dr. Moira MacTaggert checks on a comatose patient who greets her with Xavier's voice.

After Moon's assistant Zao discovers Bond is a British agent, the colonel escapes in a hovercraft. Bond distracts the soldiers with an explosion, in which Zao's face is disfigured by diamond fragments. Bond pursues Moon in a second hovercraft. During the chase, Moon's hovercraft plunges down a waterfall, apparently killing him. Bond is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel's father, General Moon. After 14 months of captivity and torture, Bond is traded for Zao in a prisoner exchange. He is sedated and taken to meet M, who informs him that his status as a 00 Agent is suspended due to her belief that he may have leaked information under duress. Still bitter over Zao's release, Bond decides to complete his mission by evading MI6's security and travelling to Hong Kong, where he learns from his contact in the Chinese government that Zao is in Cuba.  After arriving in Havana, Bond meets NSA agent Giacinta 'Jinx' Johnson. Bond follows Zao and Jinx to a gene therapy clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Bond locates Zao inside the clinic and a fight ensues. Zao flees in a helicopter, but he leaves behind a pendant. Bond opens it and finds a cache of diamonds, identified as conflict diamonds, but bearing the crest of the company of British billionaire Gustav Graves. Bond encounters Graves, along with his assistant Miranda Frost, also an undercover MI6 agent, at Blades Club. After a fencing exercise, Bond is invited by Graves to Iceland for a scientific demonstration. Shortly afterwards, M restores Bond's Double-0 status and offers assistance in the investigation. In Iceland, Graves unveils a new orbital mirror satellite, ""Icarus"", which is able to focus solar energy on a small area and provide year-round sunshine for crop development. At midnight, Jinx infiltrates Graves' command centre in the palace, but is captured by Zao. Bond rescues her, and after seeing Zao talking with Graves, realises that Colonel Moon is still alive. Moon has used the gene therapy technology to change his appearance, assuming the identity of Gustav Graves. Bond confronts Graves, but Frost arrives to reveal herself as the traitor and the one who exposed Bond in North Korea, forcing 007 to escape from Graves' facility. Bond then returns in his Aston Martin Vanquish to rescue Jinx. Zao pursues them in his Jaguar XKR, both cars driving inside the rapidly-melting ice palace. Bond kills Zao by luring him under a collapsing ice chandelier, and then rescues Jinx from drowning.  Bond and Jinx pursue Graves and Frost to the Korean peninsula and stow away on Graves' cargo plane. Graves reveals his true identity to his father, and the purpose of the Icarus satellite: to cut a path through the Korean Demilitarized Zone with concentrated sunlight, allowing North Korean troops to invade South Korea and reunite the countries through force. Horrified, General Moon tries to stop the plan, but he is murdered by his own son. 007 attempts to shoot Graves but he is prevented by one of the soldiers on board. In their struggle, a gunshot pierces the fuselage, causing the plane to descend rapidly. Bond engages Graves in a fist fight, and Jinx attempts to regain control of the plane. Frost attacks Jinx, forcing her to defend herself in a sword duel. After the plane passes through the Icarus beam and is further damaged, Jinx kills Frost. Graves attempts to escape by parachute, but Bond opens the parachute, causing the slipstream to pull Graves out of the plane and into its engine, killing him and disabling the Icarus beam. Bond and Jinx escape the disintegrating plane by using a helicopter in the cargo hold. They carry away Graves' stash of diamonds.spy laser espionage british secret service havana cuba u.s. secret service agent space based weapon",False,tt0246460,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,431971116,1,0,2.085507971428572,0.06660377319308829,144328005.0526316,173625373.47368422,77221564.2,101575764.2,135350631.375,162922506.375,191534625.5,10,269784625.5,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-14340069.5,3.0,5159930.5,2.0,61568911.833333336,31.0,93568911.83333333,6.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,248012500.66666666,349012500.6666667,3.0,,,,28049560.0,143049560.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,176367070.375,222492070.375,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,143311604.8,172944104.8,122837822.6111111,79587822.6111111,5.5,4.0,95886927.05495417

While there, Bond witnesses a mysterious nurse named Fatima Blush giving a sadomasochistic beating to a patient in a nearby room. The man's face is bandaged and after Fatima finishes her beating, Bond sees the patient using a machine which scans his eye. Bond is seen by Blush and an attempt is subsequently made to kill him in the clinic gym: however Bond manages to defeat the assassin. Blush and her charge, a United States Air Force pilot named Jack Petachi, are operatives of SPECTRE, a criminal organisation run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Petachi has undergone an operation on his right eye to make it match the retinal pattern of the US President, which he uses to circumvent security at an American military base in England. While doing so, he replaces the dummy warheads in two cruise missiles with live nuclear warheads; SPECTRE then obtains the warheads to extort billions of dollars from NATO governments. Blush subsequently murders Petachi. Under orders from the Prime Minister, M reluctantly reactivates the double-0 section and Bond is assigned the task of tracking down the missing weapons. Before leaving, he is outfitted with several gadgets by Q Branch, including a fountain pen that shoots an explosive dart. He meets Domino Petachi, the pilot's sister, and her wealthy lover, Maximillian Largo, another SPECTRE agent. Bond follows Largo and his yacht to the Bahamas, where he spars with Fatima Blush and Largo. Bond is informed by Nigel Small-Fawcett of the British Consulate that Largo's yacht is now heading for Nice, France. There, Bond joins forces with his CIA counterpart, Felix Leiter. Bond goes to a beauty salon where he poses as an employee and, whilst giving Domino a massage, is informed by her that Largo is hosting an event at a casino that evening. At the charity event, Largo and Bond play a 3-D video game called Domination, which Bond ultimately wins; Bond then informs Domino of her brother's death. Bond returns to his villa to find Nicole, his French contact, dead, having been killed by Blush. After a vehicle chase on his motorbike, Blush captures Bond. Forced to write his memoirs putting her as his ""Number One"" sexual partner, Bond uses his MI6-issue fountain pen to shoot Blush. Bond and Felix then attempt to board Largo's motor yacht, the Flying Saucer, in search of the missing nuclear warheads. Bond becomes trapped and is taken, with Domino, to Palmyra, Largo's base of operations in North Africa. Largo punishes Domino for betraying him by auctioning her off to some passing Arabs. Bond subsequently escapes and rescues Domino. After her rescue, Domino and Bond reunite with Felix on a US Navy submarine and track Largo to a location known as The Tears of Allah, below a desert oasis. Bond and Leiter infiltrate the underground facility and a gun battle erupts between Felix's team and Largo's men in the temple. In the confusion Largo makes a getaway with one of the warheads. Bond catches and fights Largo underwater. Just as Largo tries to detonate the last bomb, he is killed by Domino, taking revenge for her brother's death. Bond then returns to the Bahamas with Domino.video game spy bahamas british stealing scuba diving scuba british secret service",False,tt0086006,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,160000000,1,0,3.4444444444444446,6.872979369498223,,,,,,,63881941.4,21,71092441.4,10.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,28905963.0,6.0,45239296.333333336,3.0,,0.0,,,-6000000.0,6.0,1000000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,9100000.0,11.0,12600000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15095386.666666666,39428720.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,16045115.0,20045115.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-10480540.0,16519460.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,123108747.84615384,134774132.46153846,32482934.433333337,23971976.1,5.5,3.75,70929371.26798174

Seeking a phone with which to call for help, Brad and Janet walk to a nearby castle, where they discover a group of strange and outlandish people who are holding an Annual Transylvanian Convention. Brad and Janet watch as the Transylvanians, servants and a tap-dancing groupie dance the film's signature song, ""Time Warp"". They are soon swept into the world of Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a self-proclaimed ""Sweet Transvestite"" from Transsexual, Transylvania. The ensemble of convention attendees also includes servants Riff Raff , his sister Magenta, and a groupie named Columbia. Frank claims to have discovered the ""secret to life itself"". His creation, Rocky Horror, is brought to life. The ensuing celebration is soon interrupted by Eddie , an ex-delivery boy, partial brain donor to Rocky, and Columbia's lover, who rides out of a deep freeze on a motorcycle. In a jealous rage, Frank corners him and kills him with an ice axe. He then departs with Rocky to a bridal suite off of the laboratory. Brad and Janet are shown to separate bedrooms where each is visited and seduced by Frank, who poses as Brad  and then as Janet . Janet, upset and emotional, wanders off to look for Brad, who she discovers, via a television monitor, is having a post-coital chat with Frank. She then discovers Rocky, cowering in his birth tank, hiding from Riff Raff, who has been tormenting him. While tending to his wounds, Janet becomes intimate with Rocky, as Magenta and Columbia watch from their bedroom monitor. After discovering that his creation is missing, Frank, Brad and Riff Raff return to the lab, where Frank learns that an intruder has entered the building. Dr. Everett Scott, Brad and Janet's old high school science teacher, has come looking for his nephew, Eddie, but Frank suspects that Dr. Scott investigates UFOs for the government. Upon learning of Brad and Janet's connection to Scott, Frank suspects them of working for him. Frank, Dr. Scott, Brad, and Riff Raff then discover Janet and Rocky together under the sheets in Rocky's birth tank, upsetting Frank and Brad. Rocky and the guests are served dinner, which they soon realise has been prepared from Eddie's mutilated body. Janet runs screaming into Rocky's arms and is slapped and chased through the halls of the castle by a jealous Frank. Janet, Brad, Dr. Scott, Rocky and Columbia all meet in Frank's lab, where Frank captures them with the Medusa Transducer, transforming them into statues. They are then forced to perform a live cabaret floor show and have a semi-orgy in the pool , with Frank as the leader. The performance is interrupted by Riff Raff and Magenta, who stage a coup and announce their plan to return to their home planet. In the process, they kill Columbia, Rocky and Frank. They release Brad, Janet and Dr. Scott, and then depart by lifting off in the Castle itself. The narrator then finishes the film by concluding that the human race is equivalent to insects crawling on the planet's surface.transvestism transylvania sex rock 'n' roll time warp castle based on play or musical cult film audience participation dark and stormy night",False,tt0073629,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,112892319,1,0,93.0769325,44.936812380342076,4628948.0,5028948.0,32117500.0,50475000.0,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13300000.0,21000000.0,1.0,,,,,0.0,,65707483.04837625

One night, as Kevin is sleeping, an armoured knight on a horse bursts forth from his wardrobe. Kevin is scared and hides as the knight rides off into a forest setting where once his bedroom wall was; when Kevin looks back out, the room is back to normal, and he finds one of his photos on the wall similar to the forest he saw. He prepares a satchel with supplies and Polaroid camera for the next night. He is surprised when six dwarfs spill out of the wardrobe. Kevin quickly learns the group has stolen a large, worn map, and are looking for an exit in Kevin's room before they are discovered. They find that Kevin's bedroom wall can be pushed revealing a long hallway. Kevin is hesitant to join until the visage of an evil-looking head - the Supreme Being - appears behind them, demanding the return of the map. Kevin and the dwarves fall into an empty void at the end of the hallway. They land in Italy during the Napoleonic Wars. As they recover, Kevin learns that Randall is the lead dwarf, along with Fidgit, Strutter, Og, Wally, and Vermin. They were once employed by the Supreme Being to repair holes in the spacetime fabric, but instead realized the potential to use the map to steal valuable riches. With the map and Kevin's help, they visit several locations in spacetime, and meet figures such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Robin Hood; Kevin uses his camera to document their visits. They are unaware that their activities are being monitored by Evil, a malevolent sorcerer, who is able to manipulate reality and is attempting to acquire the map himself. Through Evil's actions, Kevin becomes separated from the group and ends up in Mycenaean Greece, and meets King Agamemnon; after Kevin inadvertently helps Agamemnon kill a minotaur, the king treats him as his own son, something that Kevin would be content with. Randall and the others soon locate Kevin and abduct him, much to his resentment. They arrive on the ill-fated RMS Titanic; after it sinks, they are forced to tread water while they argue amongst each other. Evil manipulates the group and transports them to his realm, the Time of Legends. The dwarfs locate the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness, and are led to believe that ""The Most Fabulous Object in the World"" awaits them, luring them into Evil's trap. Evil takes the map and locks the group into a cage over an apparent bottomless pit. While looking through the Polaroids he took, Kevin finds one that includes the map, and the group realises there are numerous holes in the Fortress they can use to recruit help to fight Evil. They make quick work of escaping from the cage and set their plan into motion. Though they far outnumber Evil, Evil's powers quickly defeat all of the allied forces. As Kevin and the dwarves cower, Evil prepares to unleash his ultimate power. Suddenly, he is turned into stone and explodes; from the smoke, an elderly, well-dressed figure emerges, revealed as the true form of the Supreme Being. He orders the dwarfs to collect all the pieces of concentrated evil warning that they can be deadly if not contained, recovers the map, and allows the dwarves to rejoin him in his creation duties. The Supreme Being disappears with the dwarfs, leaving Kevin stranded behind as one missed piece of concentrated Evil begins to emit smoke. Kevin passes out but awakes, back in his bedroom, his room filled with smoke. Firefighters break down the door and rescue him as they put out a fire in his house. One of the firemen finds that his parents' new microwave caused the fire. As Kevin recovers, he finds one of the firemen resembles Agamemnon, and discovers that he still has the photos from his adventure. As his parents look at a strange piece of rock in the microwave, Kevin tries to warn them off that it is a piece of concentrated evil and they should not touch it; nevertheless, both do, and suddenly explode and disappear, leaving Kevin wondering where they have gone off to.dwarf treasure map magic robin hood time travel napoleon titanic cage pig satire steampunk minotaur independent film good vs evil tank burglary cult film arm wrestling ancient greece giant ogre turned into animal",False,tt0081633,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,42365581,0,0,7.4731162,4.391301574055172,16045115.0,20045115.0,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,36101176.25,5.0,43226176.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4628948.0,5028948.0,1.0,,,,,,,16045115.0,20045115.0,1.0,,,,,,,16045115.0,20045115.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16045115.0,20045115.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,43226176.25,36101176.25,0.625,4.0,59926399.23225083

They are Omar , the leading straight man who is deeply critical of Western society and imperialism; his dim-witted friend, Waj ; Barry , a bad-tempered and extremely rash White convert to Islam; and naive Faisal , who tries to train crows to be used as bombers. While Omar and Waj go to a terrorist training camp in Pakistan, Barry recruits a reluctant fifth member, Hassan . The visit to the training camp ends in disaster, with Omar misfiring a rocket that kills fellow jihadists; however, he uses the experience to assert authority on his return to Britain. The group begins acquiring materials for making improvised explosive devices but disagree about what to target. Barry wants to bomb a local mosque as a false flag operation to ""radicalise the moderates"", but Omar considers this idiotic. Faisal suggests blowing up a branch of the pharmacy chain Boots, but Omar states it is a not a worthwhile target. Hassan allows an oblivious neighbour  into their safe house; the group think they have been compromised and transport their volatile explosives to a new location in grocery bags. Faisal accidentally trips in a field, while carrying the explosives, and blows up. This causes a row among the remaining four, who disband; but they reconcile, and Omar decides to target the upcoming London Marathon. Wearing mascot costumes to conceal their explosives—Omar as the Honey Monster; Waj as a man riding an ostrich; Barry as a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle; and Hassan as an inverted clown —they prepare to attack. Waj expresses doubts about the rectitude of the plot, but Omar convinces him to go ahead. Hassan loses his nerve and tries to alert nearby police officers, but Barry detonates his bomb using a mobile phone, killing Hassan, the police and alerting the authorities to the remaining three. Omar realises he has led an unwitting Waj into something he does not want to do, and sets off to make him change his mind. Police attempt to shoot Omar as he mingles with other runners but, instead, shoot a bystander dressed as a Wookiee. Omar eventually contacts Waj from his mobile phone but is attacked by Barry, who swallows the phone's SIM card. However, Barry begins to choke on it, causing a passer-by to carry out the Heimlich manoeuvre and detonate his bomb. Waj is cornered by police and takes a kebab shop hostage. Omar then borrows a phone and attempts to talk Waj down. However, his call is interrupted by a police raid in which they shoot a hostage whom they mistake for Waj. Confused, Waj detonates his bomb, destroying the kebab shop. Distraught, Omar walks into a nearby pharmacy and detonates his own bomb. It is revealed later that the police have arrested Omar's innocent and peaceful brother as a terrorist; that they deflect responsibility for shooting the bystander; and that Omar and Waj killed Osama Bin Laden when Omar fired his rocket backwards in Pakistan.muslim northern england satire yorkshire dark comedy farce terrorism cult film suicide bomber",False,tt1341167,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,4658570,1,0,3.8141339236074514,-2.2977368060284267,,,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,71268015.5,3.0,103768015.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-2361876.0,2743594.0,4.0,,,,5796544.0,8176544.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,103768015.5,71268015.5,0.375,2.0,102557850.13709407

Acheson has spent years hunting Elise's old lover, Alexander Pearce, who owes £744 million in back taxes and is believed to have received 20 million dollars worth of plastic surgery to alter his appearance completely. At a cafe, Elise receives written instructions from Pearce: board a train to Venice, pick out a man who resembles Pearce, and make the police believe that this decoy is Pearce himself. Elise burns the note, then manages to evade the police and board the train. On the train, Elise picks Frank Tupelo, a U.S. community college teacher. She spends much time with him, seeming to start a romance. In the meanwhile, the police have managed to salvage the ashes of her burned note and assembled them to extract information regarding her rendezvous as well as her ruse. But an informer from the police station mistakenly communicates to Reginald Shaw, a gangster from whom Pearce as accountant stole 2.3 billion, that Pearce is travelling with Elise on the train to Venice. Shaw immediately proceeds to Venice. Elise invites Frank to stay with her at the hotel room that has been arranged for her in Venice. Pearce leaves further instructions for Elise to attend a ball. Elise abandons Frank, who is then chased by Shaw's men. While trying to escape from them, Frank is detained by the Italian police ostensibly for his own safety, only to have a corrupt inspector turn him over to Shaw's men in exchange for the bounty that has been placed on Pearce's head. Elise rescues Frank just before he is handed over, leading Shaw's men on an extended boat chase and escaping. She leaves Frank at the airport with his passport and money, urging him to go home for his own safety. Elise is revealed to be one of Scotland Yard's agents who may have become Pearce's ally. Because of her fears for Frank, she agrees to participate in a sting operation. At the ball, as Elise wanders around trying to spot Pearce in the crowd, an envelope is placed on the table in front of her by a man who then quickly disappears into the crowd. Elise sees that the envelope is for her, and believes that the man must be Pearce himself. She tries to follow him through the crowd, calling out his name, but is stopped by Frank who has managed to enter inside under a pretext. Frank claims to be in love with her, and invites her to dance with him. But he is hauled away by the police, while Elise opens the envelope and finds a note mentioning a rendezvous point. She then heads off in her boat to this new rendezvous point. Shaw and his men tail her in their boat; both parties are followed discreetly by the police boat in which Frank is held handcuffed to stop him from obstructing the investigation. When Elise arrives at the destination, Shaw takes her prisoner, threatening to harm her unless she reveals the location of the stolen money. The police monitor the situation inside the rendezvous room through audio and video links. Despite Elise's peril, Acheson repeatedly turns down police requests to intervene with their snipers. While the police are occupied in monitoring the situation, Frank escapes from the police boat and confronts Shaw, claiming to be Pearce who has undergone plastic surgery and offering to open the safe if Elise is allowed to leave safely. Shaw is skeptical and makes a counter offer that Frank should open the safe if he does not want to see Elise being cut up. Chief Inspector Jones  arrives at the police stake-out, overrides Acheson, and orders the police snipers to fire into the room, killing Shaw and his men. Jones lifts Elise's suspension and also terminates her employment. Acheson receives a radio message that Pearce has been found not far from the rendezvous point, and rushes to the location where police have detained the suspect. But the man claims to be just a tourist who has merely been following instructions texted to his mobile phone, to be present at certain locations, for which he has been receiving payments. Meanwhile, Elise tells Frank that she loves him, but she also loves Pearce. Frank then suggests a ""solution"" to this dilemma; to Elise's surprise, he opens the safe by entering the correct code, thus revealing that he is really Alexander Pearce. He and Elise then take the money and depart, leaving a cheque in the safe for the full amount of the taxes he owes. The police find the cheque when they return and blow the safe open. Acheson now realizes that Frank has indeed been Pearce all along, and wants to pursue him; but Jones determines that, with the taxes now paid fully, Pearce's only crime is that he stole money from a now-dead gangster. Jones orders the case to be closed. Frank and Elise sail away to a new life together, with Elise taking in and getting used to the new and completely altered face of her old lover.paris, france hotel false identity undercover agent",False,tt1243957,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,278731369,1,0,1.78731369,-2.2977368060284267,56938690.59259259,94275727.62962963,38314299.5,93314299.5,121165.0,15121165.0,121810992.71428572,24,167668135.57142857,7.0,16172786.75,7.0,100172786.75,4.0,741638.2,12.0,29541638.2,5.0,137676456.0,23.0,173676456.0,2.0,160000000.0,27.0,187500000.0,1.0,31766123.333333332,14.0,76432790.0,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,94013509.0,173013509.0,1.0,50173623.75,116423623.75,4.0,,,,,,,354640427.0,457640427.0,1.0,,,,,,,88479216.0,167979216.0,2.0,109426556.57142857,147747985.14285713,14.0,,,,54478416.0,104478416.0,1.0,,,,109168700.0,194168700.0,1.0,102000000.0,152000000.0,1.0,47814855.0,101148188.33333333,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,96056811.5,178556811.5,2.0,45464324.0,65464324.0,1.0,182140134.25,284240134.25,8.0,,,,383488494.6666667,460488494.6666667,3.0,74981604.0,167731604.0,4.0,,,,,,122498634.42023809,78027999.49960318,13.375,3.6666666666666665,102557850.13709407

Woody is a popular varsity football player while Nell is a nerdy, literature-loving girl. They loathe each other and are constantly in dispute. One day their class goes on a school trip to a museum and they are forced to work together on an assignment. They quickly begin arguing in front of a statue of the ancient Aztec god Tezcatlipoca.{{cite web}} As they argue, the statue casts a spell upon them — causing them to wake up in each other's bodies the next morning. When they arrive at school, they immediately blame each other for the body swap, but agree to pretend to be the other person until they can find a way to switch back. At first, they seem to succeed, but quickly return to arguing when they each feel the other is misrepresenting them in the opposite body, such as Nell  answering a question oddly and surprising a teacher. The following day, Nell  arrives at school wearing ""Chinos and an Oxford cotton button-down"" making Woody's appearance look ""dorky"" which frustrates Woody, and he is even more frustrated after he hears about how Nell  failed Woody's football practice the previous day. As payback, Woody  dresses in inappropriate and provocative clothing the following day. After school, Nell , in retaliation, breaks up with Breanna , Woody's girlfriend, much to the disappointment of Woody. The humiliation competition continues when Woody  drives off with a biker boy, Nicky , and makes Nell  think she is going to lose her virginity. However, Woody decides it is ""so gay"" and leaves Nicky just as he is removing his clothing. The following day, rumors are being spread around school by Nicky about his night with Nell. When Nell  finds out, she gets very upset. When Woody  finds Nell , he admits that he didn't actually lose Nell's virginity and that everyone was simply spreading Nicky's lies. However, Nell is still let down and so Woody  decides to confront Nicky. It turns out that Woody  can't fight him, and Nell  runs up and punches him in the face. After this, Nell and Woody reach a truce and realize the statue of Tezcatlipoca at the museum had something to do with their body swap. They head down to the museum and even after confronting the statue, they fail to return to their original bodies. They realize they are going to have to help each other in two important upcoming events. Nell must learn how to play football for Woody's Homecoming game and Woody must learn about poetry and literature for Nell's Yale interview. Later that night Nell  is getting drunk at a party while Woody  is stuck at a slumber party listening to all the gossip about Woody, and surrounded by nailpolish, pajamas and slippers. After spending so much time together, Nell and Woody become very fond of each other and start to understand each other better. The night before the interview and the game, they agree to go to the Homecoming Dance together, as ""not a date."" The day of the interview and match, Woody goes to Yale for the interview and at first messes things up and is asked to leave, but he starts to talk about poetry in rap, which impresses and astonishes the interviewer. After that, he goes to the match and watches Nell run in the winning touchdown in the closing seconds. A college recruiter witnesses his good performance and wants to talk to him later. After the game, they congratulate each other for their successes. Shortly after this, the spell lifts and they return to their original bodies. The scene finishes with Woody being kissed by Breanna and Nell going home very upset about it. The following day, Woody tries to talk to Nell but is stopped by her mother, who sees Woody's family as uneducated. Nell receives a letter from Yale informing her that she has been accepted to Yale, meaning that her interview  was successful. However, she is still upset with Woody and has decided not to go to the Homecoming Dance. Meanwhile, Nell's father has a talk with her on the porch about Woody, during which she confesses she truly likes him, and her father surprises her with a dress and shoes for the dance. At the dance, Woody sees Nell and they leave the school together and share a kiss in front of their houses. The following day, Nell tells her mother that she is taking a year's sabbatical before attending Yale, and hops into Woody's car as they drive off together.interview high school love neighbor curse school spell teenager popularity body-swap teen comedy homecoming public humiliation soul transference",False,tt0482527,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,7385434,0,0,-1.098725680846921,-3.847336948521819,-13029732.0,1970268.0,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,68837820.0,7.0,106837820.0,2.0,,0.0,,,-10618335.0,0.0,1381665.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,54109742.5,29109742.5,0.875,1.5,92887866.92008553

Then men bearing crosses drove the heathens to the fringes of the earth. A mysterious mute Norse warrior only known as One-Eye , is held captive up above in misty highlands by a Chieftain , where he is forced to fight to the death against other captives. While One-Eye is imprisoned, a young boy tends to him regularly, bringing him food and water. One-Eye is shown to have the ability to foresee events in his dreams; a dream of him bathing in a pond leads him to discover an arrowhead on the bottom of a bed of water. Using the arrowhead, he breaks free, slaughters everyone except for The Boy and a warrior whom he lets escape. As One-Eye kills the last of his slavers the man shouts angrily at One-Eye that he will go back to hell. He finds the chieftain and places his head on a nithing pole, a magical rite Norse pagans used to place a curse upon someone.  While leaving the land, One-Eye soon realizes that The Boy is pursuing him. They reach a small group of Crusaders, Christians fresh from killing and enslaving pagans as they get ready to go on a crusade to Jerusalem. The leader of the group, The General , asks One-Eye to join him. He reasons that, live or die, One-Eye may cleanse his soul of sin by committing to the Crusades. The General, who has been told that The Boy has been a slave, asks him what he wants to now do and The Boy tells him he wishes to go home, but he does not know where home is. The General asks The Boy if he knows about One-Eye's origin. The Boy tells him that One-Eye was brought up from hell which, he has been told, lies on the other side of the ocean. It is left untold if he is talking about the Christian hell or hel: the underworld of Norse mythology.  The Crusaders, The Boy, and One-Eye are on a boat destined for Jerusalem. The crew is broken, thirsty and hungry, and with no wind for several days. A thick fog shrouds them constantly, preventing them from determining their direction or location. Lost, the crew begins to believe that the voyage is cursed, which some attribute to the presence of One-Eye's companion, The Boy. Mutiny nearly arises as a crew member who attempts to murder The Boy is killed by One-Eye. Later, sensing a change, One-Eye takes a drink from the water and discovers that the boat is actually in an estuary and no longer at sea. With the fog dissipating, the crew sees the first sight of land off in the distance.  Upon landing, to their surprise, the Holy Land is not the half-dry place they expected the Near East to be. Rather, it resembles a taiga with vast forests full of lakes and mountains. The crew sets out to explore the area, finding no animals to hunt, and no food to eat. Nearly starved, the crew continues until coming across some aboriginal burial sites. One of the crew members  leaves the group to venture on his own. The group searches for him for hours and some blame One-Eye as his killer. The General reasons that there is no proof of One-Eye killing him. Realizing they have not reached Jerusalem, the crew prepares the ship to depart and head home. While on water, the group is taunted by a single arrow, killing one of their men. Terrified, they soon come to believe that they are in Hell.  Upon reaching a nearby shore, the men drink a psychotropic brew given to them by their leader. One-Eye's dreams begin to intensify. He wades to a small island to construct a cairn. Meanwhile, the other men separate experiencing a variety of emotions, including apathy, desperation and despair. Some pray, others wander, others wait. One-Eye and the group are then confronted by a lost crew member who emerges from the forest naked and his skin covered in mud in which runes are drawn. The Lost One says he can hear One-Eye's thoughts, and translates that the warrior is saying they are in Hell. One of the crew members has become completely disillusioned and accuses The General of lying to him. He then declares there is no God and proceeds to attack One-Eye. One-Eye kills him and several other crew members who attack him.  Arrows from the forest continue to taunt and kill those left behind, soon after the band breaks up. As the priest ([[Gary Lewis leaves to follow One-Eye, the General stabs him and declares that he will stay and create a new Jerusalem. The Lost One laughs at him. The wounded priest and the General's son , follow One-Eye to the top of a tall hill. The Priest sits down. After talking to One-Eye, the General's son goes back to his father knowing the man is probably dead and that he too will die. As One-Eye leaves, The Boy looks at The Priest, expecting him to follow. The Priest stays behind, giving the boy a warm smile and knowing the child will be safe with One-Eye. The Priest is mortally wounded, seen with flies buzzing nearby, viewing the valley landscape, when an aura of light surrounds him. One-Eye and The Boy successfully reach the coastline and are soon met by a large tribe of Native American  warriors.

Alice is taken to a soundproofed room, and forcibly attached to a bed by her wrists and ankles with handcuffs and rope. Every article of her clothing is removed or cut off, and a ballgag is buckled into place. Once she is naked, she is photographed. Unknown to Vic, Danny and Alice are in a relationship and Danny plans to keep all the ransom money for Alice and himself. Alice hates her father for cutting her out of her inheritance, therefore Danny assumes that she will be happy with his plan. She must not be informed about the plan, nor about Danny's identity; she has to be genuinely frightened, otherwise Vic would become suspicious. While Vic is away, and Danny is guarding the imprisoned Alice, she manages to grab his gun, which she fires into the wall. When she points the gun at Danny, he is forced to reveal his identity to her, and explain the plan. She is angry, but agrees to play along, for fear of Vic killing them both. Danny finds the empty shell on the floor and has to swallow it to hide it from Vic. Later, when Vic is away once more, Danny and Alice appear to be about to share an intimate moment. However, Alice exploits the situation to handcuff Danny naked to the bed and pick up the gun, which Danny eventually manages to take off her. Vic returns and finds a mobile phone on Alice's person showing that she has managed to call the police. He also finds the bullet in the wall and he forces Alice to tell him about Danny's plan. Vic is shocked that Danny has deceived him, even more so because the two of them are lovers, observing that Danny could not have faked his arousal. Vic shoots Danny in the forest where the money was supposed to be handed over. Vic then goes to Alice who has been locked up in a warehouse. He tries to give her an injection but the wounded Danny overcomes him and shoots him instead, taking the ransom money and leaving Alice there alone. Before Vic dies, he gives keys to Alice, who manages to escape. She then finds Danny outside the warehouse, also dead, and drives off with the money.sex bondage ransom kidnapping father rich",False,tt1379177,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,867714,1,0,0.0846425,39.7198236153607,,,-7153168.25,10846831.75,,,386090727.0,1,586090727.0,1.0,,0.0,,,2300000.0,5.0,13300000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,814082016.0,926582016.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,-37143106.5,15356893.5,2.0,5078241.0,35078241.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,2764758.0,6814758.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-16062130.0,23937870.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,299695363.5,194195363.5,2.0,1.0,151278235.71911615

Not long afterwards, he breaks his word and begins a bloody campaign of revenge against the barons who humiliated him, commanding an army of Danish mercenaries to whose leader he has promised that the Pope would keep his missionaries out of Denmark. The abbot Marcus, leading three Templar knights who have taken vows of silence, shelters from a storm at Darnay Castle on his way to Canterbury for pilgrimage. Abbot Marcus speaks with Thomas Marshall, one of the knights and promises he will secure Marshall's release from the Templar Order once they reach Canterbury. The next morning, King John arrives with his Danish army and overruns the castle. John orders Darnay hanged, and Abbot Marcus has his tongue cut out by the Danes when he tries to intervene. Marshall and the two other knights fight the Danes, during which Marshall manages to escape the castle on horseback, carrying the abbot, while the other two knights are slain. The abbot dies of his wounds shortly after, and Marshall breaks his vow of silence to swear that his sacrifice will not be in vain. Once he has reached Canterbury, Marshall meets with Archbishop Langton, the author of the Magna Carta, and Baron William d'Aubigny, a former soldier turned wool merchant. Langton reveals that the Pope has sided with King John and that he himself is to be excommunicated for writing the Great Charter. The three men agree that John must be stopped, and that the place to do it is Rochester Castle, a strategically important stronghold that controls the route from southern England.  Aubigny persuades three of his men to join him, including his squire Guy, but a fourth turns down the baron's call to arms. A party of seven finally leaves for Rochester where, on arriving, they discover six of the King Danish mercenaries have already claimed the castle after the fourth man had betrayed them to the king. Aubigny's party fights and kills the Danish scouts and then claims Rochester Castle in the name of the rebellion, much to the displeasure of Baron Cornhill, its lord. When John's army finally arrives and lays siege to Rochester, the garrison holds fast and manages to beat back the initial Danish assault. In the aftermath, Aubigny offers his men the chance to leave if they wish; none accept. For the second assault the Danes build a siege tower, but the defenders destroy it with a makeshift trebuchet and the attackers are repulsed again. The King's army holds back and begins to starve the defenders out. The Archbishop is informed that Prince Louis is biding his time in France and negotiating with John, and sets off immediately to expedite affairs. As weeks become months and the hunger and suffering of the castle's occupants increase, Marshall leaves under cover of night and steals food from the Danish camp, making it back just ahead of his pursuers. The defenders' morale is bolstered for the first time in months, and Marshall finally succumbs to the advances of Cornhill's wife Isabel, breaking his Templar vows. The Danish leader, Tiberius, under pressure from John to take the castle or risk the King reneging on their bargain, adopts a different approach in his next assault and manages to sneak a small force of men over the walls before dawn to open the castle gates from within. Guy discovers the infiltrators and sounds the alarm, but it is too late. Tiberius leads the charge into the castle grounds while his Danes slaughter the garrison. During the chaos d'Aubigny is wounded and left behind in the chaos of the retreat. Marshall recovers in time to don his knight's battle armor and charge the Danes on his war-horse, buying time for the survivors to pull back to the keep. Aubigny is dragged before the King and forced to watch as the hands of two prisoners are chopped off. After a defiant verbal exchange with John, he is subjected to the same fate and then killed by being flung from the makeshift trebuchet against the keep walls. Cornhill tries to surrender but after being stopped, he goes upstairs to his bedroom and hangs himself instead. John's royal engineers then collapse part of the keep after tunneling under its foundations, and the final assault begins. The last defenders are killed except Guy, Isabel and Marshall, knocked unconscious by rubble from the keep's collapse. Guy goes out to die fighting where he encounters Tiberius and is almost killed until a recovered Marshall intervenes. Tiberius challenges Marshall to single combat, and Marshall triumphs after an exhausting duel. Horns are heard in the distance as the combined English rebel and French army arrives at last, and John and the remaining Danes disperse in panic. Marshall meets Prince Louis and Archbishop Langton at the castle gates; the latter tells him that he is now free of the Templar Order. Acknowledging England's new king with a nod, Marshall rides off with Isabel, while Guy tells his dead baron that ""We held"". The film ends with an epilogue describing King John's death during his retreat and the reconstruction of Rochester Castle, and how it, like the Magna Carta, still stands today.ambush hero fight castle battlefield knight duel king order of the templars knight templars 13th century",False,tt1233301,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,5297411,0,0,-3.7192864589891177,1.026708649479613,,,,,,,-22033074.5,7,11966925.5,2.0,4309665.0,3.0,20809665.0,2.0,33299407.333333332,16.0,76191074.0,6.0,,0.0,,,114846145.0,16.0,179346145.0,4.0,244041713.2,22.0,278641713.2,5.0,29502807.0,19.0,48262807.0,5.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-18341708.666666668,31658291.333333332,3.0,73939692.25,170439692.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,57082069.333333336,103415402.66666667,3.0,-20355892.0,4644108.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,102536388.28333333,67327777.17222223,10.375,4.0,83145037.44008958

When stopping for something to eat they meet two rednecks and when Graeme laughs with them they start tormenting him. They leave quickly and dent the rednecks' truck. At night, along the highway, they notice lights following them. Wrongly thinking the lights to be from the rednecks' dented truck they speed up, but it's actually a car that passes them and then crashes. They investigate the damaged car, and discover an alien named Paul , who is in desperate need of help. Although shocked by the appearance of Paul, Graeme agrees to give Paul a ride, but Clive  is displeased about not being consulted about the idea. Later, United States Secret Service Agent Lorenzo Zoil  arrives at the site of the crashed car and informs his mysterious female superior, called the ""Big Guy"", over the radio that he is closing in on Paul, and she recommends using local law enforcement as back-up. She then recruits two inept rookie agents, Haggard  and O'Reilly , to aid in his mission, without informing them about the nature of their target. Zoil assures the Big Guy he can handle the problem himself, but the rookies are employed anyway. Graeme, Clive and Paul pull into an RV park run by Ruth Buggs , a Christian fundamentalist, and her over-bearing father, Moses . The trio bond around their camp grill and Paul reveals that since he was captured by the government, he had been advising them in all manner of scientific and sociological achievements. Having divulged everything that he knows, Paul has outlived his usefulness as a receptacle of knowledge, thus his captors intended to surgically remove Paul's brain and harvest his stem cells, in an attempt to harness his physical abilities . With the help from a friend inside Area&nbsp;51, Paul sent an SOS to his home planet and was escaping to rendezvous with them. The next morning, Paul intentionally reveals himself to Ruth during a theological discussion which turns into an argument, and the trio are forced to kidnap her and make a hasty escape. Moses sees Paul while the alien is trying to collect Clive's passport , and, believing him to be a demon, grabs his shotgun and chases after them in his truck. Paul shatters Ruth's faith by sharing his knowledge of the universe via a telepathic link; at first horrified, Ruth suddenly becomes eager to sin, which her father had raised her to fear doing. She initially does not trust Paul, but he heals her left eye, in which she was blind from the age of four. When the foursome stop at a bar to rest, Ruth tries to make a phone call to her dad, but Zoil answers, as part of the operation to capture Paul. At the end of the phone call, in which Ruth gives no information, she runs into the rednecks, who show an ill-received interest in her. She evades them, and informs Graeme and Clive they need to leave. At this point, the rednecks run into the men again, and a fight starts. Moses is also at the bar, and he sees Ruth, but notices her eye. As he is so stunned, he fails to react and loses track of the trio as they dash for the RV. The rednecks chase them down, but Paul appears outside the RV. The two rednecks faint and they drive away. Later that night, Paul, Graeme, Ruth and Clive sit down together near an RV park. Ruth falls asleep but goes back to the RV. In the morning, Graeme and Clive find it difficult to hide Paul from a busy town. Paul goes into a comic book store with Clive as Graeme goes to pick up Ruth. Paul has to pose as a statue there while they wait. Meanwhile, Ruth was asked questions by Agent Zoil, but lied and said she knew nothing of a one-eyed girl or two British ""nerds"". She and Graeme then drive into town to pick up Clive and Paul, but Paul had been exposed after he was caught by O'Reilly. Clive and Paul jump into the RV and narrowly escape the town; Haggard and O'Reilly report to Zoil. The rookies are asked to return to the base, but they want to catch the alien themselves. Moses is also in town, still trying to steal Ruth back, so he chases the RV. Clive and Graeme stop to buy fireworks at a shop but end up stealing them after Clive realizes they have no more American money. Paul eventually reveals his intention to return to Tara Walton , a girl whose dog he crashed his ship on in 1947 and who subsequently saved his life, who is now an old woman. After spending her life being ridiculed for what she said she saw, Tara is grateful to see that Paul exists. She turns her gas cooker on to make tea, but is interrupted by Haggard and O'Reilly on one side of the house, and Zoil on the other. As the motley crew escapes and drives off with Paul, O'Reilly shoots at them, and the gas ignites, destroying Tara's house and killing O'Reilly. A winded Zoil attempts to follow, but Haggard takes off first, shooting at Moses, running him off the road and catching up to the RV. However, due to an error in judgement, Haggard accidentally drives off a cliff and is killed, leaving Zoil as the last remaining agent in pursuit. He reassures the Big Guy that he will have Paul within an hour, but she declares herself tired of waiting, and informs Zoil that she has ordered a military response. When Paul, Graeme, Clive, Ruth and Tara arrive at the rendezvous, they set off a signal and wait. Eventually, eerie orange lights show up over the surrounding trees, and everyone believes that it is Paul's rescue ship. However, it is an army helicopter, with the Big Guy  on board. As she and three troops move to shoot Paul, Zoil arrives, and it is revealed that he was Paul's inside contact who helped him to escape. Zoil disarms the men, but is shot in the shoulder by the Big Guy. Tara punches out the Big Guy, but Moses appears with his shotgun and mortally wounds Graeme while aiming at Paul. Paul heals him and collapses, briefly appearing to be dead before he quickly recovers; Moses proclaims this to be a miracle from God.

As a boy, even though from a strict Plymouth Brethren family, he felt God told him through a sign to leave his father and his faith and join the Church of England. Lucinda Leplastrier  is a teenage Australian heiress who has an almost desperate desire to liberate her sex from the confines of the male-dominated culture of Australia at that time. She buys a glass factory and has a dream of building a church made almost entirely of glass, and then transporting it to the Australian Outback. Oscar and Lucinda meet on a ship going to Australia; once there, they are for different reasons ostracized from society, and as a result ""join forces"" together. Oscar and Lucinda are both passionate gamblers, and Lucinda bets Oscar her entire inheritance that he cannot transport the glass church to the Outback safely.

A down-on-his-luck illusionist  watches his popularity and employment in Paris dry up. He packs his meager belongings and props, including an ill-tempered white rabbit, and moves to London. There he finds himself as the irrelevant act following a popular rock band. Despite his wounded pride, he adopts a nothing-to-lose attitude and continues plying his trade at yet smaller gatherings in bars, cafés, and private parties. He accepts the invitation of a drunken party patron, taking a long, slow journey to a remote Scottish island . The small village's pub has only recently been wired for electricity, and he and his rabbit are appreciated for a time. Living modestly in a room above the pub, the illusionist encounters a young girl named Alice who is captivated by his otherworldly abilities and kind gestures, including a gift of new red shoes. Competition from more modern forms of entertainment follow the illusionist even to this idyll, and he soon moves on. Alice believes the downtrodden performer possesses genuine supernatural powers, and follows him to Edinburgh, where he performs at a modest, out-of-the-way theater. They book a room in a rundown guest house favored by other fading performers . The illusionist sleeps on a small couch and the girl keeps busy by cleaning and cooking food that she shares with the neighbors. The girl's affections even tame the rabbit, but the illusionist's increasingly meager wages, lavished on a series of gifts for Alice, lead him to pawn off his magic kit and secretly take on more demeaning jobs. The other traditional performers become similarly depressed and destitute. Unable to muster the courage to tell his starry-eyed admirer the truth about his fading trade, the illusionist continues giving until he has nothing more to offer. Alice meanwhile discovers the affection of a handsome young man, and once he sees them walking together, the illusionist opts to leave her with money and move on. His final message is a letter that says ""Magicians do not exist."" Alice subsequently moves in with her new boyfriend. The illusionist looks longingly at a photo throughout the film, though it is never revealed to the audience during the film. At the end of the film, a photo appears dedicating the film to author Tati's own daughter. During the final train trip, the illusionist looks at the photo for a last time, and his hand drops down where the photo can be vaguely seen, particularly in the Blu-ray release. It is apparently the same picture of Tati's daughter seen at the end of the film. Some people believe that his daughter went missing at a young age, and that Alice is his daughter.stage edinburgh, scotland disillusionment aftercreditsstinger magician",False,tt0775489,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6007194,1,0,-1.996407307638142,-2.2977368060284267,,,,,12175117.0,44750117.0,-6522324.0,7,1477676.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-6522324.0,1477676.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1477676.0,-6522324.0,2.3333333333333335,1.0,102557850.13709407

The detective concludes by telling the suspect that he will catch whomever else he is in league with; the detective is then called to take a phone call outside the room and is told that the man's daughter was just downstairs and that she left the hospital. While he is on the phone, a scream is heard, and the detective finds the nurse in shock. He looks at the window and spots the man, who jumped out of the window. The man leaves behind a note ""I'm sory [sic] Abby."" Two weeks earlier, Owen  is an unhappy and lonely 12-year-old boy who is neglected by his divorcing parents and continually harassed at school by bullies. One evening, when Owen is alone in the courtyard of his apartment complex, he is approached by Abby , a girl who has moved into the apartment next door. Abby tells Owen that they cannot be friends, but regardless, she and Owen grow closer and start communicating by Morse code through the walls of their apartments. At school, the main bully, Kenny , scars Owen with an antenna rod and beats him; when Abby finds out, she tells him to defend himself and she will help him if needed. Abby's caretaker, Thomas , occasionally goes out to kill local residents, revealing that Abby is a vampire and he does this to feed her. During his first murder, he accidentally spills the blood and returns home empty-handed; a furious Abby leaves, kills, and feeds on a jogger who lives in their neighborhood. One night, Thomas hides in the back of a high school student’s car in order to subdue him, but the student picks up a passenger, completely confounding Thomas's plans. While the driver stops at a gas station, Thomas subdues the passenger and tries to flee, but crashes the car in a nearby ditch and becomes trapped inside. Thomas douses his face with acid so that his connection to Abby will not be discovered. He is taken to the hospital, which leads into the opening scene; when Abby learns of this, she climbs up outside his window to see him. Thomas leans forward to offer his throat to Abby, who drinks his blood. Thomas passes out and falls to his death. As he continues to pursue the case, the detective gradually learns of Thomas' connection to Abby. The next day, on a school outing to a frozen pond, Kenny threatens to push Owen into an ice hole. Owen defends himself with a metal pole, splitting Kenny's ear. The body of the jogger Abby killed earlier is discovered under the ice, dumped there by Thomas. Later, Owen takes Abby to an abandoned area of their apartment complex, where he cuts his finger to make a blood pact with her. Abby is drawn to the blood; thirsty, she licks it up and Owen sees her vampiric form for the first time. Not wanting to attack Owen, Abby flees and instead attacks Virginia , a woman in the complex park. Owen then confronts Abby at her apartment, where she admits that she is a vampire, needing blood to live, and that she will die if exposed to sunlight. Owen also discovers that Thomas was not her father. Owen sees an aging photo booth photograph of Abby and a young boy, suggesting that she met Thomas when he was Owen's age, and that he stayed with her and took care of her. Horrified, Owen immediately leaves. Abby tries to block his way, but eventually lets him go. Meanwhile at the hospital, Virginia transforms into a vampire, but when a nurse draws the curtains, the daylight causes her to burst into flames, killing them both. Abby visits one night while Owen's mother  is away. Owen opens the door for her but she tells him that she needs him to invite her in. He asks her why, so she enters without an invitation. She immediately begins to bleed profusely through her skin. Owen panics and shouts that she can come in. She reveals that she might have died if he hadn't given permission, but that she knew he would relent. The next morning, the detective knocks on the door of Abby's apartment. He hears a small noise made by Owen and forces his way in. Owen hides, but the detective finds Abby asleep in the bathtub. When he removes the paper and cardboard covering the bathroom window, Abby's exposed leg begins to burn, awakening her. She attacks him. As she drains his blood, Owen looks on but decides to close the door rather than intervene. Abby tells Owen she will have to leave town, and he watches sadly as she enters a taxi with her few belongings. During an evening swim class, Kenny, his older brother Jimmy , and their friends create a diversion to get the coach out of the building, then they frighten the other students into leaving. They corner Owen and threaten him with a knife. Jimmy tells Owen that if he can hold his breath underwater for three minutes, he will merely cut Owen's cheek; if Owen cannot, he will poke out one of Owen's eyes. Owen stays underwater nearly to the limit of his breath, when a severed head falls through the water in front of him and the pool becomes clouded with blood. Owen comes up, gasping for air, as Abby slaughters the remaining bullies. Abby and Owen flee. Owen leaves town in broad daylight on a cross-country train. He is traveling with a large trunk. After the conductor leaves him, knocking inside the trunk taps out a message in Morse code. Owen knocks a response on the side of the trunk.vampire child vampire remake bully young boy biting dead boy hammer horror 1980s",False,tt1228987,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,24145613,0,0,0.20728065,-2.2977368060284267,84558.0,364937.0,,,,,,0,,,65071607.0,0.0,86571607.0,2.0,126720069.0,2.0,163720069.0,1.0,-10414058.0,1.0,335942.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20440422.769230768,64209653.538461536,13.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8720091.0,17220091.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,83542539.33333333,60459206.0,0.375,1.6666666666666667,102557850.13709407

Some 40 years later, he is pursued by ""David Manenbaum"" , a hitman who is under orders to kill Brossard and leave a printed 'Statement' on his body proclaiming the assassination was vengeance for the Jews executed in 1944. Brossard sees ""Manenbaum"" at a local bar, becomes concerned about possible trouble, and begins to run from him. Brossard kills ""Manenbaum"", then realizes he must now run from the law to save his life. Brossard hides ""Manenbaum's"" body and car, after robbing the dead body, finding the printed 'Statement', and discovering that his pursuer was travelling on a Canadian passport. Brossard spends the rest of the film running between short-term sanctuaries in southern France within the Traditional Catholic community, appealing to long-time allies who have operated in great secrecy to shield him and provide him with funds for years, but now bring increased scrutiny to themselves for continuing to do so. The murder of ""Manenbaum"" attracts the interest of local police, and eventually the persistent Investigating Judge Anne-Marie Levi . She becomes absorbed by the case, and is not discouraged by the lack of assistance she encounters from official sectors she believes should be helping her. Levy forms an alliance with the similarly dedicated Colonel Roux , a senior French Gendarmerie's investigator, and the pair initially suspect that ""Manenbaum"" was part of a Jewish assassination plot. The pair dig deeply into the case, and discover that Brossard has been the subject of several previous investigations, dating back more than 40 years, which have all failed. Just how has Brossard been able to escape justice for so long? Levi and Roux discover hidden resources and build up the pressure, tightening the noose around Brossard, who finds his allies increasingly reluctant to help him. Meanwhile, doubts begin to arise over the theory of a Jewish hit squad, but it is clear that someone wants Brossard dead, and the elimination of ""Manenbaum"" does not put an end to their efforts. Brossard in desperation secretly pays a surprise visit to his estranged wife Nicole , a maid who is living in lower-middle-class circumstances in Marseille and is very apprehensive about seeing him again. Brossard's allies, including certain priests and a wartime colleague, who has risen into a position of great power within the French government, are feeling the heat from the relentless questioning of Levy and Roux. As the story approaches its climax, Brossard, desperate and unsure whom to trust, seeks new identity papers and money, so he can escape France forever. He knows far too much for the safety of his protectors, and has relied upon this fact for years. But Brossard is now living on borrowed time, and it becomes a question of not only whether he can avoid capture and flee France, but also of which pursuer will find him first.",False,tt0340376,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1545064,0,0,-16.47500427166771,-14.415123713336484,16203256.42857143,23774685.0,,,-5732806.0,267194.0,10649527.25,39,21899527.25,4.0,50078436.5,3.0,73278436.5,2.0,19200989.333333332,4.0,38800989.333333336,3.0,-3869983.6666666665,41.0,867711.0,3.0,21345441.5,2.0,82745441.5,2.0,-38546877.0,15.0,8083123.0,1.0,20074978.0,6.0,33241644.666666668,3.0,35838061.0,18.0,65838061.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-12143288.0,2856712.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,-33326758.0,26673242.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,121165.0,15121165.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40594366.78125,14346321.614583334,16.0,2.5,79569518.43496008

The group loses the use of their rehearsal space, forcing them to try to raise money or practice in other locations. Eventually they secure a space in a ballet school, on the condition that they include five ballet dancers in their routine. At first, they struggle to get along, but they all become friends in the end. One of the teachers at the ballet school, Helena , takes Carly  to a ballet where she starts getting ideas for their routine. When she arrives home, Carly finds Jay waiting for her and the two spend the night together. During a dance battle in a club the next night, the team learn that Jay has betrayed the team by joining The Surge, a rival crew. Jay brags about his sex with Carly and Tomas , a ballet dancer, punches Jay out of anger. Jay is furious and swears revenge. Carly, upset over the betrayal, leaves the club and is nearly hit by a car before Tomas pulls her out of the way. Tomas then takes Carly back to his apartment where they dance on the roof, eventually kissing. Carly then leaves him alone on the roof, while they both look at the sunrise and smile. The next day at the school, Carly announces the new name of their dance crew: Breakin Point. Another teacher at the school, outraged that her students are being corrupted, deliberately plans a Royal Ballet audition for the same day as the street dance finals. The ballet dancers promise Carly they will make it, but the auditions were running overtime. In an attempt to give Breakin Point more time to wait for the ballet dancers, Carly's friend Eddie  goes out onto the dance floor and starts dancing, surprising the crew and wowing the audience. The ballet team turn up at the final anyway, and their teacher Helena drives the judges to the final so they can see the dancers perform.

The first shot shows a young man lying on an operating table smiling at a woman observing from the other side of the glass window. The woman is 28-year-old Kathy H , she narrates the movie and reminisces about her childhood at a boarding school called Hailsham House, as well as her adult life after leaving the school. The first act of the film depicts the young Kathy , along with her friends Tommy  and Ruth , spending their childhood at Hailsham in the late 1970s. The school seems to be somewhat unusual. Students are encouraged to create artwork such as paintings and poetry instead of science and maths normal for school children, and their best work gets into ""the Gallery."" There is also a strong emphasis on ""keeping yourselves healthy inside"" especially when it comes to smoking. At one point, a new teacher, Miss Lucy  quietly informs the students of their nature: they exist only as organ donors for transplants, and will die - or, rather, ""complete"" - in their early adulthood. The following day Miss Lucy is ""no longer working at Hailsham."" As time passes, Kathy and Tommy fall in love, but Tommy falls into a manipulative relationship with Ruth. Ruth and Tommy stay together throughout the rest of their time at Hailsham. In the second act of the film, the three friends, now young adults, are rehoused in cottages on a farm. They are permitted to leave the grounds if they wish but are resigned to their eventual fate, seeing it as inevitable. At the farm, they meet former pupils of schools similar to theirs, two of whom one day sight a woman in a nearby town who they believe to be a ""possible"" for Ruth, her ""original"" - the person she was cloned from. Ruth is ecstatic at the prospect, but when she, Kathy, Tommy, and the two witnesses travel to the coast to re-examine the woman, it turns out there is very little resemblance. Ruth, bitter and disillusioned, rages that all donors are ""modeled on trash"", meaning that they are cloned from the people lowest in society, or, in her words, ""in the gutter."" From the others, Kathy and her friends hear rumors of the possibility of ""deferral"" – a temporary reprieve from organ donation for donors who are in love and can somehow prove it. Tommy becomes convinced that the Gallery at Hailsham was intended to look into their souls and that artwork sent to the Gallery will be able to verify true love. Hoping to hear a declaration of love from him, she is visibly distressed when he reveals that his failure to send artwork to the Gallery as a child means he cannot apply with Ruth for a deferral. The relationship between Tommy and Ruth becomes sexual, putting a strain on Kathy's friendships with the two. Kathy, feeling the need to distance herself, leaves the cottages to become a ""carer"" – a clone who is given a temporary reprieve from donation to do the job of supporting and comforting donors as they give up their organs. Tommy and Ruth's relationship ends shortly before her departure, though it is not depicted but revealed through Kathy's narration. In the third and final act of the film, ten years later, Kathy is working as a carer. She has watched many clones gradually ""complete"" as their organs are harvested. Kathy has not seen Ruth or Tommy since the cottages. While working as a carer, Kathy happens to meet Ruth again, who is frail and unwell after two donations. They find Tommy, who is also weakened, and the three of them drive to the sea as a short trip at Ruth's request. There, Ruth asks for their forgiveness for keeping them apart. She admits she has always known that Kathy and Tommy were meant to be together because their love for each other was real, whereas Ruth was with Tommy because she was jealous of his closeness to Kathy and afraid to be ""left alone."" She tells them it was the worst thing she ever did and now she wants to put it right, then claims she has found a means to do so: she has found the address of the gallery owner, ""Madame"" from Hailsham, whom she thinks may grant deferrals to couples in love. With some reluctance due to skepticism, Kathy accepts the opportunity. Shortly afterward, Ruth dies on the operating table when her liver is extracted. Kathy and Tommy finally begin a relationship, sharing a passionate kiss after a night of Kathy's reading to him, before getting into bed together. Tommy explains to Kathy that he has been creating art in the hope that it will convince Madame to give them a deferral. He and Kathy drive to visit Madame, who lives with the headmistress of Hailsham. The two teachers sympathetically tell them that there have never been any such deferrals. They also explain that the purpose of the Gallery was not to look into their souls, but to determine if they had souls at all. Hailsham had been, in fact, the last remaining place to consider the ethical implications of the donor program. It had closed down owing to lack of funding. As Kathy and Tommy leave, it is strongly implied that Madame is Kathy's original. Kathy and Tommy take in the news and as they drive away, Tommy requests Kathy to stop the car to let him out and subsequently breaks down in an explosion of rage and frustration. Kathy consoles him, just as she had done during their days at Hailsham when Tommy would fall into fits of rage when bullied, and the two weep in each other's arms. The ending sequence of the movie returns to the first shot of the movie where Tommy is being anesthetized on the operating table for what would be his last organ donation, while looking and smiling at Kathy who is standing on the other side of the glass window. The film ends with Kathy still living, but knowing that her organ donations will begin in one month. She has come to an acceptance of her fate. Contemplating the ruins of her childhood, her voice-over ponders whether her fate is any different from the people who will receive her organs; after all, ""we all complete.""based on novel or book sadness forgiveness dystopia boarding school cloning existentialism",False,tt1334260,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,9455232,1,0,-0.5864232628030703,-2.2977368060284267,57555092.0,68977331.8888889,57115388.571428575,76401102.85714285,52573197.85714286,64730340.71428572,18596852.0,1,26096852.0,1.0,34352607.0,1.0,64352607.0,1.0,49655200.71428572,8.0,85265904.71428572,7.0,,0.0,,,7644196.0,0.0,15644196.0,1.0,2384213.5555555555,9.0,38532310.11111111,9.0,2786409.3333333335,8.0,11453076.0,6.0,,0.0,,,55097721.5,98977606.0,2.0,48380201.666666664,79300124.66666667,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-5900665.5,14849334.5,2.0,,,,14664776.833333334,34894776.833333336,6.0,45104816.2,67904816.2,5.0,,,,18596852.0,26096852.0,1.0,112799408.25,131299408.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,29868844.0,57368844.0,2.0,,,,137101246.33333334,154101246.33333334,3.0,,,,99419556.2,124419556.2,5.0,,,,,,,49238440.0,64238440.0,1.0,179393733.16666666,248393733.16666666,6.0,,,40224157.637566134,19236579.76719577,3.375,4.166666666666667,102557850.13709407

They are called to England by a potential client, sight unseen. At first they hesitate since both are already booked to do work for someone in Los Angeles, only a few days post. Suddenly they get a phone call that their local customer has had a fatal accident, which seems awfully coincidental to Pete. Nonetheless, he tags along with Maggie to work for their latest client, who has prepaid Maggie's airfare. Arriving in England, Maggie and Pete get into a country road accident, one that involves their motorcycle and a vintage limousine belonging to Jason Mountolive , a moribund and reclusive multi-millionaire . Apologizing for their unfortunate mishap, this independently wealthy Englishman invites the twosome to stay at Ravenhurst: his rambling country estate. But this is no setback; it was Jason himself who arranged Maggie's trip here, ostensibly to do interior decorations for Ravenhurst.  Once installed at Ravenhurst, Maggie and Pete get acquainted with Jason's five  beneficiaries, including ""...a million-dollar prostitute, a star-maker, a nation-killer, a woman whose lust runs cold as graveyard snow..."" In other words, various European luminaries who are ""beholden"" to Jason for helping them with their careers... and with occasional run-ins, public scandals, et al. All five have been summoned to Ravenhurst in a fashion much like Maggie's, because Jason is about to die; in fact, he is wasting away upstairs as they speak. Maggie is astonished to hear this; Jason seemed vigorous, almost youthful, when she and Pete first met him.  Jason receives visits from those who have come to see him; indeed, their benefactor lies dying in a sterilized chrome-and-glass-styled bedroom which is equipped with various life-support machines. He calls Maggie to his bed, which is shrouded by white curtains so she cannot see Jason's face. Then his hand, which suggests that of a monster, abruptly reaches out and puts a ring on her finger, a ring emblazoned with the Mountolive family crest. After Jason dismisses her, Maggie rejoins the other five guests, who all wear like rings. She tries to remove the ring, but it has grafted itself to her finger. Shortly thereafter, the European guests proceed to die via increasingly mysterious and gruesome means. Maria, despite being an excellent swimmer, somehow becomes trapped under the surface of Jason's indoor pool and is drowned. Recording-studio executive Clive Jackson  gets a chicken bone lodged in his throat during dinner and perishes during a botched tracheotomy, although he was having ham and pate but no chicken. Karl Liebnecht , a German military-surplus dealer, is cremated by a massive tongue of flame which spews dragonlike from Ravenhurst's fireplace yet leaves the rest of the room he is in untouched. A mirror in Barbara's bedroom explodes, impaling her with glass shards like a pincushion, then reforms itself without a crack. Jacques, a hotelier, tries to kill Maggie and Pete because he suspects them of engineering these inexplicable deaths. Just as he gets the drop on them, his shotgun jams and backfires into his face, blowing him off Ravenhurst's roof. Amid these bizarre tragedies, Maggie and Pete discover - via newspaper clippings - that their fellow guests were each accused of murder, public-property destruction, or worse... yet never paid for their respective crimes. Maggie also discovers that Jason's mother was Lady Margaret Walsingham, while his father was the Lord of Mountolive; both their families were heavily into black magic and witchcraft. Lady Margaret and her husband were burned at the stake for heresy, although their son survived. Maggie realizes that she is Jason's great-granddaughter, and has been lured to England accordingly, albeit under false pretenses. Maggie is now the last remaining ""seal-bearer,"" the heir to Jason's ""Legacy"" : ostensibly the Walsingham-Mountolive financial empire, which the other five  beneficiaries ran for him; but also the sinister powers which he used to sacrifice them to the Devil. She returns upstairs to Jason's room. With his strength and breath running out, Jason confirms that he was responsible for killing all the other guests. He prepares to pass his Satanic abilities and knowledge on to her, with instructions to choose six heirs of her own; when the proper time comes, Maggie will bring about the deaths of all except one who will inherit the powers of Satan. Pete forces his way into the room and attempts to halt said ceremony by short-circuiting Jason's life-support system. But Maggie and the Legacy have already claimed each other; she is now Lady Margaret, with the entire household staff of Ravenhurst at her beck and call.  Maggie selects Pete as her first beneficiary, or ""seal-bearer."" She gives him a Ravenhurst crest-ring which, sure enough, grafts itself to his finger and the cycle begins anew.cat broken mirror",False,tt0079450,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,11364985,0,0,3.5459940000000003,15.1328345263288,3800000.0,7300000.0,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,29251525.0,3.0,34251525.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,56700000.0,10.0,68700000.0,1.0,108819547.0,7.0,116019547.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,39672692.5,49972692.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,84558.0,364937.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,72990357.33333333,64923690.666666664,2.5,1.0,68011965.11413558

An explosion flips one of the vehicles, and flashes of gunfire show U.S. soldiers firing at an enormous tentacled creature. The alien's features are similar to that of an octopus, yet it strides upon several hard, insect-like legs. In the background, a radio transmission from one of the soldiers obtains approval for a dangerously close air strike. Meanwhile, a civilian with the troops screams for help and attempts to drag the seemingly lifeless body of a woman off the road and away from the creature. The soldiers withdraw as the man is left behind, lifting the woman and trying to carry her away. Moments later, an air-to-ground missile homes in on the creature. The scene changes to Andrew Kaulder , a young American photojournalist, who is instructed by his wealthy employer to get the latter's daughter Samantha Wynden  back to the United States from San José, Central America. Andrew has no interest in being an escort but is pressured into doing so. He locates Samantha in a Mexican hospital. She is being treated for an injured wrist and seems at odds with her impending marriage to her fiancé. After leaving the hospital, the pair board a train to reach the Mexican coast, where they plan to take a ferry to the United States. However, the pair are temporarily slowed down by the destruction of the railroad. They learn that if they do not leave the country within a few days, sea and air travel will be blocked, and they will have to wait six months before safe travel is possible. With that deadline looming, Andrew makes the decision to walk the rest of the way to the Coast and Samantha reluctantly complies. After spending the night with a generous local family, the pair make their way to the eastern gulf coast of Mexico. Arriving at the port, they learn that the last ferry will leave the next morning at 7 o'clock. Andrew is forced to buy Samantha a single ticket costing an exorbitant price of 5,000, from a dishonest ticket agent. That night, they explore the town's night-life: drinking, eating and having a good time together, but upon returning to the hotel, it soon becomes obvious Samantha wants to go to bed alone. Andrew resumes drinking heavily throughout the night after she turns him away from her room. The next morning Samantha discovers Andrew in bed with a local girl he had picked up. Shocked, she leaves the room and Andrew follows, giving the girl the opportunity to steal their passports. This means that Samantha is not able to board the ferry. Given no other option to return home, Samantha returns to the agent and barters her engagement ring for 10,000 in exchange for an escort for Andrew and her through the infected zone. Their journey takes them across the Mexican quarantine zone. Initially they travel by riverboat, where they hear and partially see the alien creatures along the way. Eventually, they are dropped off and transferred to a group of armed escorts who are to lead them overland to the US-Mexico border. While they are traveling in a convoy, it is attacked by the large aliens. As the tentacled creatures begin to demolish the other vehicles in the convoy, the escorts guarding Andrew and Samantha abandon them to try and gun down the attacking aliens. The sounds of battle soon come to an end, and Andrew and Samantha are forced to hide in silence as the creatures surround and inspect the remaining vehicles. After Andrew shuts off the light in their van, the nearby aliens ignore them. They instead destroy the remaining truck that had its headlights still on, indicating that light is of importance in some way to the aliens. When morning comes, it is evident that none of the guards has survived the ordeal, their bloodied bodies strewn across the jungle. One of the corpses is that of a female child. On finding the girl he removes two camera lenses from his bag and then pulls out a coat from deeper in the bag which he uses to cover the girl and onto which he places a yellow flower picked from the jungle. He sorrowfully documents what he sees. There is nothing in this scene which shows him taking any photographs, thereby emphasizing how his view of the matter has changed since his earlier cynical comment that a photo of a dead girl would be worth 50,000. He gingerly salvages a pair of gas masks from two of the bodies before returning to Samantha. They make a day's worth of progress before they spend the night at the top of what appears to be an Aztec pyramid with the US border wall visible on the horizon. The next day, they arrive at the checkpoint nestled in a gap in the massive wall, but it appears to be unmanned. As they cross the abandoned checkpoint and explore a nearby suburban ghost town, Andrew and Samantha realize the American border has been evacuated and the aliens have advanced into the United States. After walking along an evacuation route, the two stumble across an abandoned gas station. Andrew calls the police and is informed they will be picked up. Andrew and Samantha phone their respective families. Andrew speaks with his son, becoming visibly emotional as he does so. As they finish their calls, a lone creature silently approaches the gas station from behind. Andrew fails to notice it as he lies on the concrete of the pumping station. It sends its tentacles into the store, setting off the typical door-chime. Samantha, thinking it is Andrew coming inside to join her, looks up smiling but quickly begins to scoot away across the floor, horrified. She hides behind a set of shelves as two tentacles explore the inside of the store, getting dangerously close to her several times. They soon turn their attention to a TV that is displaying the news, pressing the tips of the appendages against the screen as pulses of light run up their lengths. Realizing their attraction to the electrically-produced light, Samantha quickly unplugs the TV and the creature loses interest in the store. The creature strides to the road beside the gas station as Samantha leaves the store to join Andrew. They both watch in amazement as a second alien appears and begins communicating with the first. Their communication appears to be more than simply vocal, as their tentacles interlace and pulse with light rhythmically. In this rare spectacle, the giant creatures no longer seem monstrous killers, but instead appear as gentle giants sharing a tender, beautiful moment. However, as quickly as they came, the creatures part ways, leaving Samantha and Andrew alone together as they wait for the military to arrive. As the convoy approaches the gas station, one of the soldiers hums Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"", implying that the opening scene of the film has already shown what will happen to Andrew and Samantha after they are picked up. Watching the creatures vanish into the night, Samantha tearfully declares, ""I don't want to go home"" and they share a brief kiss before they are interrupted by the military rescue convoy.monster pyramid radio dystopia infection forest low-budget alien alien invasion central america cattle dead fish",False,tt1470827,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,5639730,1,0,10.27946,-2.2977368060284267,7200821.0,10202371.0,,,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12370930.0,18144030.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,102557850.13709407

The film observes them over the course of the four seasons of a year, surrounded by family and friends who mostly suffer some degree of unhappiness. Gerri's friend and colleague, Mary, works as a receptionist at the health centre. She is a middle-aged divorcee seeking a new relationship, and despite telling everyone she is happy, appears desperate and depressed. She often seems to drink too much. The Hepples' only child, Joe, is 30 and unmarried and works as a solicitor giving advice on housing. In the summer the Hepples are visited by Ken, Tom's old friend from his student days. Ken is overweight, eats, smokes and drinks compulsively and seems very unhappy. Tom and Gerri host a barbecue in Ken's honour. Mary drives her newly bought car to the party, but gets lost and arrives late. Having had some wine, she flirts with Joe, whom she has known since he was a child. He remains friendly but does not reciprocate the flirtation. After the party, Mary reluctantly gives Ken a lift to the train station. He makes a clumsy romantic advance and Mary irritably rejects him. Months later, in the autumn, Mary is once again at Tom and Gerri's home. Joe arrives with a new girlfriend, Katie. Mary appears rude and hostile towards Katie, which is not appreciated by Tom and Gerri. This creates a rift between Gerri and Mary. In the winter Tom, Gerri, and Joe attend the funeral for the wife of Tom's brother, Ronnie. Towards the end of the service, Ronnie's estranged son, Carl, arrives, and angrily asks why the ceremony was not delayed for him. At the reception at Ronnie's house, Carl becomes aggressive and walks out. Tom and Gerri invite Ronnie back to London to stay with them for a while and Ronnie agrees. While Tom and Gerri are at their garden allotment Mary arrives unannounced at their home and persuades Ronnie to let her in. Her car has just been written off and she is upset. The two have a cup of tea and a desultory chat before Mary takes a nap on the couch. When Tom and Gerri return they are unhappy to find Mary at their house. Gerri explains to Mary that she feels let down by her earlier behaviour towards Katie. Mary apologises and weeps. Gerri gradually extends a degree of warmth to Mary, suggesting that she should seek professional help and inviting her to stay for dinner, and the two women set the table. Joe and Katie arrive, their relationship still appearing strong and happy. The Hepples enjoy dinner together. Mary eats with them but appears lost and uncertain.jealousy cooking garden funeral season loneliness unrequited love red wine",False,tt1431181,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,18124262,1,0,1.26553275,-2.2977368060284267,50773.5,6800773.5,45308452.125,57820952.125,,,114529244.3125,18,165204590.4375,16.0,-3257872.5,8.0,6742127.5,2.0,50773.5,14.0,6800773.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,3029747.0,1.0,10329747.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,33810618.25,68560618.25,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,800515.6666666666,8967182.333333334,3.0,-3257872.5,6742127.5,2.0,72410461.8888889,86132684.1111111,9.0,11777699.0,31260556.14285714,7.0,,,,,,,47201402.5,54951402.5,6.0,34172267.428571425,51472267.428571425,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-6595000.0,405000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-186727.0,6938273.0,4.0,,,,563261.5,8063261.5,2.0,,,47269309.609375,28587973.078125,5.125,5.25,102557850.13709407

The next morning he rides through the park on his mountain bike, aiming to cut 45 minutes off the guide book's estimate for the time needed to reach his destination. He is on foot, running along a bare rock formation when he sees two hikers, Kristi  and Megan , apparently lost. Ralston convinces the pair that he is a trail guide and offers to show them a much more interesting route than the one they had been trying to find. He leads them through Robbers Roost area narrow canyons, including a blind jump into an underground pool, where the three film themselves repeating the plunge using Ralston's video camera. As they part company, Kristi and Megan invite Ralston to a party they're holding the next night, and he promises to attend. However, they doubt he will show. Ralston continues into Blue John Canyon, through a narrow passage where boulders are suspended, wedged between the walls of rock. As he descends, one boulder is jarred loose, falling after Ralston to the bottom of the canyon and pinning his right arm against the canyon wall, trapping him. He initially yells for help, but the extreme isolation of his location means that nobody is within earshot. As he resigns himself to the fact that he is on his own, he begins recording a video diary on his camera and using his pocket multi-tool to attempt to chip away at the boulder. He also begins rationing his water and food. As he realizes his efforts to chip away at the boulder are futile, he begins to attempt to cut into his arm, but finds his knife too blunt to break his skin. He then stabs his arm, but realizes he will not be able to cut through the bone. He finds himself out of water and is forced to drink his own urine. His video logs become more and more desperate as he feels himself dying. He begins dreaming about relationships and past experiences, including a former lover , family (Lizzy Caplan, Treat Williams, [[Kate Burton , and the two hikers he met before his accident. After reflecting upon his life, he comes to the realization that everything he has done has led him to this ordeal, and that he was destined to die alone in the canyon. After five days, Ralston sees his unborn son through a premonition. He gathers the will to apply enough force to his forearm to break it and eventually severs his arm with the dull knife, fashioning a crude tourniquet out of the insulation for his CamelBak tube and using a carabiner to tighten it. He wraps the stump of his arm and takes a picture of the boulder that trapped him as he leaves it behind. He then makes his way out of the canyon, where he is forced to rappel down a 65 ft rockface and hike several miles before, exhausted and covered in blood, he finally runs into a family on a day hike. The family sends for help and Ralston is evacuated by a Utah Highway Patrol helicopter. The film ends with shots of the real Aron Ralston from his life after his ordeal — including several of Ralston's further adventures in climbing and mountaineering, which he continued following the accident — and of Ralston with his wife, whom he met three years later, and their son, Leo, born in 2010. A title card that appears before the closing credits says that Ralston now always leaves a note whenever he goes anywhere alone.mountain despair utah alone canyon climbing based on a true story flashback rescue survival escape true trapped boulder adventurer climber isolated hikers very little dialogue",False,tt1542344,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,35692920,0,0,0.9829399999999999,-2.2977368060284267,51245106.0,63025121.9,179834564.0,224834564.0,,,-22582567.5,4,22917432.5,2.0,-9073590.0,2.0,5926410.0,1.0,,0.0,,,19533783.0,2.0,34533783.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,49091931.5,99591931.5,2.0,130382702.33333333,154716035.66666666,3.0,87835328.83333333,115168662.16666667,6.0,,,,122744888.0,130844888.0,3.0,125805221.0,154430221.0,8.0,107839237.0,130639237.0,5.0,,,,146404396.0,212404396.0,1.0,11777699.0,31260556.14285714,7.0,,,,,,,36690621.25,58815621.25,4.0,130130890.33333333,158464223.66666666,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,194228550.0,210608434.5,2.0,78043431.83333333,87743431.83333333,6.0,,,,,,,,,21125875.166666668,-4040791.5,1.0,1.3333333333333333,102557850.13709407

Previously, he was raised by his widowed father, a museum worker . His father had died in a museum fire, but prior to that, he had doted on Hugo, taking him to movies and showing him how he was repairing a mechanical man automaton that supposedly could write a message. Following his father's death, Hugo was taken by his alcoholic uncle Claude  who showed little sentiment for Hugo but taught the boy how to maintain the clocks at the station. When Claude disappears, Hugo continues to maintain the clocks while seeking out a living by stealing food and supplies, fearing that if the vigilant Station Inspector  were to discover Hugo, he would be turned over to an orphanage. Hugo continues the work on the automaton from his father's notebook, stealing what supplies he can from the passengers and storeclerks in the station. One day, he is caught by a bitter toymaker, Papa Georges . Georges confiscates Hugo's father's notebook, and Hugo is forced to trail Georges to his home to retrieve it. There, he meets Georges' goddaughter, Isabelle , who promises to help. The next day, Georges gives some ashes to Hugo, referring them as remains of the notebook but Isabelle tells him that it was not burnt. Finally, Georges lets Hugo earn his notebook back if he works for him every day to pay for all the items Hugo stole. During his free time, Hugo continues to work on the automaton. When it is finished, however, it is still missing one part; a heart-shaped key that goes into the back of the automaton to make it work. As the two grow close together, Hugo takes Isabelle to the movies, something that Georges would never let her do, while she introduces him to a bookstore owner  who has loaned her books in the past.  Hugo eventually takes Isabelle to see the automaton. Hugo is surprised to find that Isabelle wears that key as a necklace as a gift from Georges. They start up the automaton, and watch as it draws out an iconic scene from the film Voyage to the Moon by the film pioneer Georges Méliès. When the automaton writes a signature, Isabelle recognizes the handwriting as her godfather's own. They take the drawing to Georges' home for an explanation. They ask Isabelle's godmother Mama Jeanne  but she will not tell them anything. As Georges arrives home, Jeanne forces the children into a back room, where they find a hidden compartment in an armoire with many more drawings of Méliès' films. The noise draws Georges in, and he throws Hugo out, feeling betrayed. Some time later, Hugo and Isabelle discuss Méliès with the bookstore owner; he directs them to a book on the history of film. As they read the book, its author, Rene Tabard , appears and shares his common love for Méliès's work; though his book claims that Méliès died during World War I, but the two convince Tabard that the filmmaker is still alive. Tabard reveals he has the last known copy of Voyage, and Hugo suggests that they go to the Georges' house to watch it the next evening. That night, Hugo has a dream where he finds the heart-shaped key but is run over by an approaching train and ends with the sequence of the Gare Montparnasse accident. The next evening, Jeanne is hesitant about letting them show the film until Tabard recognizes her as Jeanne d'Alcy, a frequent and beautiful actress in many of Méliès' films. When the film finishes, Georges comes out, and emotionally reveals himself to be Méliès, recalling his filmmaking career. He transformed his illusionist skills into the special effects he used for his movies to bring his vivid imagination to life. However, with the onset of World War I, his films lost popularity with a war-weary population, and he became ruined, selling the films to be melted down to chemicals and quietly disappeared as a toy maker to sustain himself and Jeanne. Georges is despondent, believing all of his former film materials were otherwise destroyed in a museum fire, leading Hugo to recall the automaton. Hugo races back to the station to get the automaton , but before he can retrieve it, he is discovered by the Station Inspector and reveals that Claude's body had been discovered in the River Seine, and the Inspector now knows Hugo is an orphan. During the chase, Hugo climbs up the clock tower and is forced to climb onto the clock hands to hide from the Inspector. When he goes away, Hugo quickly climbs back in and gets the automaton but is quickly cornered again by the Inspector and the automaton is thrown onto the railway tracks. Despite the approach of an oncoming train, Hugo jumps onto the tracks to recover the automaton. With no time to climb back up onto the platform to save himself and the automaton, Hugo appears to face certain death from the oncoming train. However, the Inspector saves Hugo at the last moment. As the Inspector decides whether or not to arrest Hugo, Georges arrives and asserts that Hugo is now in his care. Hugo presents the automaton to Georges. Sometime later, a film festival is held showcasing over eighty recovered and restored Méliès films. Georges tearfully takes the stage, and thanks Hugo for his dedication and to the other attendees for sharing his imagination with him. After the festival, in the Georges' house, Hugo has acclimated as Georges' son, while Isabelle begins writing a book on the recent events. The film ends on a shot of the automaton sitting in a room.library based on novel or book movie business clock museum key toy orphan robot automaton hiding filmmaking leg brace doberman railway station 3d based on young adult novel",False,tt0970179,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,185770160,1,0,0.09276564705882354,1.026708649479613,-587844.8421052631,57675313.05263158,,,-9525220.666666666,37141446.0,23011066.666666668,4,40177733.333333336,3.0,44762942.333333336,1.0,65762942.333333336,3.0,-12155851.714285715,29.0,25744148.285714287,7.0,115295317.75,9.0,144545317.75,4.0,13404070.4,10.0,59664070.4,5.0,15090632.75,8.0,26015632.75,4.0,8007543.5,45.0,17720940.0,6.0,108384128.0,5.0,123384128.0,1.0,8534324.0,41784324.0,2.0,10430358.833333334,44847025.5,6.0,45868327.0,71868327.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,15173879.0,16173879.0,1.0,,,,557841637.0,609841637.0,1.0,,,,,,,178731369.0,278731369.0,1.0,,,,32891870.3,53762424.1,10.0,,,,,,,-11044402.0,38955598.0,1.0,102000000.0,152000000.0,1.0,-4214688.0,48785312.0,2.0,52488877.333333336,111032210.66666667,3.0,9715542.666666666,89715542.66666667,3.0,98006754.5,162506754.5,2.0,,,,34896772.25,46521772.25,4.0,,,,241773032.0,340398032.0,8.0,,,62876864.10654762,39474981.21071429,13.875,4.125,83145037.44008958

It is now 1867, and we see that Dillon has a vault filled with gold and a town of his own, named Kingdom Come. Dillon owns nearly every business of consequence in the town; if someone digs for gold, rents a hotel room, opens a bank account, or commits a crime, they will have to deal with Dillon. One of the few profitable enterprises in town that Dillon does not own is the saloon/brothel, which is operated by Lucia, his Portuguese lover. Donald Dalglish is a surveyor with the Central Pacific Railroad, which wants to put a train either through Kingdom Come, or somewhere in the vicinity. He is here to decide the route. Dillon is anxious to ensure that the railway line is routed through ""his"" town, as this will bring more business. Among the travelers who arrive in town with Dalglish are two women, the beautiful but ailing Elena Burn and her lovely teenage daughter Hope. The presence of these women is deeply troubling for Dillon, for they are the keys to a dark secret Dillon has kept from the people of Kingdom Come for nearly twenty years. Dillon had come to these mountains with his Polish wife Elena and their months old baby, Hope. On a cold and snowy night they happen upon a shack named Kingdom Come, owned by a disillusioned '49er named Burn. Similar to Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge, Dillon sells Elena and Hope to the prospector in exchange for the small gold claim  that would later flourish and make Dillon so wealthy. Burn has died, and Elena has come to find Dillon because Burn left her with nothing, she is dying, and she wants Dillon to give her 200 per year so that she can ""do right by Hope"".  Dillon tells Lucia that they have to end it and gives her some gold bricks and the deeds to her home, the saloon/brothel, and the tobacco house. Lucia is heartbroken, wanting Dillon and not his money. Dillon asks Elena to marry him , revealing that he never married anyone else because he was always married to her. Their time after the marriage is short, filled with Dillon's efforts to find a cure for her illness and ending with her death. Elena's death coincides with the decision to route the railway some distance from the town for easier passage and construction. Lucia moves the girls, the booze and the tobacco house to the valley, effectively moving the entire population of Kingdom Come to her new town of Lisboa, named for her father's home in Portugal, to be near the railroad. Following Elena's funeral, Hope tells Dillon that she is leaving to find Dalglish and start a life with him. Dillon takes her up to the original shack Kingdom Come, showing her a picture of their family when she was a baby, and revealing the deal made right on that spot between him and Burn. Hope leaves him and goes to the new Lisboa. Dillon is thus faced with the loss of Elena, Hope and his town. He sets fire to all the buildings in Kingdom Come. The smoke attracts the people of Lisboa, who find Dillon's frozen body in the snow near his original shack. Lucia is devastated, crying over the frozen body as it is brought back to the ruins of Kingdom Come. While many of the 'former' townspeople rush to find Dillon's stockpile of gold in the burned out vault, Hope and Dalglish choose instead to follow Dillon's body as Lucia and others continue with it down the mountain.",False,tt0218378,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1375635,0,0,-8.450181189050875,-1.1627692044360227,-6595000.0,405000.0,-4835596.0,5164404.0,-12586510.0,2413490.0,12491080.0,4,16491080.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-9854515.0,16.0,2561139.6666666665,3.0,-38546877.0,12.0,8083123.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-6595000.0,405000.0,1.0,,,,61332373.5,78832373.5,2.0,,,,-6595000.0,405000.0,1.0,,,,-6595000.0,405000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9045114.222222222,-11970104.0,4.0,1.6666666666666667,76394553.2193505

They all meet one other at a Diner, where they also see Dillon  and Smoothy  getting chased by the police while drug-dealing. As Dillon is running past, he drops a stolen diamond  in Cassandra's bag. He is unaware that Shannon has a big crush on Dillon as he always ignores her. The four then walk out and go home. Firstly, the story focuses upon Shannon: as she walks into her home, she sees that her mother has left for good and her dad is sitting in the living room all alone. She loses her temper, gets a packet of ""Pringles"", two cans of spray-paint and runs away. She then runs over to Joanne's home, who has to rush to work, telling her she does not have time to talk. Later on, she is called over to Jo's work place by Jo; where she is told to leave. When she refuses, Dillon kisses Jo upsetting Shannon, so she grabs a Pringles box from the shop and runs. She is taken in by a woman who saved her from getting raped, but Shannon seems to find that the woman is looking for the Pringles box. This is later confirmed when she finds out that she is searching for ""15 diamonds"". One is already in Cassandra's bag, whilst the rest are in the Pringles can which had fallen out of Shannon's bag earlier. She escapes by knocking the woman out with the bathroom door. She finds the diamonds by going back to the bench where she was almost attacked. Her story ends with her holding the diamonds above a bridge, suggesting she is about to jump and commit suicide. Secondly, the story moves onto Cassandra, who visits New York to meet up with a man called ""Brett"" she has met on the internet. The meeting ends with her having sex with him. She suddenly feels light headed and falls asleep, and in the morning uses an epipen to pull herself together. She discovers all her possessions gone except for her handbag containing a diamond. She also finds the letter that Shannon has been looking for, which was written by her mother. She later goes to ""Brett's"" house to later find that ""Brett"" is a stalker who hacks into Cassandra's computer taking videos of her. When the fake Brett comes, she knocks him out but later escapes chasing her down the street where she is rescued by a black woman who does not take kindly to racist stereotypical views. She gets her cousins to beat and tattoo the fake Brett with the words chosen by Cassandra. She forces her way into an audition for a new tutor and gets it before then leaving for London. Thirdly the story of Kerrys is explored. Kerrys and her girlfriend break into Cassandra's beachhouse and stay there. Her brother upon discovering them inside, locks them in the panic room and throws a party. While, Dillon and Smoothy visit his house, they ask him to keep the diamonds, now only 14 left, at his house. When the two girls escape from the panic room, they lock her brother in there and run away. Fourthly, Jo, who works at a 24-hour supermarket with Angelo  finds that her new manager ""Tee""  is in town. Tee has been working with Dillon and Smoothy to deliver the diamonds, but one is missing. Tee asks Dillon and Smoothy to come over to the supermarket; Dillon and Smoothy open the safe with the key, which Tee had given to them earlier, they remove the money and drop off the diamonds, which are 14, but Tee thinks there is 15. Dillon and Smoothy come to get the money, when they find Tee has betrayed them, and they rob the store and leave Tee with the 14 diamonds. Tee, however has hidden them in a Pringles box, which is then seen in flashback to show that the box is the very same one that Shannon has. Whilst Tee is about to be shot by the same woman who rescued Shannon earlier, Jo rescues him, but when he tries to run, Angelo attacks him. He is arrested by the police for illegal selling. Cassandra returns with the last diamond and the letter; the three, Cassandra, Jo, and Kerrys, then go to meet Shannon. They put the fourteen diamonds together and give it into the police and fly to New York. Whilst on the plane it is revealed that the same mysterious woman who had rescued Shannon is on the plane.",False,tt1514041,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1163967,0,0,-2.9520020756602205,-2.2977368060284267,,,,,,,1972336.0,2,21972336.0,1.0,-829000.0,4.0,165000.0,1.0,,0.0,,,18395702.0,5.0,18564702.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,7180804.5,8.0,52180804.5,2.0,18400000.0,27.0,30400000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24656568.5,9023968.5,5.75,1.2,102557850.13709407

The Duke has given up hope of a cure, but his wife Elizabeth  persuades him to see Lionel Logue , an Australian speech therapist in London. During their first session, Logue breaches royal etiquette and insists on calling his patient ""Bertie,"" a name used only within the Duke's family. When Albert decides Logue's methods and manner are unsuitable, the Australian bets a shilling that the Duke can recite Hamlet's ""To be, or not to be"" soliloquy without trouble while listening to The Marriage of Figaro played out loud on headphones. Logue records his performance on a gramophone record; convinced he has stammered throughout, Albert leaves in a huff, declaring his condition ""hopeless"" and dismissing Logue. Logue offers him the recording as a keepsake.  After King George&nbsp;V  makes his 1934 Christmas radio address, he explains to Albert the importance of broadcasting to a modern monarchy. He declares that ""David"" , Albert's older brother, will bring ruin to himself, the family, and the country when he accedes to the throne, leaving Chancellor Hitler and Premier Stalin to sort out matters in Europe. King George demands that Albert train himself, starting with a reading of his father's speech. He makes an agonising attempt to do so. Later, Albert plays Logue's recording and hears himself unhesitatingly reciting Shakespeare. He returns to Logue, but he and his wife insist that Logue stop delving into his private life and merely work on the physical aspects. Logue teaches his patient muscle relaxation and breath control techniques, but continues to gently probe at the psychological roots of the stutter. The Duke eventually reveals some of the pressures of his childhood: his strict father, the repression of his natural left-handedness, painful childhood metal splints to correct his knock-knees, his first nanny, who secretly mistreated him, and the early death of his epileptic younger brother, John. The two men become friends. In January 1936, George&nbsp;V dies, and David ascends the throne as King Edward&nbsp;VIII, but causes a monumental crisis with his determination to marry Mrs Wallis Simpson , an American socialite and twice a divorcée. At Christmas in Balmoral Castle, Albert points out that Edward, as head of the Church of England, cannot marry a divorced woman; Edward accuses his brother of wanting to usurp his place, calling his elocution lessons preparation, and resurrects his childhood taunt of ""B-B-B-Bertie"".  At his next session, Albert expresses his frustration that his speech has improved while talking to most people—except his own brother. Albert reveals the extent of Edward VIII's folly with Mrs Simpson. When Logue insists that Albert could be a good king instead of his brother, the latter labels such a suggestion as treason, mocks Logue's failed acting aspirations and humble origins, and dismisses him. When King Edward&nbsp;VIII abdicates to marry Mrs Simpson, Albert becomes King George&nbsp;VI. The new King and Queen visit Logue at his home to apologise, startling Logue's wife . During preparations for his coronation in Westminster Abbey, George VI learns that Logue has no formal qualifications. Logue explains that, as an elocution teacher, he was asked to help shell-shocked Australian soldiers returning from the First World War, and thereby found his calling. When George VI remains convinced of his unfitness to be king, Logue sits in King Edward's Chair and dismisses the underlying Stone of Scone as a trifle. Goaded by Logue's seeming disrespect, the King surprises himself with his own sudden outraged eloquence. Upon the declaration of war with Nazi Germany in September 1939, George&nbsp;VI summons Logue to Buckingham Palace to prepare for his upcoming radio address to millions of listeners in Britain and the Empire. The King is left alone with Logue in the room with the microphone. He delivers his speech competently, as if to Logue alone, who guides him silently throughout. Afterwards, the King and his family step onto the balcony of the palace to be viewed and applauded by the thousands who have gathered. A title card explains that Logue was always present at King George&nbsp;VI's speeches during the war, and that they remained friends for the rest of their lives.great britain radio monarchy stutter palace radio transmission royal family speech marriage based on a true story royalty death of father 1930s george vi winston churchill corgi",False,tt1504320,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,414211549,1,0,26.61410326666667,-2.2977368060284267,3104263.0,52437596.333333336,231122.8125,13161122.8125,0.0,20000.0,162601271.72727272,21,192783089.9090909,11.0,92372077.66666667,12.0,123538744.33333333,3.0,172057181.66666666,25.0,253884959.44444445,9.0,-7709130.5,11.0,19415869.5,4.0,24894887.777777776,20.0,45217110.0,9.0,285669538.8,9.0,366569538.8,10.0,-14886267.0,8.0,10113733.0,1.0,205249254.25,21.0,244749254.25,4.0,40528744.0,75195410.66666667,3.0,54680885.833333336,103847552.5,6.0,,,,,,,62406308.5,86286193.0,2.0,,,,-2200126.0,4199874.0,1.0,42027970.0,48027970.0,1.0,31560326.0,45122826.0,8.0,63045525.72727273,92909162.0909091,11.0,,,,,,,9592778.0,26842778.0,4.0,95986188.0,143519521.33333334,6.0,,,,54478416.0,104478416.0,1.0,,,,,,,-14491916.0,508084.0,1.0,442959.5714285714,13714388.142857144,7.0,58640900.571428575,97355186.28571428,7.0,10060497.0,46227163.666666664,3.0,,,,-3927336.0,22262664.0,2.0,,,,119366994.2,187366994.2,5.0,,,157034037.40460858,115031101.79854798,15.875,6.375,102557850.13709407

Hilditch regularly watches the old programmes of his presumably-deceased mother while he cooks her recipes, and collects material about his mother. Hilditch offers to help Felicia, however, his motives for doing so are initially unclear, and it is subsequently suggested through flashback sequences that he has in the past befriended but then turned on vulnerable young women. He refers Felicia to a Bed and Breakfast and offers to drive her to a factory that he suggests could be the one she is looking for, which is on the way to the hospital where the unmarried Hilditch claims he is going to visit his wife. Felicia fails to find Johnny at the factory, but while she is out of the car, Hilditch goes through her bags and steals her money. Subsequently Felicia comes across a Jamaican Christian witnessee who offers Felicia a free overnight stay at a church home. While staying at the hostel, Felicia discovers that her money has gone, and after appearing to accuse others at the home of stealing the money, flees the hostel for Hilditch's house. Hilditch has meanwhile discovered Johnny's whereabouts, in the barracks where he is still serving with the army, but does not disclose this to Felicia. He does however tell her that his wife has died, and that she suggested that Felicia abort her unborn child. After the abortion, which Hilditch pays for, he takes her back to his house and gives her an overdose of sleeping pills. While digging out in his garden, the Jamaican Christian parishioner and a new convert enter his yard and begin to preach about Jesus. Hilditch feels flashes of guilt and confesses that he did, in fact, steal and cheat Felicia. Upstairs in the house, Felicia awakens from her sleep and struggles down the stairs. Hilditch finds her trying to escape the house, but allows her to leave. He then walks to his kitchen, where he hangs himself from a clothes line.series of murders birmingham",False,tt0165773,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1970268,0,0,-6.613177496665427,15.965307217698705,,,-12143288.0,2856712.0,,,-6618873.75,17,13631126.25,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,62194351.6,80935459.2,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,58843409.0,62548947.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13631126.25,-6618873.75,2.125,4.0,73407251.10798967

But the determined family refuses to give up and eventually finds its place in the poverty-stricken city. Meanwhile, on the other end of Calcutta, disillusioned Texas doctor Max Lowe  has arrived in search of spiritual enlightenment after the loss of a patient but encounters misfortune as soon as he arrives. After being tricked by a young prostitute, he is roughed up by thugs and left bleeding in the street without his documents and valuable possessions. Hasari comes to Max's aid and takes the injured doctor to the ""City of Joy,"" a slum area populated with lepers and poor people that becomes the Pals' new home and the American's home away from home. Max spends a lot of time in the neighborhood, but he doesn't want to become too involved with the residents because he is afraid of becoming emotionally attached to them. He soon, however, is coaxed into helping his new-found friends by a strong-willed Irish woman , who runs the local clinic.

However, upon arriving at Hotel Adlon, Martin realizes his briefcase was left at the airport. He takes a taxicab driven by a woman named Gina, but on the way to the airport, the cab crashes off a bridge into the river. Martin is knocked unconscious upon impact, but Gina saves him from drowning before fleeing from the scene to avoid the police, since she is an illegal immigrant from Bosnia. On Thanksgiving day, Martin regains consciousness at the hospital after being in a coma for four days. Martin returns to his hotel, only to discover another man with his wife, who claims she doesn't know him. He attempts to contact his old colleague Prof. Rodney Cole, who is unavailable due to Thanksgiving in the U.S. Martin then heads to the office of Prof. Leo Bressler, whom he is scheduled to meet that day. However, he sees the impostor, ""Martin B,"" already in a meeting with Bressler. As Martin attempts to prove his identity, Martin B shows him his ID and family photo – both of which have Martin's name, only with his face replaced by that of the impostor. Disillusioned by the identity crisis, Martin falls unconscious and finds himself back at the hospital. Smith, an assassin sent to target him, kills Nurse Gretchen Erfurt, but Martin escapes. He then seeks help from Nurse Erfurt's friend, private investigator and former Stasi agent Ernst Jürgen. Martin's only clues are his notebook and Gina, who works at a diner after being fired from the taxicab company since the incident. While Martin attempts to persuade Gina into helping him clear up his identity problem, Jürgen digs up information related to Martin and the biotechnology summit. He discovers that the summit is to be attended by Prince Shada of Saudi Arabia, who is funding a secret project headed by Bressler. Prince Shada has survived numerous assassination attempts from extremists in his own country, and Jürgen suspects that Martin's identity theft may be another attempt at taking the Prince's life. Meanwhile, Smith and another assassin, Jones, attempt to eliminate Martin and Gina, but the couple escape after a fight at her apartment, in which Gina kills Smith, and a car chase. Martin looks at his notebook and sees a set of numbers written by his spouse. The numbers correspond to words found on specific pages of the notebook, which appear as secret codes. Using the schedule written on the notebook, Martin confronts Liz, who tells him that he left his briefcase at the airport. Meanwhile, Jürgen receives Cole at his office, and discovers that both Cole and Martin are members of a secret squad of mercenaries known as ""Section 15."" Realizing Cole is there to kill him, Jürgen commits suicide by drinking cyanide-laced coffee in order to protect Martin. After retrieving his briefcase, Martin parts ways with Gina. She sees him kidnapped by Cole and Jones, and steals a taxicab and chases after Cole's van. Martin wakes up in a car park and is told by Cole that Martin Harris is a cover name, and that he, Liz and Martin B are assassins sent to target the summit. Because he injured his head during the car crash, his memory was altered and he believed that his fake Martin Harris persona was his own identity. Gina rushes in and stops Jones from killing Martin as Cole hides in his van. There is a brief fight between Jones and Gina that ends when Gina drives her car into Jones and squashes him against Cole's van. Gina drives her car into the van and sends it plummeting out the car park with Cole still inside, killing him in the process. Martin discovers a hidden compartment in his briefcase and finds two Canadian passports, realizing he and Liz were in Berlin three months prior to plant a bomb in the suite that is to be occupied later by Prince Shada for the summit. Having become aware of his own role in the assassination plot, Martin seeks to redeem himself by thwarting the assassination and heads for the hotel with Gina in tow. They are immediately arrested by security, but Martin convinces them of his presence in the hotel three months back. He then realizes that Prince Shada is not the target, but Bressler, who has developed a genetically modified breed of corn that is capable of surviving any climate, easing the world's food supply problem. With Bressler's death and the theft of his research, billions of dollars would fall into the wrong hands. Liz uses her own copy of the notebook's secret codes to remotely access Bressler's laptop and steal the data. After being convinced there is a bomb, security evacuates the hotel. Seeing that their assassination attempt has been foiled, Liz tries to disarm the bomb, but cannot reach the disarmament button and is killed as a section of the Adlon is blown up. Martin kills Martin B, the last remaining assassin, before he could murder Bressler. Bressler later announces his project to the world, which will be displayed to public for free, while Martin and Gina board a train with new passports, adopting new identities.taxi hotel coma taxi driver prince briefcase hospital stolen identity",False,tt1401152,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,130786397,1,0,3.359546566666667,1.026708649479613,33245078.333333332,93022856.1111111,33010483.85714286,68017626.71428572,7739015.0,25739015.0,48976460.833333336,28,98851460.83333333,12.0,159059503.5,7.0,257559503.5,2.0,-13651216.0,2.0,36348784.0,1.0,12649163.75,25.0,42024163.75,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,5193068.0,5.0,26193068.0,1.0,,0.0,,,26246018.0,75446018.0,4.0,159047763.0,289047763.0,1.0,,,,57466670.0,82466670.0,1.0,85982151.71428572,140125008.85714287,7.0,-5117111.0,94882889.0,1.0,,,,-7788574.0,22211426.0,1.0,153554436.5,230387769.83333334,12.0,-7788574.0,22211426.0,1.0,256269857.0,328269857.0,2.0,,,,,,,45934376.75,103309376.75,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1433812.5,40433812.5,2.0,41638266.75,80138266.75,4.0,,,,-12354673.0,20645327.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,76310473.4,133310473.4,5.0,,,92195396.01666667,42445396.016666666,8.375,4.0,83145037.44008958

He is using word association and dream interpretation as part of his approach to Freud's radical new science of psychoanalysis, and finds that Fraulein Spielrein's condition was triggered by the humiliation and sexual arousal she felt as a child due to her short-tempered father's habit of spanking her naked. These conflicting feelings were compounded by her instinctive knowledge  that she had done nothing to deserve such a punishment and in fact that she may have been a stand-in for her mother in her father's abuse . Also, her affluent Russian Jewish family afforded her an exceptional education in preparation for university study, although not on the subject of sex, and she was a virgin. Her intelligence and energy were immediately recognized and encouraged by Jung and Eugen Bleuler, the head of the hospital, and since she plans to study medicine they allow her to assist them in their experiments, including measuring the physical reactions of subjects during word association, to provide empirical data as a scientific basis for psychoanalysis and ameliorate the more sensational aspects of Freud's theories, which contend that all mental illness is rooted in childhood sexual experience, be it real or fantasy. She soon learns that much of this new science is founded on the doctors' observations of themselves, each other, and their families, not just their patients. The doctors correspond at length before they meet, and begin sharing their dreams and analysing each other, and Freud adopts Jung as his heir and agent. Jung finds in Sabina a kindred spirit with a unique perspective as her self-awareness sharpens, and their attraction deepens in what was already well known at the time as transference. Jung's resistance to the idea of infidelity, and breaking the taboo of sex with a patient, is undercut by the wild and unrepentant confidences of another brilliant, philandering, unstable psychoanalyst who comes under his care, Otto Gross. He decries monogamy in general and suggests that resistance to transference is symptomatic of the repression of normal, healthy sexual impulses, exhorting Jung to indulge himself with abandon. Jung finally begins their affair, which in the film includes rudimentary bondage and spanking Sabina at times. Things become even more tangled as he becomes her advisor to her dissertation; he publishes not only his studies of her as a patient but eventually her treatise as well. Her original ideas are rooted not only in her insights into her childhood trauma, but the intensity and conflicts in their relationship. Spielrein's thesis suggests that truly heroic, original creations can only emerge from the crucible of great conflict, such as the attraction of opposites and the breaking of taboos, and thus the instinct for creation is inextricably tied to a drive to destruction, and that these feelings and ideas are not restricted to sexual expression despite their roots in the biological drive to reproduce. This includes, finally, his refusal to give her a love child, which is the story behind the reference to Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen operas: they see themselves in the legend of Siegfried, the archetypal Teutonic hero born from a forbidden union. After his attempt to confine their relationship again to doctor and patient, she appeals to Freud for his professional help, and forces Jung to tell Freud the truth about their relationship, reminding him that she could have publicly damaged him but did not want to. Freud uses his knowledge of the relationship to bully Jung, who is planning to publish new theories quite different from Freud's. Jung is working on Psychology of the Unconscious, and his emerging theories of symbolism, archetypes and transformation are heavily influenced by the theme of Sabina's dissertation and their discussion of the Siegfried mythology but he does not cite her in publication, acknowledging her only in private, and Freud does the same, despite the fact that he welcomed her defection from Jung's sphere of influence. Jung throws off his mantle as Freud's ""son and heir"", and their friendship ends. Shortly after Freud dismisses the new ideas expressed by Spielrein in the local meeting of the new psychoanalytic society in Vienna, she marries another Russian physician, and leaves both men behind her. Sabina Spielrein, by then a successful child psychologist and already a widow, was killed with her children by the Nazis during World War II.based on novel or book psychoanalysis sigmund freud biography based on a true story spanking cigar smoking cheating husband patient carl jung",False,tt1571222,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,27462041,1,0,0.8308027333333333,1.026708649479613,,,20984230.0,43984230.0,,,35742860.55555555,9,67884519.22222222,9.0,4606607.0,4.0,56106607.0,1.0,-1177662.0,3.0,4489004.666666667,3.0,,0.0,,,20042841.5,6.0,56792841.5,2.0,-12354673.0,2.0,20645327.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,4606607.0,56106607.0,1.0,10024022.4,48324022.4,5.0,,,,4606607.0,56106607.0,1.0,-3455538.0,44462.0,1.0,4606607.0,56106607.0,1.0,12697492.666666666,39864159.333333336,3.0,,,,13835670.0,39335670.0,3.0,,,,-4838130.833333333,7611869.166666667,6.0,,,,12697492.666666666,39864159.333333336,3.0,12697492.666666666,39864159.333333336,3.0,,,,,,,,,,99266061.0,129266061.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,48328800.0,74268800.0,5.0,,,,-10385849.0,3964682.0,1.0,,,41183659.87777778,9371994.811111111,3.0,3.2,83145037.44008958

He is propositioned by his friend and former partner-in-crime, Billy Norton , to live in apartment, but he has to work for Billy's criminal gang. On his way to a welcome back party, Mitchel saves a woman, Penny , from being mugged. At the party, Billy propositions Mitchel again. Mitchel is told by Billy and their contact, Danny ([[Stephen Graham , that his sister, Briony  is in the basement, and he ""saves"" her from sleeping with a drug addict. After the party, Mitchel meets Penny again, and she offers him a job to help her friend, retired actress, Charlotte. Mitchel goes to a train station to visit his friend Joe, a blind homeless Big Issue salesman and gives him a knife to protect himself. The next day, Mitchel meets Charlotte  and her friend, Jordan . He is given the job and Jordan gives him a tour of the mansion, including a garage full of Charlotte's ex-husband, Tim's cars. At his apartment, DS Bailey  visits Mitchel and tells him to avoid Billy and forces Mitchel to bribe him. Mitchel talks to Billy about DS Bailey, whom Billy can't stand. Joe is mugged, then brutally beaten by two young footballers and left for dead. At the hospital, Dr. Sanji Raju  lets Mitchel visit Joe, who wants Mitchel to avenge his death. The next day, Billy tells Mitchel that he knows about the car collection and that his boss wants them. At Joe's funeral, Dr. Raju tells Mitchel that he wants to date Briony, which Mitchel accepts. Mitchel goes to the pub and asks Danny to find as much as he can about the two footballers. That night, Mitchel is kidnapped by Billy and taken to his boss, Rob Gant , who tells Mitchel that he will be collecting money. Charlotte and Mitchel escape from the paparazzi to her mansion in the countryside. Charlotte mentions to Mitchel that something happened to her in Italy, which is implied to be a drug overdose. Jordan tells Mitchel that the Italy incident is that she was raped by a drug addict in Italy, who never got caught and is currently on life support after overdosing on quaaludes. Gant threatens DS Bailey not to force Mitchel to bribe him. Later that evening, Mitchel and Billy meet Gant in a garage, where he shoots a black teenager, whom Gant was led to believe by Billy to be on of the Nation of Islam members who beat up Mitchel and scared off Billy whiling collecting for Gant. Gant yells at Billy, Mitchel protects Billy and yells at Gant, who claims Mitchel said to kill anyone. Gant tells Mitchel to meet him at a restaurant the next night, for an unknown arrangement. Charlotte tells Mitchel she loves him. Later, Mitchel and Gant meet and Gant puts Mitchel in charge of collecting money in Streatham, Clapham and Kennington. Gant reveals that the footballer has a future in professional football and is being scouted by professional teams. Mitchel tells Gant that if he was a gangster, Gant would be the first person he killed and Mitchel would take everything that Gant has, claiming that he isn't a gangster. The next day, Mitchel tells Jordan he won't take the job. Gant orders his henchmen, Fletcher ([[Matt King  and Beaumont  to kill the doctor who owns Mitchel's apartment. Mitchel follows the footballer into a tunnel and plans to shoot him when he stops, but the boy walks off. Mitchel visits Charlotte and tells her that he loves her and the two sleep together. Mitchel sees Billy's van and attacks Billy who says Gant sent him to kill Mitchel and warns Mitchel to look for ""a big Bosnian fucker"". Mitchel borrows one of Charlotte's husband's Rolls Royces and confronts Billy at a pub. He beats Billy, who says Gant will kill everyone who Mitchel loves and Mitchel steals the money Billy collected for Gant. Mitchel tells Briony to get out of the country and go to Paris, telling her she is in danger. Mitchel and Jordan find Billy's dead body in the front garden and the Bosnian, named Storbor, outside the gate. Mitchel asks Jordan to help him and Jordan agrees to help kill Storbor. The two follow Storbor to a nightclub where they meet him and the drug addict from the party named Whiteboy . Mitchel takes the two to his van where Jordan, who has been hiding in the van the whole time, garrotes Storbor through the throat. They drive to the countryside mansion and Whiteboy begs Mitchel not to kill him, but Mitchel shoots Whiteboy in the head. Mitchel lifts up a gate, causing the pit where they dumped Storbor and Whiteboy, to get flooded. Meanwhile, Briony had laughed off hiding in Paris and is in her London flat having sex with Dr. Raju, when Gant comes by, and offscreen kills them both with a hammer. DS Bailey  visits Jordan, who was expecting him based on Mitchel's advice, and leads him at gunpoint into a darkened stairway, killing him. tells Bailey to go down the stairs. Charlotte is shown in LA, where police are on TV talking about paparazzi stalking Charlotte. Mitchel enters Gant's house and knocks out Gant's wife, while Fletcher and Beaumont are outside. Mitchel walks into Gant's bedroom and shoots Gant in the head and takes the £60,000. He goes home and hides the box under the floorboards. As he leaves the house, he is stabbed repeatedly by the footballer who says someone, heavily implied to be Gant, told him Mitchel was looking for him, and leaves Mitchel for dead. We then see Jordan sitting on a bench at the countryside mansion with a gun, while two police officers are walking towards him in the distance. The screen cuts to black and we hear 4 gunshots, either implying Jordan killed himself, killed one of the police officers and was shot by the other, or killed both of the police officers.loss of loved one paparazzi gangster violence murdered sister death duringcreditsstinger",False,tt1213648,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,4644108,1,0,-4.383165077125683,-2.2977368060284267,,,-4109885.0,53390115.0,,,16510220.0,7,67760220.0,4.0,42755204.625,8.0,75789570.625,8.0,212116865.0,6.0,282950198.3333333,3.0,-6949439.0,12.0,11587494.666666666,3.0,37404677.0,17.0,63154677.0,2.0,21844061.0,9.0,73419061.0,4.0,145465464.33333334,6.0,179398797.66666666,3.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,39941531.666666664,133274865.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2569795.2,24949795.2,5.0,,,,,,,,,107722859.89880952,67021007.565476194,8.125,3.857142857142857,102557850.13709407

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone--tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth, and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=64232space mission loss space astronaut space station trapped in space",False,tt1454468,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,716392705,1,0,5.822787666666668,-3.2525921248712315,,,294880818.79310346,372749784.3103448,714977245.2222222,858588356.3333334,,0,,,75197840.0,16.0,121597840.0,5.0,28976270.0,12.0,96976270.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,-26250799.0,1749201.0,1.0,7851719.0,25026984.5,2.0,60770701.11111111,87270701.1111111,9.0,-8962258.0,41037742.0,1.0,49958337.428571425,74101194.57142857,7.0,101517243.0,131217243.0,10.0,326882152.5,429882152.5,2.0,,,,137807719.57142857,206879148.14285713,14.0,,,,642362261.0,773612261.0,6.0,,,,-6040249.0,69959751.0,1.0,524780553.4444444,657558331.2222222,9.0,,,,,,,-12041304.0,57958696.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,50630608.0,80630608.0,1.0,-6672830.5,6827169.5,2.0,99445758.5,157445758.5,2.0,60339910.0,116839910.0,2.0,394523243.71428573,472666100.85714287,7.0,,,,,,109287055.0,52087055.0,3.5,3.0,77725040.92008552

Of an eastern coast lies Mega-City One, a vast, violent metropolis containing 800 million residents where 17,000 crimes are reported daily and ""Slo-Mo"", an addictive new drug that slows the user's perception of time to 1% of normal, has been introduced. The only force of order are the Judges, who act as judge, jury, and executioner. Judge Dredd is tasked by the Chief Judge with evaluating rookie Judge Anderson, a psychic who has failed the tests to become a full Judge. Elsewhere, in the 200-story slum tower block Peach Trees, drug lord Madeline Madrigal, known as Ma-Ma, infuses three men with Slo-Mo and throws their skinned bodies from the top of the tower. Dredd and Anderson respond and learn of a drug den, which they assault. They arrest Kay, one of Ma-Ma's henchmen, after Anderson psychically detects his involvement in the murders. To prevent Kay being removed from the building and interrogated about her operation, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building using its blast shields under the pretense of a security test, preventing the Judges from leaving or summoning help. Ma-Ma orders Dredd's and Anderson's deaths. Several groups of armed men unsuccessfully try to kill the pair as the Judges proceed through the building with Kay to find safety. After arriving at one floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men using gatling guns that cut through the building's concrete walls and residents. The gunfire damages one of the tower's outer walls, allowing the Judges to call for backup. Ma-Ma sends her right-hand man Caleb to confirm the Judges' deaths. Dredd throws Caleb from the tower in full view of Ma-Ma. Suspicious of Ma-Ma's motives for obliterating an entire floor, Dredd beats Kay for information. Anderson intervenes and uses her abilities to read Kay's mind. She learns Peach Trees is the center of Slo-Mo production and distribution. Anderson suggests they hide while awaiting assistance but Dredd insists on moving up the tower in pursuit of Ma-Ma. Judges Volt and Guthrie respond to Dredd's call, but are unable to access the tower when Ma-Ma's computer expert persuades the pair that call is part of the security drill. While Dredd and Anderson are confronted by armed children, Kay escapes, takes Anderson hostage and brings her to Ma-Ma's base on the 200th floor. While Dredd works his way toward Ma-Ma, she bribes the corrupt Judges Lex, Kaplan, Chan, and Alvarez to kill Dredd. After meeting Chan, Dredd notices that he does not ask about Anderson's status, instigating a fight in which Chan is killed. Kay dies when he attempts to execute Anderson with her own weapon, triggering an explosive failsafe when it does not recognize its wielder. Anderson escapes and meets Kaplan, whom she kills after reading her mind. Elsewhere, Dredd kills Alvarez but runs out of ammunition and is shot by Lex. Anderson arrives and kills Lex as he prepares to finish Dredd. The pair obtain the code to Ma-Ma's apartment via her hacker and confront her. Anderson is wounded by one of Ma-Ma's men. Ma-Ma informs Dredd that a device on her wrist will detonate explosives on the top floors upon her death and destroy the building. Dredd, believing the signal will not reach the top floor's explosives through the tower's concrete floors and walls from below, forces Ma-Ma to inhale Slo-Mo and throws her from the building to her death. In the aftermath. Anderson accepts she has failed her evaluation by getting disarmed, and leaves. The Chief Judge asks Dredd about Anderson's performance. He responds that she has passed.usa corruption crime fighter judge metropolis gangster law post-apocalyptic dystopia executive case police futuristic based on comic survival criminal justice drug lord based on graphic novel female villain",True,tt1343727,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,41037742,1,0,-0.21839062197915274,-10.812845724436539,,,49282869.0,68032869.0,,,-4012679.0,7,55987321.0,1.0,,0.0,,,-6645135.0,13.0,29604865.0,4.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,3526604.0,2.0,26959937.333333332,3.0,,0.0,,,-4012679.0,7.0,55987321.0,1.0,25988484.0,53928426.25,4.0,,,,69487321.0,93049821.0,8.0,,,,,,,113792743.1111111,141237187.55555555,9.0,,,,,,,111322663.5,227822663.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,67714.0,867714.0,1.0,33787263.0,45667147.5,2.0,,,,,,,,,,18064306.666666668,41397640.0,3.0,,,,101439742.75,117939742.75,4.0,,,,81925502.16666667,105258835.5,6.0,386090727.0,586090727.0,1.0,69421930.14285715,80307644.42857143,7.0,,,,,,,,,42134861.083333336,-2785972.25,3.625,2.25,123186632.01668148

Hanna Screenplay, production draft  http://www.focusawards2011.com/workspace/hanna-screenplay.pdf desert, where Hanna meets Sebastian  and Rachel , a bohemian British couple on a camper-van holiday with their teenage daughter, Sophie , and their younger son, Miles . She sneaks into the family's camper-van and hitches a ferry ride to Spain, with the goal of reaching Germany. She and Sophie become close, and spend some time meeting with some local boys. Meanwhile, Wiegler hires a former agent called Isaacs  to capture Hanna before she can reunite with her father in Germany. Hanna travels with the family as they drive north. Isaacs and his men trail them and eventually corner Hanna and the family, but she manages to escape, killing one of them. Wiegler arrives, interrogates the family, and finds out that Hanna is heading to Berlin. Arriving at the address her father had told her, Hanna meets with Knepler , an eccentric old magician, who lives in a Grimm's Fairy Tale themed house in an abandoned amusement park. It's Hanna's 16th birthday and Knepler makes her breakfast with egg and waffles, and lets her listen to some music, which she has not had access to in the forest. Hanna plans to rendezvous with her father. However, Wiegler and Isaacs arrive. Hanna escapes, but not before she overhears Wiegler and Isaacs make comments that suggest Erik is not her real father. Now confused, she eventually meets her father at her grandmother's apartment, where Wiegler had tried to find her, and then killed her grandmother. Hanna then learns that Erik is not her father; Erik was actually once a recruiter for a program in which pregnant women were recruited from abortion clinics so that the C.I.A. could alter their children's DNA, enhancing their strength, stamina, and reflexes while suppressing emotions like fear and pity in order to create a batch of super-soldiers. However, the project was shut down for unexplained reasons and all the women and their genetically-modified children were eliminated. Erik tried to escape with Hanna and her mother Johanna Zadek , but Wiegler attacked their vehicle, where two-year-old Hanna had been reading her Grimm’s Fairy Tales. Wiegler shot Johanna, who then collapsed from gruesome injuries after making away some distance from the burning car, its bumper angled up against a tree. Erik managed to escape with two-year-old Hanna. Wiegler and Isaacs arrive, intent on killing them; Erik acts as a distraction to allow Hanna to escape. Erik kills Isaacs, but is shot and killed by Wiegler, who then goes back to the Grimm house. Hanna is there, having just discovered Knepler dead, his corpse hung upside down after being used for archery practice by Isaacs. After a chase into the woods toward the abandoned amusement park, Hanna and Wiegler confront one another. Hanna pleads for an end to the killing, saying she doesn't want to hurt anyone else. Wiegler says she just wants to talk, but Hanna starts walking away. Upset by this act of defiance, Wiegler shoots Hanna, who responds by shooting Wiegler with an arrow she pulled from Knepler's body, using a bungee cord she found to propel it. Hanna is knocked to the ground with a bullet in her left lower abdomen. She gets up, gets her bearings and follows Wiegler into a tunnel, noticing a deer, and then seeing Wiegler fleeing up a nearby water slide. An unarmed Hanna chases Wiegler to the top of the slide's stairs, as Wiegler continually shoots at her. Near the top, it becomes clear that Hanna's arrow did more damage than Wiegler's bullet, and a disoriented Wiegler falls and slides down the water flume right when she is about to shoot Hanna, dropping her handgun. Hanna follows the wounded Wiegler, picks up the dropped gun, comments on how she just barely missed Wiegler's heart, and shoots her. The bookend scene mirrors the opening of the film in which Hanna hunts and kills the reindeer.assassin self sacrifice empowerment strong woman warrior woman secret agent female killer teenage girl female protagonist finland duringcreditsstinger female empowerment feminisim",False,tt0993842,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,63782078,1,0,1.1260692666666667,1.026708649479613,31728238.0,56137328.90909091,,,,,38723992.0,4,77057325.33333333,3.0,148889824.33333334,10.0,249556491.0,3.0,,0.0,,,23765845.5,14.0,76015845.5,6.0,19237563.0,4.0,74237563.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,96207004.0,125207004.0,2.0,,,,81789359.71428572,123967931.14285715,14.0,,,,,,,,,,96207004.0,125207004.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,208814229.0,258147562.33333334,3.0,,,,208814229.0,258147562.33333334,3.0,,,,-11779789.333333334,11220210.666666666,3.0,,,,,,,,,119216806.20833333,57654306.208333336,4.0,3.25,83145037.44008958

Santa and the elves deliver presents to every child in the world using advanced equipment and military precision. These complex operations are micromanaged by Santa's oldest son Steve and his obsequious elfin assistant Peter  at mission control underneath the North Pole, while Steve's clumsy and panophobic younger brother Arthur answers the letters to Santa. During a delivery operation, when a child wakes up and almost sees Santa, an elf back in the S-1 inadvertently presses a button, causing a present to fall off a conveyor and go unnoticed. Having completed his 70th mission, Santa is portrayed as far past his prime and whose role in field operations now is largely symbolic. Nonetheless, he is held in high esteem, and delivers a congratulatory speech to the enraptured elves. Much to Steve's frustration, who has long anticipated succeeding his father, Santa announces he looks forward to his 71st. During their family Christmas dinner, Arthur's suggestion for the family to play a board game degenerates into a petty quarrel between Santa and Steve, while Grand-Santa, bored by retirement, resentfully criticises their over-modernisation. Distraught, the various family members leave the dinner table. When Arthur humbly compliments Steve that he believes he will be a great Santa Claus, Steve rudely dismisses Arthur's overture; later, their father shares with Mrs. Claus his grave doubts about his self-identity should he retire. Meanwhile, an elf named Bryony finds the missed present—a wrapped bicycle that has yet to be delivered—and alerts Steve and his elf-assistant to the problem. Arthur is alarmed when he recognises the present as a gift for Gwen, a little girl to whom he had personally replied. Arthur alerts his father, who is at a loss as to how to handle the situation; Steve argues that one missed present out of billions is an acceptable error whose correction can wait a few days. Grand-Santa, on the other hand, proposes delivering the gift using Evie, his old wooden sleigh, and the descendants of the original eight reindeer, forcefully whisking away a reluctant Arthur and a stowaway Bryony. They get lost, lose reindeer, and land in danger several times, ultimately being mistaken for aliens and causing an international military incident. Through all this, Arthur eventually learns to his compounding disappointment that Grand-Santa's true motive is to fulfil his ego, that Steve refuses to help them out of petty resentment, and that his own father has gone to bed, apparently content. Finally, stranded in Cuba after losing the sleigh, Arthur renews his sense of purpose—that it all comes down to preventing a child's disappointment—and with Grand-Santa's help manages to recover the sleigh. Meanwhile, the elves grow increasingly alarmed at rumours of this neglected delivery and the Clauses' unthinkable indifference, sending them into a panic. In response, Santa, Mrs. Claus, and Steve take the high-tech sleigh to deliver a superior present—to the wrong child. Santa's navigation error and Steve's mishandling of the mistaken identity throw into sharp relief their intentions against those of Arthur. After much difficulty, and ultimately with Mrs. Claus' and Bryony's help, all the male Clauses arrive at Gwen's house before she awakens, only to have all but Arthur quarrel about who gets to actually place the gift. Noticing that only Arthur truly cares about the girl's feelings, the elder Clauses collectively realise that he is the sole worthy successor. As a result, Santa gives Arthur the honour and Steve forfeits his birthright to his brother. In a fitting conclusion, Gwen glimpses a snow-bearded Arthur in a wind-buffeted sweater just before vanishing into the night. With the crisis resolved, Santa goes into a happy retirement with Mrs. Claus; he also becomes grand-Santa's much-desired new companion. Meanwhile, Steve finds true contentment as Chief Operating Officer while Bryony is promoted to Vice-President of Packing. In a nod to traditionalism once neglected, the high-tech S-1 is re-christened EVIE and refitted to be pulled by a 5000-reindeer team—led by the original eight reindeer, all of whom managed to return safely via innate homing abilities. Finally, Arthur happily guides the entire enterprise in the proper spirit as the new Santa.holiday santa claus assistant sleigh wish reindeer family north pole high tech clumsiness duringcreditsstinger letter to santa claus woman director christmas elf",False,tt1430607,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,149717124,1,0,0.7613779294117647,1.026708649479613,58671417.31034483,97916244.89655173,123854982.0,198521648.66666666,,,128214218.14285715,7,173142789.57142857,7.0,137339652.66666666,16.0,172339652.66666666,3.0,99074928.54545455,8.0,154620383.0909091,11.0,108387774.76470588,19.0,156552806.4117647,17.0,87343085.0,13.0,100942496.66666667,3.0,153712432.0,0.0,189712432.0,1.0,,0.0,,,43798906.0,11.0,72548906.0,4.0,557841637.0,609841637.0,1.0,112414920.0,192019440.2,10.0,788212738.0,938212738.0,1.0,23583100.5,50758366.0,2.0,50630608.0,80630608.0,1.0,23258092.25,41595725.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,29120010.0,178120010.0,1.0,,,,,,,-5966835.0,2033165.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26947965.0,86947965.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,145694209.48677653,108267285.30281204,9.25,6.571428571428571,83145037.44008958

His chief courtiers agree to follow him in this vow, though one  argues that they will not be able to fulfil this plan. Berowne's claim is proven correct almost instantly. The Princess of France comes to Navarre to discuss the status of the province of Aquitaine. Though the King does not grant them access to his palace , each of the courtiers falls in love with one of her handmaidens, and the King falls in love with the Princess herself. The men attempt to hide their own loves and expose those of their fellows. At the end, after a masked ball in which the pairs of lovers are comically mismatched, all the amours are revealed. However, before the expected nuptial consummation, the women demand that the men prove they are serious by waiting for them.

They spend the night together but agree to be friends. Then one year later, Emma is working as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant in London and Dexter is travelling the world, drinking and promiscuously going through several girlfriends. Eventually Dexter becomes a wealthy and highly successful television presenter on a raucous late-night show. Although meeting once in a while throughout the years, Emma meets Ian , a comedian whom she doesn't find funny. The two start dating anyway and she becomes a school teacher. Dexter's once-glamorous mother , now diagnosed with cancer, is unimpressed with the nature of his TV show. His father  is also disappointed with him and bans him from the family house. Emma is growing steadily more irritated with Ian, so she and Dexter organize a meeting over dinner. Dexter gets drunk, insults Emma, flirts with a blonde down the hall and generally ignores her most of the time. After making a public scene Emma storms off, suggesting that they break off their friendship entirely. A few years later, Emma's former roommate gets married and both she and Dexter are invited to the wedding. There she discovers that Dexter now has a new fiancee, Sylvie , and is on the way to becoming a father. She tries to hide the fact that she is upset and they share a very brief kiss. Dexter learns that Sylvie is actually having an affair with an old friend of his. They divorce. Emma and Ian split up and she becomes a published author. Emma moves to Paris, where Dexter visits in the hopes that they will get together again. By this time, despite their one-night-stand, Emma now has a new boyfriend , who plays piano in a jazz band. Smitten and taken aback by this knowledge, Dexter begins to leave. But Emma, having second thoughts, chases after him and catches up, resulting in their sharing a passionate kiss.

However, they are betrayed by Milady, who gives the blueprints to the Duke of Buckingham . Upon returning to France, the Musketeers are forced to disband by Cardinal Richelieu  for their failure, and they end up on the streets of Paris. One year later, a young man named D'Artagnan  leaves his village in Gascony for Paris in hopes of becoming a Musketeer as his father was, only to learn that they no longer exist. At a rural bar, D'Artagnan accuses Captain Rochefort , the leader of Richelieu's guard, of offending his horse, and challenges him to a duel. Rochefort shoots him while he is distracted but he is saved by Milady de Winter. Arriving in Paris, D'Artagnan by coincidence separately encounters Athos, Porthos and Aramis accidentally offending all three scheduling duels with each at 12:00, 1:00 and 2:00&nbsp;pm respectively. Athos brings Porthos and Aramis to the duel as his seconds. D'Artagnan realises they are the Musketeers he is seeking. He is prepared to continue with the duel but Richelieu's guards break it up. The three are inspired by D'Artagnan and fight together and defeat the soldiers, but later are summoned before the young King Louis XIII ([[Freddie Fox  and his wife, Queen Anne . Richelieu asks the king to execute the four, but the queen is impressed by their bravery and the king congratulates them and invites them to an event, which to Athos' anger, turns out to be Buckingham's arrival  Later, Richelieu orders Milady, who is actually working for him, to plant false love letters among Queen Anne's possessions, steal Queen Anne's diamond necklace, and take it to the Tower of London to frame Queen Anne as having an affair with the Duke of Buckingham. The affair would force King Louis to execute Queen Anne and declare war on England. At this point, the people would demand a more experienced leader: Richelieu himself. But Milady demands that Richelieu declare in writing that she is working on behalf of France, to protect herself in case of palace intrigue. The false letters  are found by a maid and are given to King Louis and he is advised by Richelieu to set up a ball at which Queen Anne would be forced to wear the necklace. If she doesn't, then her affair is real, and there will be war against England. Queen Anne's lady-in-waiting Constance Bonacieux  discovers Richelieu's plan and asks the Musketeers to stop him. At the dock, Constance takes D'Artagnan's hat, cape and horse to create a diversion of the guards standing in front of the boat. At Calais, they find guards and Constance pretends to be d'Artagnan and distracts the guards while the musketeers get on a boat. In London, Milady warns Buckingham that the Musketeers have arrived to take revenge on him. Milady instructs Buckingham of all their tendencies in battle, but Athos predicts this and the Musketeers resolve to do just the opposite. Milady later escapes in a coach, taking the necklace with her. Buckingham captures D'Artagnan, but he was a decoy to let the Musketeers steal the airship. The Musketeers rescue D'Artagnan, demolishing the top floor of the Tower in the process. Meanwhile, the coach stops in a clearing in the woods and the driver is revealed to be Planchet, the Musketeer's servant and occasional helper. The musketeers pick up the coach and capture Milady. She gives up Richelieu's authorisation to try to save her life. When Athos intends to kill her anyway, she jumps out of the airship into the English Channel to spare him from having to pull the trigger. The Musketeers return to Paris with the necklace, but in the air near the city they are attacked by Rochefort in another airship, as Milady had given Richelieu copies of da Vinci's blueprints. D'Artagnan agrees to exchange the necklace for Constance, with whom he is infatuated, but Rochefort knocks him out and captures him as soon as the necklace is in his possession. Rochefort then proceeds to attack the Musketeers' ship, at first gaining the upper hand due to the superior weaponry and armor of his airship. However, the Musketeers lure Rochefort into a storm cloud, burst the balloon of airship and make the ship crash into the Notre Dame Cathedral. On the roof, D'Artagnan duels and stabs Rochefort, who falls to his death. Meanwhile, Constance returns the necklace to Queen Anne. The Musketeers arrive at the ball in Buckingham's now burning airship. However, for the sake of King Louis and his people, they claim that Richelieu had it built for the king, but an attempt was made by Rochefort to sabotage it, also showing King Louis the authorisation Richelieu had given Milady, pretending that it was given to them. Richelieu, impressed by how the Musketeers handled the situation, offers them places in his employ, but they refuse. At sea, Milady  is rescued by Buckingham, who reveals that he knows that she was working for Richelieu and says that he is going to fight against France. The camera backs away and shows Buckingham advancing towards France's shore with a massive fleet of battleships and airships.historical fiction musketeer 17th century 3d",False,tt1509767,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,132274484,1,0,0.7636597866666667,1.026708649479613,39999210.2,96799210.2,17173492.0,50173492.0,33877455.571428575,77734598.42857143,61541849.25,11,95541849.25,4.0,202026505.0,7.0,354526505.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,93147947.0,6.0,121147947.0,1.0,-15033073.0,0.0,741875.0,1.0,175667525.0,7.0,267548151.66666666,3.0,,0.0,,,92603306.5,150103306.5,4.0,,,,,,,,,,69984862.0,102984862.0,1.0,69984862.0,102984862.0,1.0,41651120.75,93651120.75,4.0,-12143288.0,2856712.0,1.0,,,,-12354673.0,20645327.0,1.0,42279986.5,79279986.5,6.0,45528696.0,84528696.0,2.0,85584362.5,137084362.5,2.0,-12327950.0,62172050.0,1.0,,,,78511035.0,132511035.0,1.0,,,,12567974.5,25517974.5,2.0,,,,56578675.5,101578675.5,2.0,,,,,,,72189805.33333333,117189805.33333333,3.0,37000000.0,42000000.0,1.0,,,,66118149.5,99368149.5,4.0,,,167901265.58333334,103470150.65,3.875,2.2,83145037.44008958

Once Roger turns up at Walter's office, it turns out that he is the result of Walter's relationship with a black woman, who is now dead. Walter's father-in-law had warned him that the relationship would be harmful to his career, so he broke it off. Walter attempts to help Roger by telling his wife Vivian  that he wants to adopt him. She accepts, but soon regrets the decision and ends up kicking Walter out. Her father also fires him, taking his car and benefits in the process. Penniless, he and Roger check into a motel, and later move into an apartment. Walter ends up as a manual labourer, shovelling horse manure.

The extracts are from four pieces: Le sacre du printemps , Café Müller, Kontakthof, and Vollmond. These are complemented with interviews and further dance choreographies, which were shot in and around Wuppertal, Germany; the film includes scenes showing the Wuppertal Schwebebahn, an elevated railway, and some dances sequences take place inside its carriages. In the first piece, Le sacre du printemps, (Frühlingsopfer, The Rite of Spring , the dancers of the Tanztheater Wuppertal, separated into male and female groups, move about a stage covered by a thick layer of peat. The following section, Café Müller , portrays a café Pina often visited when she was a child.{{fact}} In a simple setting consisting of some tables and chairs and doors, a small woman dressed in white is entering the café. Two more women, one of whom is obviously blind, appear. They hesitate to step further, as the tables and chairs are obstructing their way. Two men come around and try to remove these barriers. Eventually the blind woman and one of the men stand face to face. The second woman wraps her arms around the other men, but she slips. This part repeats and seems to remain in a loop. The next piece, Kontakthof,  was performed multiple times for Wenders' cameras, with groups of different generations: teenagers, middle-aged dancers, and dancers over 65 (Bausch had choreographed these three variants, as Kontakthof – Mit Teenagern ab 14 , Kontakthof , and Kontakthof – Mit Damen und Herren ab 65 . The film edits these performances into one, cutting between different performers to highlight their different abilities. In the final piece, Vollmond,   the stage is flooded.

The alien's remains cascade into a waterfall. His DNA triggers a biogenetic reaction. In 2089, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a star map in Scotland that matches others from several unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret this as an invitation from humanity's forerunners, the ""Engineers"". Peter Weyland, the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, funds the creation of the scientific vessel Prometheus to follow the map to the distant moon LV-223. The ship's crew travels in stasis while the android David monitors their voyage. Arriving in 2093, they are informed of their mission to find the Engineers. Mission director Meredith Vickers orders the crew to avoid making contact without her permission. The Prometheus lands near a large artificial structure, which a team explores. Inside they find numerous stone cylinders, a monolithic statue of a humanoid head, and the decapitated corpse of a large alien, thought to be an Engineer. They find other bodies and presume the species is extinct. The team takes the Engineer's head back for analysis. David secretly takes a cylinder, while the remaining ones begin leaking a dark liquid. A rapidly approaching storm forces the crew to return to Prometheus, leaving members Millburn and Fifield stranded in the structure. In the ship's lab, the Engineer's DNA is found to match that of humans. David investigates the cylinder and the dark liquid inside. He then intentionally taints a drink with the substance and gives it to an unaware Holloway. Shortly after, Shaw and Holloway have sex. Inside the structure, a snake-like creature kills Millburn, and sprays a corrosive fluid that melts Fifield's helmet. Fifield falls face-first into a puddle of dark liquid. The crew later returns to the structure and finds Millburn's corpse. David separately discovers a control room containing a surviving Engineer in stasis, and a star map highlighting Earth. Holloway's ingestion of the dark liquid leads to an infection that rapidly ravages his body. He is rushed back to Prometheus, but Vickers refuses to let him aboard, and at his urging, burns him to death with a flamethrower. Later, a medical scan reveals that Shaw, despite being sterile, is pregnant with an alien offspring. Fearing the worst, she uses an automated surgery table to extract and subdue the squid-like fetus. Weyland is revealed to have been in stasis aboard Prometheus, and explains to Shaw he wants to ask the Engineers to prevent his death from old age. As Weyland prepares to leave for the structure, Vickers addresses him as ""Father"". Fifield, who has been mutated by the dark liquid, attacks the Prometheus{{'}}s hangar bay and kills several crew members before he is killed. The Prometheus{{'}}s captain, Janek, speculates that the structure was an Engineer military installation that lost control of a virulent biological weapon, the dark liquid. He also determines a part of the structure is a spacecraft. Weyland and a team return to the structure. David speaks to the Engineer, who responds by decapitating him and killing Weyland and his team. Shaw escapes the spacecraft as the Engineer activates it. Shaw warns Janek that the Engineer is planning to release the liquid on Earth and convinces Janek to stop the spacecraft. Janek ejects the lifeboat and rams the Prometheus into the alien craft while Vickers escapes in an escape pod. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground; its wreckage crushes Vickers. Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds that her alien offspring is still alive, and has grown to gigantic size. David's still-active head warns Shaw over the intercom that the Engineer has survived the crash. The Engineer forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto the Engineer; it thrusts a tentacle down the Engineer's throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains, and with his help, launches another Engineer spacecraft. She intends to reach the Engineers' homeworld in an attempt to understand why they wanted to destroy humanity. In the lifeboat, an alien creature bursts out of the Engineer's chest.android dystopia alien spin off creation emergency surgery aftercreditsstinger stasis archeological dig god complex cave drawing prometheus genetic mutation origins of life ted 2023 alienverse alien expanded universe the peter weyland files: ted 2023",False,tt1446714,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,403170142,1,0,2.1013087846153846,-10.812845724436539,503692649.85714287,626835507.0,115100949.25,204106599.5,122840600.33333333,149340600.33333334,,0,,,4024546.0,4.0,11724546.0,5.0,116070171.0,9.0,176070171.0,1.0,73675005.4,13.0,98375005.4,5.0,28488727.5,5.0,44988727.5,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,3029747.0,3.0,10329747.0,1.0,80630820.75,190630820.75,4.0,106804891.66666667,230138225.0,3.0,,,,,,,276533451.0,423200117.6666667,3.0,113369855.5,243369855.5,2.0,104761312.18181819,185897675.8181818,11.0,345651445.4444444,436873667.6666667,9.0,18737652.266666666,58437652.266666666,15.0,,,,87451730.75,170951730.75,4.0,,,,108400928.2,185650928.2,10.0,116366254.8888889,203032921.55555555,9.0,,,,-5185211.0,6814789.0,1.0,-7788574.0,22211426.0,1.0,,,,25939470.5,36819355.0,2.0,139614651.83333334,255447985.16666666,6.0,,,,59841358.4,172841358.4,5.0,,,,46887792.5,77637792.5,2.0,95731557.0,189931557.0,5.0,8950056.5,17200056.5,2.0,,,68297639.38,45057639.38,4.25,2.8,123186632.01668148

Over the course of three days we see her struggle with dementia and with the lack of power that comes with old age, while looking back on defining moments of her personal and professional life, on which she reminisces with her  husband, Denis Thatcher. She is shown as having difficulty distinguishing between the past and present. A theme throughout the film is the personal price which Thatcher has paid for power. Denis is portrayed as somewhat ambivalent about his wife's rise to power, her son Mark lives in South Africa and is shown as having little contact with his mother, and it is implied that Thatcher's relationship with her daughter Carol is at times strained. In flashback we are shown Thatcher's youth, working in the family grocery store in Grantham, listening to the political speeches of her father, whom she idolized - it is also hinted that she had a poor relationship with her mother, a housewife - and announcing that she has won a place at the University of Oxford. She remembers her struggle, as a young lower-middle class woman, to break into a snobbish male-dominated Tory party and find a seat in the House of Commons, along with businessman Denis Thatcher's marriage proposal to her. Her struggles to fit in as a ""Lady Member"" of the House, and as Education Secretary in Edward Heath's cabinet are also shown, as are her friendship with Airey Neave , her decision to stand for Leader of the Conservative Party, and her voice coaching and image change. Further flashbacks examine historical events during her time as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom including the rising unemployment related to her monetarist policies and the tight 1981 budget , the Brixton Riots of 1981, the miners' strike of 1984–5, and the bombing of the Grand Hotel during the 1984 Conservative Party Conference, when she and Denis were almost killed. We also see  her decision to retake the Falkland Islands following the islands' invasion by Argentina in 1982, the sinking of the ARA General Belgrano and Britain's subsequent victory in the Falklands War, her friendship with Ronald Reagan and emergence as a world figure, and the economic boom of the late 1980s. By 1990 Thatcher is shown as an imperious but aging figure, ranting aggressively at her Cabinet, refusing to accept that the Community Charge  is regarded as unjust, and fiercely opposed to European Integration. Her deputy Geoffrey Howe resigns after being humiliated by her in a Cabinet meeting, Michael Heseltine challenges her for the party leadership and her loss of support from her Cabinet colleagues leaves her little choice but to resign as Prime Minister, about which she is shown as still angry and bitter twenty years later. Eventually, Margaret is shown packing up her late husband's belongings, and telling him it's time for him to go. Denis's ghost leaves her fully dressed but without his shoes - in spite of her cries that she is not yet ready to lose him, and she is left alone washing up a teacup.capitalism prime minister margaret thatcher based on a true story argentina british overseas territory war propaganda british politics british prime minister female politician falklands war political leader female prime minister right wing falklands woman director 1980s",False,tt1007029,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,114956699,1,0,7.842822999999999,1.026708649479613,19106289.523809522,31379171.95238095,,,19318901.0,43318901.0,203625879.0,33,229959212.33333334,3.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,105961627.5,19.0,156173046.2777778,18.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,21581616.666666668,4.0,61348283.333333336,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,557841637.0,609841637.0,1.0,47483213.0,64483213.0,2.0,59221142.72727273,72480281.9090909,11.0,-5185211.0,6814789.0,1.0,,,,,,,34906082.0,67906082.0,2.0,26964737.0,44631403.666666664,3.0,,,,,,,,,,11193675.0,17693675.0,1.0,,,,26297787.5,48797787.5,2.0,,,,-5650813.0,4349187.0,1.0,,,,78092667.0,95092667.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,149160180.64814815,110389707.72222222,7.0,8.0,83145037.44008958

Besides the film's main plot of women ""crossing over"" to live socially as men , the opening of the film shows a scene of two male-female couples arriving noisily late at night to the hotel, but afterwards a followup scene shows that the two men had actually spent the night together in bed, with their female ""dates"" nowhere to be seen. Albert Nobbs  is a woman living as a man in order to find work in the harsh environment of 19th-century Ireland. After living as a male for thirty years, Albert, working as a hotel waiter, is known for his extreme dedication to his job, as well as for a very introverted personality. Albert has been secretly saving all his earnings to buy a tobacco shop to gain some measure of freedom and independence. Albert's steadfast focus on this is shaken by the sudden arrival of Hubert Page , a house painter hired by Mrs. Baker , the hotel owner. Albert is shocked that Hubert is to room with him while he works at the hotel. On their first night, Hubert discovers Albert's secret, but promises never to reveal it, much to Albert's relief. The next day, Hubert confesses he is also a biological woman. Hubert leaves soon after, but not before telling Albert that he has a wife named Cathleen, a dressmaker. Meanwhile, recently unemployed Joe Mackins  arrives at the hotel to repair the boiler. Flirtatious maid, Helen Dawes , is attracted to him, and they soon become lovers; Joe's controlling nature and alcoholism soon become apparent, however. Albert visits Hubert at his home and meets Cathleen . Albert tells Hubert the story of his/her life: born a bastard and raised in a convent before being kicked out after her well to do mother's death. One night, when she was fourteen, she was brutally gang raped and beaten by a group of men. Immediately afterwards, in order to to find work she hears there is a need for waiters, so she buys a suit and is hired. This is a pivotal event because she chooses to continue to work and eventually live as a man. We are never told what name she was born with -- she thinks of herself solely as ""Albert"". Believing Helen may be the ideal wife to run a shop with, Albert asks her to leave with him. Helen refuses, but Joe, believing that Albert will give Helen money that could help the pair emigrate to America, encourages Helen to lead him on. Helen agrees to be with Albert, who buys Helen expensive gifts to please her. Helen is uncomfortable with Albert and the arrangement that Joe forced her to make. Albert tells Helen he wants to buy a shop, though Helen only wants to leave Ireland for America. A typhoid epidemic has broken out in Dublin, and when some staff fall ill, customers avoid the hotel, causing financial problems. Albert becomes infected but soon recovers, while Helen discovers she is pregnant with Joe's child. Joe is terrified, fearing he will become like his abusive father. Albert goes to Hubert's home and learns that Cathleen died, devastating Hubert. As a tribute to her, Albert and Hubert don dresses Cathleen made and take a stroll on the beach. Though both at first are extremely uncomfortable, in this isolated environment, if only for a brief moment, Albert is free enough to embrace her real identity and sexuality. This is an important scene in the film for while Hubert does not identify himself as a woman, even in private, Albert is overcome with joy at finding that he is still a woman, reveling in the person who has been sublimated for so many years. But a stumble and fall brings her back to reality and she and Hubert redress as men and go back to their lives as before. Back at the hotel, Albert learns Helen is pregnant and offers to marry her. Helen refuses, sensing Albert does not love her, though Albert agrees with her fear that Joe will abandon her and the child and go to America alone. Later that evening, when Joe and Helen get into a loud fight, Albert intervenes. Albert physically attacks Joe when he attempts to hurt Helen in a fit of rage; Joe throws Albert against a wall, hitting Albert's head. Albert returns to his room, but notices that he is bleeding from one ear. He dies later that night, presumably as a result of his head injury. Mrs. Baker discovers Albert's hidden money and uses it to revitalize the hotel. In the following months, Joe has gone to America and Helen has given birth to a son, Albert Joseph. Mrs. Baker makes further use of Albert's money by hiring Hubert to paint the entire hotel. Hubert sees Helen again, who breaks down and reveals that she will be separated from her son and thrown out into the street. Hubert tells her, ""We can't let that happen, can we?"", implying that he will look after her in lieu of Albert.butler dublin maid",True,tt1602098,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,5634828,1,0,-0.4197416496120201,1.026708649479613,,,,,,,143680007.0,23,177680007.0,2.0,,0.0,,,68188903.0,1.0,96188903.0,1.0,-12316079.0,19.0,14683921.0,1.0,130742511.8,15.0,201642511.8,10.0,20192418.57142857,13.0,57549584.14285714,7.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,44785437.44444445,79118770.77777778,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,109548985.38857143,70097552.27428572,8.875,4.2,83145037.44008958

While Gal is laid back, Jay is still suffering from an unspecified disastrous mission in Kiev and, despite the urging of his wife Shel , he has not worked since and they are running out of cash. Shel organises a dinner party to which she invites Gal and his latest girlfriend, a human resources manager called Fiona , and during the evening Gal reveals he has a new job for them, which Shel encourages him to take. Meanwhile Fiona goes to the toilet, carves a symbol on the back of the bathroom mirror and takes a tissue that Jay had used to mop up his blood after a shaving accident. Jay agrees to take the gig and the two meet the shadowy client who has a list of three people he wants killed and, unexpectedly, cuts Jay's hand leading to the contract being effectively signed in blood. Their first target, a priest, appears to recognise Jay and thanks him just before being killed. The second name on the list turns out to be a maker of child pornography who also thanks Jay before he is beaten to death. While Jay chases down some of the other paedophiles, Gal looks into their files and finds a folder on himself and Jay, including details of their problems in Kiev. Staking out the final mark, a Member of Parliament, they witness a strange ceremony in the woods, including a human sacrifice. They intervene but are outnumbered and get chased into a tunnel complex where Gal is stabbed to death by one of the masked pursuers. Emerging from the tunnels Jay flees to a small country house they own where Shel and Sam had gone to hide. Once there Shel arms herself, whilst Jay goes outside to find torches lit around a nearby field, and the tires slashed on the family car. Meanwhile in the house we see someone is trying to break in to the home. Outside Jay is knocked unconscious. Once he wakes up he finds himself in the field surrounded by the masked worshippers and he is confronted by his last victim ""The Hunchback"". After a brutal knife fight Jay triumphs, only to discover that the person he was fighting was his wife with their son Sam strapped to her back. The cultists begin to clap and as they reveal themselves it is seen that The Client, Fiona, and Jay's doctor are all members of the cult. The film ends with Jay being crowned by the cultists.hotel husband wife relationship hitman infection forest cult priest murderer brutality bonfire ceremony ex soldier ritual sacrifice contract killer video tape",False,tt1788391,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,171760,1,0,-1.911038658593386,1.026708649479613,,,,,,,,0,,,-3083836.0,3.0,12916164.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12916164.0,-3083836.0,0.375,2.0,83145037.44008958

Hugh Perceval  tells Colin there are no jobs available, but he decides to wait for Olivier, whom he once met at a party. Olivier and his wife, Vivien Leigh , eventually show up and Vivien encourages Olivier to give Colin a job on his upcoming film The Prince and the Showgirl, starring Marilyn Monroe ([[Michelle Williams . Colin's first task is to find a suitable place for Marilyn and her husband, Arthur Miller , to stay at while they are in England. The press find out about the house, but Colin reveals he hired another just in case, impressing Olivier and Marilyn's publicist, Arthur Jacobs . The paparazzi find out about Marilyn's arrival at Heathrow and they gather around the plane when it lands. Marilyn brings her husband, her business partner, Milton H. Greene , and her acting coach Paula Strasberg  with her. She initially appears to be uncomfortable around the many photographers, but relaxes at the press conference. Olivier becomes frustrated when Marilyn is late to the read-through. She insists Paula sits with her and when she has trouble with her lines, Paula reads them for her. The crew and the other actors, including Sybil Thorndike , are in awe of Marilyn. Colin meets Lucy , a wardrobe assistant whom he is attracted to, and they go on a date. Marilyn starts arriving later to the set and often forgets her lines, angering Olivier. However, Sybil praises Marilyn and defends her when Olivier tries to get her to apologise for holding the shoot up. Marilyn struggles to understand her character and leaves the set when Olivier insults her. Colin asks the director to be more sympathetic towards Marilyn, before he goes to Parkside House to check on her. He hears an argument and finds a tearful Marilyn sitting on the stairs with Arthur's notebook, which contains the plot of a new play that appears to poke fun at her. Arthur later returns to the United States. Vivien comes to the set and watches some of Marilyn's scenes. She breaks down, saying Marilyn lights up the screen and if only Olivier could see himself when he watches her. Oliver tries unsuccessfully to reassure his wife. Marilyn does not show up to the set following Arthur's departure and she asks Colin to come to Parkside and they talk. The crew becomes captivated by Marilyn when she dances for a scene and Milton pulls Colin aside to tell him Marilyn breaks hearts and that she will break his too. Lucy also notices Colin's growing infatuation with Marilyn and breaks up with him. Colin and Marilyn spend the day together and are given a tour of Windsor Castle by Owen Morshead . Colin also shows Marilyn around Eton College, and they go skinny dipping in the River Thames. Marilyn kisses Colin and they are found by Roger Smith ([[Philip Jackson , Marilyn's bodyguard. Colin is called to Parkside one night as Marilyn has locked herself in her room. Colin enters her room and Marilyn invites him to lie next to her on the bed. The following night, Marilyn wakes up in pain and claims she is having a miscarriage. A doctor tends to her and Marilyn tells Colin that she wants to forget everything. She later returns to the set to complete the film. Olivier praises Marilyn, but reveals she has killed his desire to direct again. Lucy asks Colin if Marilyn broke his heart and he replies that she did, a little. Marilyn comes to Colin's B&B and thanks him for helping her. She kisses him goodbye and Roger drives her to the airport.based on novel or book jealousy prince biography tenderness historical figure celebrity blonde marilyn monroe film in film filmmaking sensuality showgirl movie star 1950s memoir",False,tt1655420,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,35057696,1,0,4.477765,1.026708649479613,102131084.5,142881084.5,9021857.866666667,23718878.166666668,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,117028675.0,22.0,152171532.14285713,7.0,,0.0,,,142483118.0,22.0,191074027.0909091,11.0,717091845.4444444,10.0,865980734.3333334,9.0,152846749.25,5.0,173161691.5,4.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,66972817.5,108222817.5,4.0,91059361.0,119684361.0,12.0,264317794.0,289317794.0,1.0,,,,,,,42820881.333333336,54820881.333333336,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,71114399.8,113814399.8,5.0,,,,-2200126.0,4199874.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,345596996.2667749,282362596.9236111,7.375,7.75,83145037.44008958

Distanced from his sister and seemingly without any close friends, he struggles with a secret sexual addiction. On a subway train he flirts with a woman and she flirts back. She has on both a wedding ring and an engagement ring, and when they exit the train, she disappears into the crowd. His company's computer system has been compromised by a virus; in the cleanup, Brandon's computer hard drive indicates an obsessive amount of surfing extreme porn sites, one of which is probably the source of the virus. Although Brandon, who is driven to masturbate in the bathroom stall at work, is responsible, it is assumed his intern is to blame. Brandon and his married boss David  meet three women at a club. Brandon has sex with one of them, the woman David was pursuing. When Brandon arrives home, he assumes a burglar is in his house, but finds a naked woman taking a shower. It is his sister Sissy . She works as a part-time singer who has a few gigs in the city, she asks to stay with Brandon; he later hears her pleading with her lover on the telephone not to reject her. The next morning, at the subway station, Sissy is balancing herself on the edge of the platform. Brandon rebukes her, and in the brief exchange that follows Sissy persuades her brother to visit her as she performs at a club—something that he avoided in the past. Later, Brandon is joined by an enthusiastic David as they watch Sissy singing a very sad jazz version of ""New York, New York"", which makes Brandon emotional. Sissy joins Brandon and David at their table, where David courts her despite Brandon's evident dismay. Sissy accepts David's advances and has sex with him in her brother's bedroom while Brandon, disgusted, leaves his apartment and goes out running. Later that night, Sissy attempts to sleep in his bed with him; enraged, he orders her out of the room. Brandon's co-worker, Marianne , flirts with him at work. On the way to dinner with her, he stops to observe a high-rise hotel, where he sees a couple having sex up against the window. The date becomes awkward as conversation steers on their affective differences: Marianne, who was recently separated, keeps a positive attitude toward commitment, while Brandon dislikes marriage and admits that his relationships have never lasted longer than four months. Brandon and Marianne part ways at the end of the night without kissing, each going home alone. Sissy arrives at Brandon's apartment and accidentally walks in on him masturbating in the bathroom. He physically attacks Sissy, accusing her of spying on him. She then finds his laptop open on a pornography webcam site; the woman on the webcam is familiar with him and assumes Sissy is his girlfriend. Brandon slams the laptop shut. Disturbed and upset, Sissy leaves. Brandon angrily throws out all of his pornographic magazines and his laptop. The next day, at work, he kisses Marianne and then takes her to the same high-rise hotel where he saw the couple having sex. In the bathroom, he snorts a line of cocaine. They attempt to have sex, but Brandon cannot maintain an erection and appears heavily distressed. Marianne leaves, after which Brandon is seen having sex with another woman against the window. He stays in the hotel room and watches the sun set. Brandon is home watching cartoons when Sissy arrives. Knowing that she is emotionally dependent and has probably called David, he tells her that he is disgusted with her and that David won't be seeing her again. He tells her she needs to leave, that he feels trapped by her. She says that they are family and are supposed to help each other, but Brandon accuses her of being nothing but a burden. Brandon then heads out to a bar, where he gropes a woman and blatantly tries to pick her up, making a variety of suggestive and provocative remarks to her. He ends up being beaten up by her boyfriend whom he has deliberately antagonised by making aggressive reference to his fantasies about her. During this sequence of the film, the chronology is not linear: we see Brandon's injury - a wound on his left cheek - before we understand how it has been caused. After he is denied entrance to a nightclub with the words ""Not tonight"", he notices a gay bar across the street and enters. He walks to the back, where several men are having sex; a man kisses Brandon and then performs fellatio on him. On leaving the bar, he listens to a voicemail message from Sissy telling him how much she needs him, and that they aren't bad people, they've just come from a bad place. He leaves once again to visit an apartment occupied by two prostitutes, where the three have sex. While Brandon is riding the subway on his way home, the passengers are asked to leave the carriage due to an implied suicide further up the tracks. He frantically calls Sissy, but she does not answer, so he rushes home. When he gets there, Sissy, who has a history of cutting herself, is lying on the bathroom floor, having slashed her wrists. She survives and he comforts her in the hospital. After leaving, he collapses and cries in the rain. Some time later, Brandon is seen sitting on a subway train and the same woman from the beginning of the film sits across from him, wearing just an engagement ring this time.

They learn that Kate's brother Andy  was smuggling drugs, but dropped them into the Mississippi River during a surprise inspection by U.S. Customs. Andy's boss, ruthless mobster Tim Briggs , threatens to kill Chris' family if Andy doesn't pay 700,000. Chris decides to raise the money by running contraband, working with his best friend and former smuggling partner, Sebastian Abney ([[Ben Foster , who has also gone legit and now owns a construction company. He promises Kate that he will not run drugs, joining the crew of a cargo ship in order to buy 10,000,000 in fake bills in Panama and smuggle them into the U.S. He is joined by Andy, good friend Danny Raymer , and gets help from fellow crew mates. Briggs breaks into Chris's house to scare his wife and kids, so they move into Sebastian's house for safety. In Panama, Chris discovers that the bills are of poor quality and refuses to accept them. The only one who can provide good ones is crime lord Gonzalo . While Chris and Danny negotiate with Gonzalo, Briggs calls Andy and threatens to kill one of Chris' sons if Andy doesn't immediately take Chris' money and use it to buy cocaine. Gonzalo lets Chris and Danny help in a dangerous armored car heist as payment for the fake bills. They are successful in stealing a paint splattered tarp in the heist, but Gonzalo and his men are killed in a firefight with the police. Chris and Danny make it back to the ship yard in a van containing the fake bills and the tarp. They load the contraband-laden van into a container which is loaded onto their cargo ship. Chris assaults Andy for stealing the money and buying cocaine. It is revealed that Sebastian has been working with Briggs, as gangster Jim Church  threatens to kill Sebastian if he doesn't repay money he borrowed to save his fledgling construction business. When Sebastian calls Chris, Chris tells him that he might drop the drugs Andy bought into the ocean. Sebastian tells Briggs, who assaults Kate and warns her to tell Chris to not dump the ""package"". Kate calls Chris and tells him what Briggs said to her. Chris is surprised that Briggs knew about dumping the drugs, realizing that Sebastian had to have told him. Kate does not know and goes back to Sebastian's apartment to retrieve some personal items. When Sebastian tries to force himself on her, Kate runs to the bathroom. Sebastian breaks the door open, sending Kate flying and bashing her head against the tub. Sebastian thinks she is dead and panics, wraps her in plastic, and throws Kate's unconscious body in a yet to be poured foundation. Sebastian contacts the cargo ship's Captain Camp , tells him that Chris is smuggling on his ship, and promises him a share if he makes sure Chris doesn't throw it overboard. When Chris does not give up the contraband, Camp calls U.S. Customs to meet the ship in New Orleans. The Customs Agents do not find anything other than the van, containing only the paint splattered tarp. Briggs and his thugs force Chris to take them to the drugs. Chris takes Briggs to Camp's house, having made a duplicate key while on the ship, and knowingly activates the security system. Chris opens Camp's personal carpet cleaner, which the Captain had aboard the ship, and retrieves the cocaine from the carpet cleaner's water tank. While Briggs and his gang sit in Camp's living room with the cocaine, Chris sneaks out in Camp's car. Camp awakens to the noise and comes into the living room as the police arrive. Both Briggs and Camp are arrested. Chris goes to Sebastian's construction site and brutally beats him, demanding Kate's location. When Sebastian tells Chris that she's dead, he tries calling her cellphone and hears the ringtone in a building foundation where cement is being poured and rescues her. Sebastian is arrested and sent to prison. Danny retrieves the fake bills, which we learn Chris had dumped into the Mississippi River before docking in New Orleans. Andy buys the escape van, still containing the tarp, at a police auction. Church pays Chris 3 million for the fake currency. and asks if he knows anything about a Jackson Pollock painting stolen from an armored car in Panama, telling him that it's worth over 20 million on the black market. Chris, Andy and Danny find the tarp/painting still in the van, having gone unnoticed.

Florence Cathcart  is a published author on supernatural hoaxes who works with the police to expose charlatans and debunk supernatural phenomena, having begun her foray into her profession upon the death of her lover in World War I. Upon a visit from Robert Malory , a teacher from a boarding school with the request to investigate the recent death of a student and how it is related to sightings of a ghost of a child, she travels to the school hoping to explain the sightings and the death. The ghostly sightings are at first thought to be a prank played by one of the boys at the school. While Florence and Robert start developing a mutual attraction, the school is closed for holidays with the only occupants being Robert, Florence, Maud  the housekeeper and Tom, a lonely orphan child. As unexplained supernatural events start to manifest, it is revealed towards the end that Tom is a ghost and is Florence's half brother and Maud's son. Florence and Tom grew up in the house that is now a boarding school. While Florence and Tom were young, their father became mad and killed Florence's mother, Tom and himself while also trying to kill Florence. Florence had blocked these memories of her childhood. Maud, who also sees Tom, explains that Tom is lonely and that he needs his family; Maud poisons herself and Florence, intending for their ghosts to join Tom. Florence, however, tells Tom that she will not be happy if she dies now and that she will always be with Tom. Tom then helps Florence by bringing her medicine to throw up the poison. There is ambiguity about whether she survives: in the closing scene, the headmaster speaks of her as if she is not there, and only a lonely child  acknowledges her. She can be seen by Malory and promises to visit him 'Saturday week' before setting off. Maud and Tom are gone, and she says though she can't see them, they are not forgotten, raising the possibility they are now at peace.suicide england classroom investigation supernatural murder children haunting teacher author fear estate con discovery ghost governess",False,tt1687901,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,209696,0,0,-21.881862314970242,1.026708649479613,9695678.285714285,25021120.214285713,-15033073.0,741875.0,,,,0,,,13492336.5,4.0,44492336.5,2.0,133308897.0,13.0,151308897.0,2.0,,0.0,,,20811672.0,4.0,37311672.0,1.0,,0.0,,,100929130.0,15.0,177929130.0,2.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41854172.0,56854172.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,-829000.0,165000.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-7788574.0,22211426.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,202380415.8,296380415.8,5.0,152973947.2857143,214259661.57142857,7.0,,,102760508.875,67135508.875,4.5,1.75,83145037.44008958

Their plight is publicized after he does a feature on them, which he hopes might be his opportunity to move up to a larger TV market. His news story draws international attention and sets into motion a massive effort to free the whales from the ice. Drawn into the collaborative rescue work are several normally hostile factions: Inupiat whale hunters, a Greenpeace environmental activist, an oil executive, ambitious news reporters, the National Guard, the American president and politicians on the state, national and international levels. Also joining in the effort are two entrepreneurs from Minnesota, who provide de-icing machines to help keep the hole open. Finally an enormous Soviet ice-breaker ship arrives to remove the last barrier before the whales.whale based on a true story alaska reporter aftercreditsstinger duringcreditsstinger greenpeace animal protection",False,tt1430615,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,24719215,1,0,-0.6181743635467388,-10.812845724436539,82256507.93548387,109809669.22580644,67844409.81818181,110089864.36363636,,,236529144.0,17,336529144.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,45868327.0,12.0,71868327.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-23060577.0,939423.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,204198735.5,141198735.5,3.625,1.0,123186632.01668148

Just before closing time he picks up Glen , an aspiring artist, and they end up sleeping together back in Russell's apartment. Russell, who works as a lifeguard, feels inferior about his job. The next day Glen and Russell meet up and the two ride Russell's bike together. Back at Russell's apartment, they spend the day together, sharing stories of their past encounters and their experiences as gay men. Russell confides to Glen how he grew up in a foster home with a friend, Jamie, whom he considered as his brother; during this time he was closeted. Russell learns that Glen is leaving for Oregon the next day for a two-year art course. This leaves Russell upset. Glen invites him to attend a party he is throwing in a bar that night. Instead of forgetting his developing relationship with Glen, Russell later goes to see him in the bar. One of Glen's friend mentions to Russell how Glen had a relationship with a guy named John, who cheated on him but became a martyr in their relationship and how he got beaten up in the park. The pair get out of the bar and spend their time in the amusement park where Glen admits that he is never happy and feels down whenever he's with his friends. When they get back to Russell's place, they smoke marijuana but it is not long before they have an argument as Glen speculates that things would be perfect for them in America, where they would have equal rights, rather than in England. Russell feels it's right to fight for their equal rights and believes they could be happy together. Russell then rebukes Glen for not breaking up with John despite knowing that John was cheating on him. Glen then strikes back at Russell telling him that he doesn't know anything about his life and that he couldn't even stand up for himself. This upsets Russell and he leaves. However, Russell and Glen are reconciled, and soon they passionately share a kiss and have sex. In the morning, they play a game where Glen pretends to be Russell's father where he could finally come out to him . After Glen leaves, Russell feels desolate and goes to attend the birthday party of his friend Jamie's daughter. Jamie asks him what is wrong and he finally admits he loves Glen and is afraid of letting him go. Jamie then drives Russell to the train station where he could catch up with the departing Glen. He gets there in time and chances upon Glen who thought he would never show up. They say their last goodbyes and Glen kisses Russell, who finally overcomes his fear of being ""out"" in public. Glen hands Russell a present, which is a voice recorder on which Glen had earlier recorded Russell's account of how they met and their first encounter.gay one-night stand independent film gay relationship nottingham gay club lgbt",False,tt1714210,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,484592,0,0,59.574,1.026708649479613,-4290845.0,17709155.0,4149342.5,8539342.5,,,,0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,83145037.44008958

At 22, as her aunt constantly reminds her, she is verging on spinsterhood. She meets her brother's best friend, Cedric Trilling , when the two come home from university. Aunt Agnes wants the two to fall in love: Cedric, however, is a pompous bore who is overly fond of quoting Homer on all sorts of not-quite-appropriate occasions; also, he's a repressed homosexual. When Emily's aunt sees the sparks failing to fly, she whisks everyone off to Italy, then India, hoping the romantic locations will bring on love. Emily's eye, however, soon wanders to the family's new manservant, George , a sturdy peasant who, earlier in the film, had the effrontery to fling off all his clothes and save her life when she was drowning in a pond. Now, Emily can't seem to forget his tall, manly frame and his ""ripping set of unmentionables."" . With George, Emily achieves carnal fulfillment, true love, and, eventually, motherhood and marriage. Although the upper-class characters disapprove of the alliance, nobody is more scandalised than George's father, who keeps reminding his son that he's ""the scum of the earth."" When Emily becomes pregnant, she suggests giving the child to George's father; George, appalled, begs her to sell it to pirates, abandon it on a mountain, or let it be raised by wolves instead. Cedric, too, finds love with Edward , Emily's handsome, cheerful twit of a brother. In that era, it was ""the love that dare not speak its name""; however, during Emily's wedding scene, Edward takes Cedric's arm and shouts ""WE LOVE EACH OTHER!"" in church. Even Aunt Agnes meets someone special - an expatriate Englishman  who owns a tea plantation in India. At the end of the film, despite class differences, sexual taboos, and age prejudice, everyone seems likely to lead happy, sexually fulfilled lives ever after.italy victorian england young woman",False,tt0120210,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,69582,0,0,-80.91773734586529,-2.5293608277783246,,,,,,,-3148455.0,3,851545.0,1.0,6640084.0,20.0,14560084.0,1.0,2522563.3333333335,15.0,9189230.0,3.0,18126837.0,6.0,26126837.0,1.0,-33326758.0,1.0,26673242.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-33326758.0,26673242.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15480187.6,-1837145.7333333334,5.625,1.4,60772021.118274406

Kusum as a child gets married to Vrindavan in a small ceremony. After some time her father dies in a riot and blame erroneously comes to Vrindavan's father. Due to this, Vrindavan's father rejects Kusum to be his daughter-in-law. Kusum along with his brother and mother, moves to different village away from Vrindavan's family. Now they grow up and Kusum (Hema Malini) considers herself as the wife of Vrindavan and rejects to marry anyone else. Eventually her mother dies and her brother Kunj (Asrani) stays single as he don't want to marry till he send his sister to in-laws. On the other side, Vrindavan's ( Jeetendra) father dies and he becomes a doctor. Oblivious to Kusum's feelings, he goes on to marry another girl Lakhi (Sharmila Tagore), who was also a victim of child marriage and has no one now. They had a son Charan (Master Raju) and Lakhi dies after some time due to illness. He moves to his own village and starts practice there. Once, he happens to visit a wealthy patient in Kusum's village where Kusum recognizes him, though he fails to as he only knows her pet name, not real name. Gradually they come closer and Vrindavan's mother is happy to accept Kusum as daughter-in-law. But misunderstandings develop because Kusum considers them insensitive as they not only forgot what they have done to her family but also takes her for granted now. But Vrindavan, having soft corner for her still wishes that she would come to him. Kusum grows close to his son Charan and keeps him with her during endemic in Vrindavan's village. Finally, Vrindavan and Kusum are able to overcome egoistic barriers and unite with the blessings of her brother, Vrindavan's mother and little Charan.

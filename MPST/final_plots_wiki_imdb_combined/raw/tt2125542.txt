Ed Migliocetti (Lou Ferrigno, "The Incredible Hulk") has served his country. When the war began, he put aside his football career to sign up for the military. And when the powers-that-be drafted him into the Enhanced Abilities Initiative, he became The Liberator.Teamed with supers Sidewinder, Gaia and Volt, Liberator represented the best of America. Or so he thought. He soon found himself doing the government's dirty work: assassinations, regime change, infrastructure sabotage. Through it all, Ed followed orders. He was a good soldier. But when a black op went horribly wrong, Ed was thrown under the bus. In the blink of an eye, the Liberator literally went from hero to zero. After serving a decade in federal prison, he emerged a pariah. In the eyes of the public, he was a traitor. That, quite frankly, he could take. What he couldn't take was his own daughter Sonya (Jessica Jade Andres) hating him.Determined to set the record straight and win her back, Ed pens a tell-all book that immediately draws the ire of his former chief General Augustus Pollard (Michael Dorn, "Star Trek: The Next Generation" ). Pollard dispatches undercover spook Marla Criswell (Peta Wilson, "La Femme Nikita") to investigate. When they realize that Ed plans to blow the whistle after all these years, they have no choice but to take him out.After Ed battles his way out of a US military contractor compound, President Whitlock (Ed Asner, "Up" ), declares the Liberator Public Enemy Number One and sends his old teammates (Don the Dragon Wilson and Tara Cardinal) to disappear him by any means necessary.But this time, the Liberator is not going down without a fight.

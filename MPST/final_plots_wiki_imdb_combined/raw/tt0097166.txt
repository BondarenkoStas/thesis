A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy is shot down on Christmas Eve when he stumbles upon a robbery-homicide at a convenience store. A down-on-his-luck L.A. County Sheriff's Dept. homicide detective, Jerry Beck (Johnson), is assigned to the case. As with every case, he takes this one very emotionally, because "the job" is the last thing left in his life, and vows to get the perpetrator no matter what.
The slain officer's widow further complicates the issue when she entices Beck into a one-night stand, in the hope that Beck will not only find but kill her husband's murderer. During the investigation Beck learns that the murder of the deputy sheriff was just the tip of the iceberg, as he finds the roots of the suspect are in a White Supremacist, Neo-Nazi group.
Detective Beck pursues the killer across several states and uncovers that the killer is involved with a White Supremacist, Neo-Nazi group that is involved in many violent crimes. Eventually Detective Beck tracks the killer to a Neo-Nazi compound in rural Colorado. Beck, with the assistance of a local police chief and his officers, corners the killer in an underground tunnel complex concealed under the neo-nazis' compound. Beck kills the suspect with his .357 Colt Python revolver in a shootout when the killer fires on Detective Beck and the local police with a 9mm Browning Hi-Power pistol.

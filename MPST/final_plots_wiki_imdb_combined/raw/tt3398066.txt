Busy ad executive Gwyneth Hayden (Lacey Chabert) has been unsuccessful in love. Seeing that a friend has become engaged leaving her as the last single woman in her group, and after seeing an advert for the dating website Christian Mingle, she signs up. She confesses to her co-worker Pam (Saidah Arrika Ekulona) that she hasn't been to church in years despite having been brought up a Christian, and before going on a date with Paul (Jonathan Patrick Moore) she buys The Bible for Dummies and Christianity for Dummies.
After a couple of successful dates, Paul takes Gwyneth to a Bible study group at his friend's house. She meets Jessy (Sascha Alexander) and Jimmy (Tony D. Czech), a couple who also met through the site, Gabby (Jessa French) and Tommy (Justin Dray), who are expecting their first child, and Kelly (Jill Saunders), a childhood friend of Paul's.
Paul asks Gwyneth to go to church and meet his parents, Lacie (Morgan Fairchild) and Bill (David Keith). After Gwyneth meets with Jessy, Jimmy, Gabby, Tommy and Kelly, Paul reveals that he will be travelling to Mexico with his father's construction company to repair a church in Mexico. Gwyneth is annoyed that she wasn't told but is persuaded to join everyone in Mexico.
She takes time off from her job but while there her copy of Christianity for Dummies is discovered and she confesses to Paul that she wasn't a practicing Christian when she signed up to the site. They break up and she returns to America. When Paul and his family returns Gwyneth goes to see him and learns that he is with Kelly.
Her boss Douglas McCarver (Stephen Tobolowsky) has Gwyneth write a campaign to sell a cure for baldness for their client Donny Da Bona (John O'Hurley), but she cannot lie due to her newly discovered faith and quits to go become a teacher at the village in Mexico.
Some months later Paul returns to the village to tell Gwyneth that he has broken up with Kelly and he proposes to her.

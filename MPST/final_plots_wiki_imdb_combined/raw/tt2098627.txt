Cassie Stratford is a plain science nerd, whose mother was captain of the cheersquad at Iron Coast University and president of Zeta Mu Sorority, so she's pressured to join both cheerleading and the sorority. However, Brittany Andrews, Zeta President and Cheer Captain (who has a Napoleon complex), rejects her.
Cassie works in the Biology Building of the University, where she and her friend Kyle are working on a drug that turns things beautiful. In the night, Cassie steals the drug and injects herself with it. While she does become beautiful and makes the cheersquad when one of the cheerleaders is injured, she then discovers the drug has a side effect when she starts to grow taller and taller until she is a 50-foot tall giant.
When Brittany discovers this, she tries to seduce Kyle into telling her the secret, which leads to her being accidentally injected with more of the drug than Cassie and growing bigger too. Brittany goes through the town on her way to the stadium, being careful not to hurt anyone on the way. She begins to cheer, but is confronted by Cassie. This all leads to a large cat fight during the big homecoming game. Cassie wins by injecting the antidote into Brittany, making her shrink into a dwarf. Cassie then injects herself with a smaller portion and returns to her normal size. She and Kyle then kiss.

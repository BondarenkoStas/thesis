The exposition to Night Trap is presented to the player by Lt. Simms of the Sega Control Attack Team (S.C.A.T.) at the start of the game. He explains that the team was alerted to the disappearance of five teenage girls who were last seen at the Martin winery estate. The Martin family consists of Victor Martin, his wife Sheila, their children Jeff and Sarah, and cousin Tony. The missing girls were reportedly invited to stay for the night. Police questioned the Martin family, but they claimed the girls had left safely and they refused to let the police search the property. The police then handed over the case to S.C.A.T. to resolve. S.C.A.T. agents investigated the house, and found a series of traps, security cameras, and a operational unit in the basement to control the apparatus. The agents spliced an override cable onto the control system and connected it to a control panel in the back hallway of the house. The player is given the role of an internal S.C.A.T. operative to control the traps and cameras from this back hallway.
Five more teenage girls head towards the estate, Kelli, Ashley, Lisa, Cindy, and Megan. S.C.A.T. was able to place agent Kelli Medd (Dana Plato) within the group as an undercover agent. The girls are not aware of her true identity. Also with the girls is Danny, Lisa's younger brother. What the gang does not know is the house is infested with Augers, vampiric beings that need blood to survive. The Martin family themselves are in the process of becoming vampires. The following events that take place and the endings vary widely depending on which characters the player is able to save from the Augers.

Jerry, a secret agent, drives through the street of a town (the buildings in the opening shot suggest Westminster, London) and enters his secret headquarters through a cigar store Indian. His mission: infiltrate the mansion of Tom Thrush and recover a refrigerator with lots of cheese. But before that, he checks all of the weapons inside his coat. But when he seals it very tight, they get activated, causing several holes on it as he comically grins at the "audience".
After the opening credits, Tom (notably with a gap in his teeth here) sets some traps for Jerry, including an exploding robot female mouse, as he drives to Tom's castle, outside of the city. These are mostly ineffective. Tom manages to make it to the safeguarded room and sets even more traps, such as blades, barbed wire and sensitive mines. Jerry plays a tape-recorder; it sounds as if he is walking through the room. Tom waits a few seconds, then says "Boom!" Not hearing the explosions that should result from the walking, Tom runs in. He is attacked by his own traps.
After that, he "helped" Jerry by opening the safe that keeps the refrigerator as he got bonkers (due to the traps that he ran over). Jerry thanks Tom by lifting his fedora up as he got the refrigerator from him. Jerry straps the refrigerator to his tiny car and Tom is crawling out the front door of his mansion, though he in a very bad way following the incident. His hand lands on the "Play" button of Jerry's tape player, and the song "Taps" starts to play. Tom grabs a flower and lays it on his chest, indicating that he is dying from the incident. The words "THE END" are seen on Jerry's number plate ("JERRY-AKIN 00 1/7", a pun on both Illya Kuryakin and James Bond) before Jerry drives off.

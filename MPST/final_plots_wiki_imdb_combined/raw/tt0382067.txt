Bugs is living in his rabbit hole that is just outside of Las Vegas, when Yosemite Sam builds a casino over it. Being given the option to gamble or get out, Bugs tries his luck. At every game he plays (blackjack, roulette, slots) he doesn't lose, much to Sam's consternation. By the time he leaves with a sum total of $8,042,123,297.55, Sam is down to his last quarter. After reprimanding a group of cheaters, he notices that lucky medals, four leaf clovers, horse shoes, or rabbit's feet are not allowed, and realizes that he's been duped.
Bugs has meanwhile used his newfound riches to buy a luxury hotel suite. Sam follows him shooting and Bugs is forced to win a prize car to outrace him; Sam, meanwhile, drives a giant boat, complete with cannons. The two race out of Las Vegas and eventually make it to the Hoover Dam. There is a conveniently placed slot machine, which Sam uses his last quarter to play. He "wins", but the screen reads H2O, causing the dam to burst.
Sam phones Bugs, who is atop the now empty dam, to tell him, "I hate you, rabbit." Porky ends the film with his usual "That's all folks!"

Gary needs a vacation from his rock-star career. Sheila is the beautiful nurse he takes along. A super-modern huge redwood, concrete, and glass home is the stage. A home that has a mind all to its own. It can see, hear, and make anything happen. You won't be able to move from your seat from fear that the supernatural effects could be real. Filmed entirely on location in Rancho Santa Fe California and at universal studios; this 1981 NBC movie of the week is a must see. Very rare and difficult to find. Doesn't that make it even better?!!

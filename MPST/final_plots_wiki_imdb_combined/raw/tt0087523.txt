A group of gorgeous American models take a long trip to South America, to participate in a photo session on a location deep in the jungle, apparently somewhere around Peruvian tropical forest. While flying over a cocaine plantation, their plane is shot down by Cesar, a dangerous drug lord, and the girls are taken prisoner by his army. Cesar suspects that an undercover police officer is among the models (in fact, one of the women actually is a special agent), so he orders his mercenaries to drag the girls into his dungeon for interrogation. After being tortured by Angel, Cesar’s sister, and cruelly gang-raped by all soldiers, the models are imprisoned in an underground cell to await Cesar's decision whether to execute them or keep them as slaves for his soldiers' “entertainment”. With the help of an old female servant, the models manage to escape from the basement jail and get some guns. As they make their way toward freedom, they run into a high-level Mafia meeting there in Cesar’s manor. A final gunfight breaks out as the women fight to take revenge and escape alive.
The movie follows the line of sexploitation films (with a mix of Women in prison film and rape and revenge films), being a low-budget production with some nudity and rough sexual-violence. In fact, it contains a large rape scene, showing the defenseless girls tied by the wrists to the dungeon’s ceiling and fences and being sadistically stripped, groped and abused by dozens of soldiers. Precisely, this strong scene made the film rated R and, consequently, couldn’t aim to a mass audience. On later releases and in the edited for T.V. version, this scene has been deleted, to allow for a wider audience.

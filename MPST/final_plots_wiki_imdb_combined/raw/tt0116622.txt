The film starts with the two detectives, Larry and David, in search of a missing singer in an abandoned trailer park. After getting shot at twice, David is saved by his cell phone, which took the bullet that was aimed for his heart. David kills the kidnapper. Then a man, Kevin, comes for the singer, tells the detective that he is going to take her on a yacht for a few days. The duo cops finagle an invitation on the yacht, as the man is a suspect of other crimes, but their boss has nothing on him.
The detectives take their wives with them on the yacht, and say that it is a vacation. While on the yacht, David gets a call from his boss saying that the kidnapper had a picture of him sitting beside their Kevin. His wife, Lori, comes out and has an argument with David because he really is not paying attention to her. He asked Kevin about the photo, but he just blew him off as the guy was just someone trying to get close to the glitz and glamor.
In Lori's room, she is there with the wife of the other cop, Sue, and they talk about Jesus and how he can give peace, and Lori states that she wants that. She then asks God into her life and becomes saved. The next day, she is upbeat and when their friends go to visit an island, they stay behind because Lori has other plans, which include them going on a secluded island where she tells him she loves him. He asks what has gotten into her and she says "that is for her to know and him to find out." He says that he wants to rest after their picnic, so she says she wants to go get some seashells. He closes his eyes and when he wakes up she and Larry and Sue have disappeared...

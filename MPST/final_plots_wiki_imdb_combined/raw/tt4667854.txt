One week before his wedding day, Jonah and his groomsmen hit the town for a wild night of club hopping and debauchery. But the party becomes a savage fight for survival when they unwittingly unleash a fabled predator upon the festivities.
Jonah tries to figure out a way to save his friend Rand, who was kidnapped and tortured by the sadistic Mr. Nyx, a former carnival owner turned necromancer. The girl, Lily, is actually a demon from hell known as a Siren that was summoned years ago, taken by Nyx, and forced to become a sex slave. Jonah tries to tell Lily he made a mistake not knowing what she was. Lily becomes infatuated with him and wants him to stay with her, killing anyone who gets in her way.
Jonah makes a deal with Nyx that Lily will follow him to a church where she was summoned years earlier. Jonah is happy to see Rand alive and well, while Nyx plans to send Lily back to hell, deeming her too dangerous to anyone around her.
However, Lily gets the upper hand and kills Nyx and his henchman, saving Jonah and Rand. She kisses Jonah goodbye, and decides to stay in the church for the rest of her life. A month later, Jonah and his wife Eva get married. They both make love on their honeymoon. Jonah decides to get himself a glass of wine, until he realized that he had made love to Lily and not Eva, who is asleep on the couch. Eva notices Lily and starts to scream, where Lily starts to attack her. Jonah begs her to stop and decides to go with her, while Eva starts to scream for Jonah, who disappears into the night.

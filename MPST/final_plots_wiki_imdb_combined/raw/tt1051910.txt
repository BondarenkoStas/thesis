Charged with the protection of Dodi and Diana whilst in Paris, he has a formidable task just to keep up with the whereabouts of the secretive couple, let alone offer them any protection. Run ragged by the couples constant change of plans, Silvestre finally gives into Rachels offer of help and allows her past the swarming paparazzi at The Ritz hotel as an extra pair of eyes and ears. There Rachel notices a number of curiosities.At approximately 12:25am the Mercedes 280S, in which Princess Diana and her boyfriend were travelling, crashes in the Alma tunnel killing Dodi and the driver, Henri Paul, outright.

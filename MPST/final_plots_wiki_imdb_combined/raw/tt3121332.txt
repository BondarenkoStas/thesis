The film centers on European-looking, South American immigrants, Freddy and Mo, a gay couple trying to have a baby with the help of their friend Polly. Freddy is also a performance artist who is attempting to make a short film entitled Nasty Baby which features himself portraying a screaming infant. Freddy's sperm count is too low causing every attempt with Polly to fail. Mo is reluctant to be the donor but eventually concedes, and Polly successfully gets pregnant. Throughout the film the trio are plagued by a mentally ill vagrant called The Bishop. Polly and Freddy make the mistake of initially being friendly to him, but he is aggressively homophobic and gives Polly unwanted attention. One evening he assaults Polly, and the next morning a policewoman intervenes. This only worsens the situation, and ultimately The Bishop follows Freddy home the same evening his performance art piece is rejected. The Bishop assaults Freddy with a rock while verbally attacking him with homophobic slurs, and in self-defense Freddy swings a six pack of beer at The Bishop's head, badly wounding him. Freddy carries The Bishop up the stairs of his apartment, remorseful and wanting to help, but The Bishop attacks Freddy with a kitchen knife and Freddy kills him in self-defense. Realizing Freddy could be deported because of this, and with Polly pregnant, the trio (with the help of several other friends) take the body to the woods and burn it.

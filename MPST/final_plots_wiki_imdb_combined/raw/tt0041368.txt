Thelma Jordon shows up late one night in the office of married assistant district attorney Cleve Marshall with a story about prowlers and burglars. Before Cleve can stop himself, he and Thelma are involved in a love affair. But Thelma is a mysterious woman, and Cleve can't help wondering if she is hiding something.
When her rich Aunt Vera is found shot, Jordon calls not the police but Marshall, who helps her cover up evidence that may incriminate her. When she emerges as the prime suspect, Marshall sabotages the prosecution. Thelma Jordon is acquitted. Her past, however, has begun to catch up with her.
Jordon acknowledges that there is a relationship with Tony Laredo, who conceived the scheme for her to commit murder and inherit Vera's jewels and money. Unable to deal with her guilty conscience, Jordon causes a car accident that results in her accomplice's death and her own injury. As she lies dying herself, Jordon confesses the truth to the district attorney. She does not incriminate Marshall, who nevertheless tenders his resignation.

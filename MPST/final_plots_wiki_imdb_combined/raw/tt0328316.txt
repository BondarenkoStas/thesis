In the 1970s, in Rio de Janeiro, the neighborhood of Barra da Tijuca was a kind of promised land. One of several buildings on the site was the Paradise Condominium, a luxury building that would be constructed by the contractor of Dr. Sabóia (José Wilker). Celio, still a child, is impressed with the model of the enterprise, shown by his friend Otávio, son of Dr. Sabóia. With the excitement of the son, his parents decide to buy an apartment in Paradise Condominium, the number 808.
However, despite having paid all the benefits for years, the family of Celio would never occupied the apartment again. This is because Dr. Sabóia, after selling the same apartment several times, bankruptcy and left the work incomplete. Fifteen years later, the workers who worked in the construction of the building created a slum beside the Paradise Condominium, and decided to take possession of the apartments and organize a peaceful invasion. With the real estate scandal coming public, Dr. Sabóia committed suicide and left the business in the hands of Otávio (Miguel Falabella). Celio (Pedro Cardoso), working as a reporter, is assigned to cover the case and thus is forced to reconnect with Otávio. Obsessed with the apartment, Célio accepts the proposal of Otávio of being his stooge, in return for $ 5 million.
The situation is beyond control, causing Célio to repent the business he've done with Otávio. Desperate and looking for God, Célio ends up finding it. That's when he receives a mission which will also be his salvation: persuade Otávio to give his entire fortune to the poor.

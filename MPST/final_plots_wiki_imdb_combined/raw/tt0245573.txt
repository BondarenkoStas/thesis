Two college students, Sam (Maya Stange) and Thea (Kathleen Robertson), meet Coles (Mark Ruffalo), an animator, at a party, and their mutual attraction leads to a passionate and awkward night together. They form an unstable friendship, and continue to push their sexual boundaries. Soon, their friendships are tested by Sam and Coles' romance and Thea's increasingly reckless behavior. Inevitably, their relationships dissolve due to fear, resentment and mistrust on all sides.
Eight years later, they reunite. Coles, now an animator for a high-profile ad agency, lives with Claire (Petra Wright), his girlfriend of five years. Thea, the former wild-child is happily married to Miles (David Thornton), with whom she shares ownership of a very successful and flourishing restaurant. Sam has returned to Manhattan from London after breaking off her engagement. Upon reconnecting, the three are drawn back into their old and complicated dynamic. They are soon forced to confront the true meaning of commitment and love, something they avoided as young adults.

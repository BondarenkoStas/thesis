This psychological thriller tells the story of Jeff Cohalan (Young). He is a successful architect who is tormented because his fianc√©e, Vivian Sheppard, was killed in a mysterious car accident on the night before their wedding. Blaming himself for her death, Cohalan spends his time alone, lamenting in the state-of-the-art cliff-top home he had designed for his bride-to-be.
Cohalan also notices that ever since the accident, he seems to be followed by bad luck. His horse and dog turn up dead without explanation, leading him to wonder if he has been cursed.
He meets a woman named Ellen (Drake), and they are immediately attracted to each other. She soon learns about Jeff's past and begins to suspect that Jeff may be much more in danger than he himself realizes.
Turns out his would have been father-in-law and partner in architecture, Ben Sheppard, was trying to destroy him. He held Jeff responsible for the death of his daughter. But the driver of the car was a married man, with whom Vivian was having an affair. Ben himself had a wife run away from him, and has a psychotic break when confronted with the truth behind why his daughter was in a car crash. Thinking Ellen is Vivian, and angry at his wife's running off, Ben shoots at Vivian/Ellen. Jeff gets hit in the shoulder protecting Ellen. It all ends well, with Jeff and Ellen getting together.

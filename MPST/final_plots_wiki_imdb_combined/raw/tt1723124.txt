Four young offenders: Tim, Sam, Dwight, Zeb and their caretakers: Kate and Jeff travel to a Yorkshirian village called Mortlake to do community service, staying in a little cottage. On their first day they decide to have a drink at the local pub where they meet Jim: the bartender. The next day they go salvage abandoned trains where Tim and Sam are attacked by 3 inbreds. Jeff tries to scare them away but falls on a metal shard, cutting open his femoral artery.
They go back to the pub to get help, but Jim chops Jeff's head off with a cleaver and trap the others in the cellar. The inbreds take Zeb away and pin him to the ground in a barn. It turns out he's being used for a show for the Mortlakers. They bring in a horse and have it walk around Zeb while the others pick the lock off the cellar door and escape. The horse then crushes Zeb's head killing him. The others escape but Dwight gets recaptured and used for another show. Dwight gets tied to a chair and has fecal matter pumped inside his body, popping his eyes and blowing up his stomach. The others get back to the cottage where they're staying.
Kate goes to check the shed but when she opens the door Jim is there. She locks the door but he shoots the lock and her fingers off. Later, Kate runs outside to distract them and save Tim and Sam. She tries to run away but hits a beartrap, one of the inbreds then saws her leg off. She tries to crawl away but Jim shoots her dead. Tim checks the basement and finds a lot of booze, he tries to lure the inbreds down into the basement while Sam runs away. The inbreds go down and find Tim holding a molotov cocktail. He tries to light it but Jim tells him that the alcohol isn't strong enough to burn and they kill him. When they find Sam running away outside they bet on how she'll die, she steps on a landmine and tries not to move, but a ferret crawls up her pant leg and makes her move, blowing her up.
The film ends with the inbreds walking back to the pub for a pint

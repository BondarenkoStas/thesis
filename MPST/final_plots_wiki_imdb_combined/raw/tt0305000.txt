Skeeter Bronson is a hotel leader who is promised as a child by his father Marty to be the manager of the family hotel, but later it is bought by chain Nottingham Hotels. 25 years later, the new manager Mr. Nottingham plans to build a new hotel and appoints another man, the snotty Kendall to become the manager, because he is dating his daughter.
Skeeter's sister Wendy asks him to watch her kids, because the school at which she is the principal is being closed and she is looking for a job in Arizona. The first night, Skeeter tells a bedtime story taking place in medieval times, with some additions from her kids. It comes true. Mr. Nottingham gives Skeeter a shot at the manager position when he says his new hotel theme was taken by Hard Rock Hotel and on his way home it rains gumballs, all from the story.

The night after that, out on a campfire, he tells them about a Greek stunt man, and he ends up falling for his sister's friend and fellow colleague Jill.
The last night, he tells them about a space fight in which he triumphs over Kendall. After he wins the gig of manager he unfortunately makes the discovery,that the new Nottingham Hotel will be at the location of the closing school . After being fired, which turned out to be the connection with the ending of the space story, he gets the hotel moved to Santa Monica, and then with Jill is able to end the demolition, saving the school and his nephew and niece while getting his wallet and money back.

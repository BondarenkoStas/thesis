Suddenly, while running, Raja finds him in front and accidentally stabs him with that knife which Verma was holding. Raja, runs from there and gets hide out to some other place.
Next day, everyone is shocked by Verma's murder. Inspector Chauhan starts taking fingerprints of everybody in the college. Raja, terrified of his crime and the fact that he turned out just like his father, gives unclear fingerprints. Gullu makes him realize that by doing this, he has actually incriminated himself. On that day was Priya's birthday party where Raja and his friends were invited. Priya's nephew (and Chauhan's son) pointed out towards Raja as the murderer of Verma. Soon, Inspector Vijay realises that his son was the main eye witness of Verma's murder Vijay's son saw it through the window. When Raja learns that the murder was committed in front of Priya's home and that Priya's nephew (and Chauhan's son) has suddenly become silent since the day of murder, he realizes that Priya's nephew has seen him. Next day someone tries to (what ??) Vijay's son but soon Vijay comes and the killer runs away. Inspector Vijay confirms it ot be Raja and provides security guards to his house.
On the other hand, Inspector Chauhan finds out why the girls were murdered on the basis of a sex scandal. Raja is immediately branded as a blue film maker. To make matters worse, Raja runs away to another place with his mother not knowing the fact. On the other hand, Chauhan frees Watchman Badruddin
Chauhan eventually arrests Raja and interrogates him. Raja tells the truth, but is shocked to learn that the Professor was stabbed 20 times. He realizes that the Professor was killed by someone else and is still on the loose, tying up all leads. Realizing that Chauhan's son is in danger, he escapes from the police station and kidnaps Chauhan's son from the hospital. When Raja asks him why he told a lie, Chauhan's son says he did not. Just then, the real killer comes to kill Chauhan's son. Raja is shocked to see that the killer is Deepak.
Deepak says that he and Verma were involved in blue film making. The victims were killed because they were threatening to expose Deepak. When Verma was stabbed by Raja, Deepak saw an opportunity to eliminate his partner and make his side safe. Then he saw Chauhan's son and knew that he had another problem. Deepak killed every person who knew his secret, as incriminating Raja was his only option. The reason Chauhan's son pointed to Raja as the killer was that Deepak was standing behind him!
Deepak tries to kill Chauhan's son, but Raja fights him on the hospital roof. Deepak dies when Inspector Chauhan arrives on the scene and shoots Deepak, who falls to his death. Chauhan lets Raja go, telling him that his mother is in hospital in a critical state. Raja succeeds in saving his mother and the statement of Inspector Chauhan proves his innocence.

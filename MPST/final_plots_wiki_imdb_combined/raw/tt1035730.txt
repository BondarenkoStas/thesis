CONTAINS SPOLIERS This is a real diary from a real woman. The woman cast in this film is too young too play the real woman. The diary was written by a woman in the basement of her bombed out building during the invasion of Berlin by The Red Army in the last months of WWII. It details the way German women survived the rapes the Red Army officers felt they deserved in victory. Anonymous uses one soldier to her advantage and essentially considers him her lover not her rapist. Her real fiancé returns from the front only to spurn her for being raped. The inginuity of the survival techniques used by the Berliners of this time round out Anon's tale. The diary should be read by every priveleged person, man or woman. Americans especially. War is no place for socialites.Regarding the age of the author vs. the actress; the author was 34 when writing the diary. Nina Hoss 33 at the time of filming. Great book.
In this movie appears Juliane Köhler who will later play the role of Clara, Fritz Shimon Haber's wife in Haber.

Van Wilder (Jonathan Bennett) has graduated from high school. He is supposed to go on a road trip to Amsterdam with his dad (Linden Ashby), but his dad is busy with work, so Van goes alone. Van ends up going to Coolidge College, following family tradition. His family has their name on a building there, Wilder Hall. However, when he gets there, Coolidge is no longer the laid-back school of his dad's time, but a military-based institution run by Dean Reardon (Kurt Fuller).
Reardon, a military man who despises the senior Wilder, wants to take out his aggression on Van. He cannot force him out because his dad is wealthy and has ties to the school, so he tries to make Van's life a living hell. Van turns a one bedroom dorm into a two bedroom (by breaking down a wall). His roommate is Farley (Nestor Aaron Absera), a pothead from Jamaica. The boys decide to throw a party on campus, which is againt the rules, along with kissing, drugs, alcohol, sex, or anything else that is 'fun'. The only person to show up to the party is Yu Dum Fok (Jerry Shea). The boys try to find the girls, but instead find a group of religious, prudish girls led by Eve (Meredith Giangrande).
After Eve throws sacramental wine on them, Van pulls a prank during church. Reardon knows Van is behind the prank, so he commands his ROTC students, Dirk (Steve Talley) and his closeted sidekick Corporal Benedict (Nick Nicotera), on Van, trying to make him crack. Van falls for Dirk's girlfriend, Kaitlin (Kristin Cavallari), causing Dirk to get even more angry. Kaitlin thinks, lives, and breathes the military, and believes in chastity before marriage. After playing a military game with Reardon that results in him stepping down as dean and being tasered, Van and Kaitlin end up together and Van decides to finish college. The film ends as Van leaves Dirk and Benedict tied to each other in their underwear.

Sayid Nassif leads a group of terrorists in the Philippines. They carry out attacks and other illegal operations to obtain TNT and radioactive caesium-137. The terrorists have the ingredients for a "dirty bomb", which they plan to use to kill delegates at the first Asean Counter-Terrorism Council meeting, in Manila.
At Camp Navarro, a U.S. Marine military base in Mindanao, a rapid deployment force led by Captain Max Randall receives orders from General Hank Wallace to go after the terrorists. The general's daughter (and Randall's girlfriend), Jenna Wallace, works for the security contractor providing security at the Manila conference. Her security and technical skills place her on the Marine operation.
Nassif is collaborating with a local revolutionary, Abdul Malik, son of the 2004 U.S. Embassy bomber Omar Malik. The Marines attack a warehouse where the terrorist and revolutionary groups are meeting. While Sergeant McCray is able to blow up a truck with some of the leaders inside, some civilians are killed by friendly fire, with the act caught on a civilian's camera. Subsequently, Randall is ordered to stand down his unit.
Intent on seeking revenge for their dead in the warehouse attack, the terrorists attempt to abduct Randall, instead capturing Jenna, who is held for a $5 million ransom. General Wallace wants to pay the ransom, but Randall is given a new set of orders to go into the Philippines jungle to track down the terrorists and bring back Jenna. Jenna is freed, but Randall is captured. The Marines also learn that the terrorists are trying to establish a satellite feed to set off their dirty bomb. With the assistance of a U.S. Marine task force flying F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters, Jenna and the Marines storm the terrorist headquarters. Finally cornered, the terrorists are killed.

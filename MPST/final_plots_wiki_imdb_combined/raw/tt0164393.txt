The film begins with a voice-over by "Barek" who refers to a pagan legend. According to the saga Odin was spurned by Brunhilda. The irate pagan god chained her to an altar in Asgard, surrounded by a ring of eternal fire. He decreed that only a pure-hearted man could overcome the supernatural flames and save the alluring valkyrie. Her saviour's fate should then be connected to hers forever. As Barek explains, he and his only brother learned about this as little boys and craved more and more to rescue the legendary beauty as they grew older.
As it is later on successively revealed by flashbacks, Boar eventually couldn't resist anymore and entered the ring of fire. Hereby he suffered severe burns. Barek followed him into the fire and remained wondrously unharmed. He unchained the valkyrie and persuaded her to save Boar's life. Unfortunately her bite turned Boar into a cannibalic Berserker.
When their father, Viking leader Thorsson is in need of reinforcements because he is in war with the "Army of the Nord", he joins an alliance with the Berserkers who are now led by Boar. Following their combined campaign they fight each other. Thorsson uses fire against the otherwise immortal Berserker Boar. Barek cannot bear see his brother burning and calls Odin for help. Odin complies with Barek's request but from now the fates of Barek, Boar and Brunhilda are interlinked by a timeless curse.

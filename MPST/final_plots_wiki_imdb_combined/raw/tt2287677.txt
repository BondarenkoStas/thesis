Cangaço (Francisco Gaspar), a mistrustful clown with his face and hands covered in blood, is being held inside a dark room in the Police Station of a small town. Moreira (Paulo Vespúcio) is the investigator who caught him trying to leave the mansion near the woods, where a group of young people were found murdered. The arrested man applied petty thefts in the city, along with his partner 8-Ball (Fernando de Paula), and he is the sole suspect of the hideous crime. Although the detective does what he can to arrest the clown, no solid proof comes into sight.
The youngsters, who decided to rent a house in the country looking for some fun over the long weekend, were completely unaware of the horrors that awaited them. While man-eater Lena (Bia Gallo) tries her best to seduce the timid Théo (Leonardo Miggiorin), womanizer Beto (Rafael Raposo) annoys the girls with his cheesy pickup lines aiming to score. Their weekend is filled with music, games and flirt. Lena keeps trying to get Théo's attention and Beto makes his move onto Mari (Larissa Queiroz), while their flabby friend Vanessa (Olívia de Brito) is always left aside.
In the deep forest, not far from the rented mansion, a small shed filled with wild boars is home of a sadistic family that feeds the animals with human flesh. Jonas (Beto Brito), a truculent and demented over-sized man, is the brutal killing hand of his equally insane siblings.
The kid's darkest hour approaches as the night falls and the mischievous clowns trespass the house. Vanessa goes missing and when their friends go searching for her, what they find is nothing but ruthless violence and death.In a mysterious plot where nothing is what it seems, "Condado Macabro" plays a tribute to the slasher movies of the 70's and 80's that we love, with all the gore and nonsense humor of its genre.

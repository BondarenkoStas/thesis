Charas (marijuana) is being forested in large quantities in north India. A young British botany student, Sam Higgins (Adam Bedi), is missing for 18 months after wandering these jungles. He was on an independent study of ayurvedic herbs. On the urge of his parents, a London based policeman of Indian descent, Dev Anand (Jimmy Shergill), is sent to locate him. Upon arrival in Delhi, he enlists a tour guide, Ashraf (Uday Chopra), to search the area. He does not know that Ashraf is an undercover policeman, sent by the British and Indian ministers that profit from the marijuana trade. Ashraf does not know that the dreaded drug lord they will encounter is his former police chief, Ranbhir Singh Rathore (Irrfan Khan). The area they enter is full of mistrust, foreigners reign and Indians are viewed as suspicious journalists and police. Everyone they meet is somehow involved in the mystery. This is based on a true story.

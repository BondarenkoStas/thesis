Song Qi is a young woman with a sad past, having been orphaned in tragic circumstances. Her father was lost at sea when she was a child; years later, she witnessed the murder of her mother.Currently, Song Qi lives in Beijing, where she works for a plastic surgeon doing computerized facial reconstructions. Her boyfriend, Liu Dong, is a surgeon who works at the same medical clinic.
After finding Zhou Xiao Xi , her best friend, is having an affair with Liu Dong, Song Qi confronts her, a fight occurs, and Xiao Xi is accidentally strangled. Song Qis life is once again catapulted into tragedy and uncertainty. While initially covering up the murder and denying involvement in Xiao Xis disappearance, circumstances cause Song Qi to acknowledge her complicity in the crime. In her subsequent confession to the police, Song Qi s account of the murder is brought into question by the authorities as her confession and subsequent investigation uncover evidence that points to a different reality than that recounted by Song Qi. Song Qi admits to where she buried her friend, but rather than a body, the police unearth a book that appears to have been buried years before. Through passages written in the book, a dual, but forgotten, period of Song Qis past emerges that confuses the boundaries between what is real what is constructed in the imagination. The uncovered truth necessitate an understanding of parallel narratives in Song Qis life, opening the possibility of a future that could not have been foreseen, but one that offers the release from a past that has imprisoned Song Qi in dark passages of memories; actual, false and constructed.

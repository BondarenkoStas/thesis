In New Orleans, Louisiana, a man named John arrives at a bar searching for the "evilest" prostitute he can take home. He is directed to Shirley, who agrees to leave with him for two-hundred dollars. At his home, he asks her to lie on a table. She undresses, and John re-enters the room in a robe and wearing a mysterious metal mask. He begins massaging her, and then ties her to the table and eviscerates her, removes her heart, and offers it on an altar in a Peruvian ritual.
Sergeant Frank Hebert and his partner are assigned to Shirley's murder case after her body is found on train tracks in the city. When questioning other local prostitutes, Hebert meets Sherry, and discovers from her that the man whom Shirley had left with the night she died wore an unusual gold ring.
Meanwhile, John continues to stalk local strip clubs and bars for further female victims, performing the same evisceration and sacrificial murders on them. Hebert eventually comes upon a delivery man who helps lead police to the apartment belonging to John, where he has three women held hostage for a ritual sacrifice planned for the Mardi Gras celebration.
The police raid the apartment and save the three women, but John escapes on foot, finds a car, and begins a high-speed chase that ends with him crashing in the Gulf of Mexico. When they pull the car from the Gulf, they find the ritual mask, but John is nowhere to be found.

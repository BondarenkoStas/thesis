In 1947 Los Angeles, veteran detective Mac Foster (Kevin Kilner) talks with his younger partner Jake Sullivan (Reid Scott) about the disappearance of three men near a rock overlooking a beach. Mac mentions that the three had no connection to one another, except that they were all divorced. Mac mentions there was a witness to the last disappearance who had described supernatural goings-on.
At Mac's behest, Jake driving to the scene. On the way, it begins to rain, and he spots a woman (Elyse Levesque) in his back seat through his rearview mirror. He turns to check, but the car is empty. Later, Mac finds Jake's car, abandoned, near the rock. The weather again gets suddenly worse. Mac wanders from the car and across the beach to a cave built into the rock.
Inside the cave is a ventriloquist's dummy, a clock whose numbers appear to rotate, a stained-glass window, and footage of Mac projected onto the wall. He then comes across the three missing men, as well as Jake, standing as though mannequins. The woman appears again, behind Mac, as the film ends.

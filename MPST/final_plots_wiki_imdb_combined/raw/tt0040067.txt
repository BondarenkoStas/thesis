Nasik-based Heerendra Dhaan (Ajay Devgan) and Raj Ranade (Prashant Raj Sachdev) are bodyguards of a politician but, after their employer is implicated in a scam, they end up assaulting a police officer and flee to Mumbai. Once there they meet with Rambhabhai (Rajpal Yadav), who in turn, gets them employed with a gangster named Shambhu. After a short while the duo are apprehended by Police Inspector Narsimha, questioned, and after they agree to cooperate to bring down Shambhu, are let go. The two succeed in assisting the police arrest Shambhu, but they themselves are arrested, tried in Court, and sentenced to a year in jail.
After their discharge they are again met by Inspector Narsimha (Mohanlal), who, this time, wants to recruit them to capture and kill dreaded bandit Babban Singh (Amitabh Bachchan), who had slaughtered his wife, Kavita (Suchitra Krishnamoorthi), and son, Subbu (J.D. Chakravarthy), as well as cut his fingers off. Heerendra and Raj agree to carry out this task for 8 Lakh Rupees. They re-locate to Kaliganj where Heerendra falls in love with auto-rickshaw driver, Ghungroo (Priyanka Kothari), while Raj gives his heart to Subbu's widow, Durga (Sushmita Sen). They then set out to capture Babban and meet with some success during Diwali, but Babban manages to escape. Babban then starts to ambush and kill Kaliganj residents to compel them to surrender the duo to him. The question remains will the residents carry out Babban's wishes or will they permit themselves to be slaughtered?

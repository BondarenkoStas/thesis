After defeating the Tiktiks in Pulupandan, Makoy returns to Manila, along with Sonia, Nestor, and other survivors of the fight. But along the way, Kubots (hairy bat-like creatures) ambush their jeep and kill Sonia, an act of retribution to avenge the death of the Tiktiks. Makoy also loses an arm in the accident. 2 years later,Makoy (with a prosthetic arm and has a son) and Nestor, nowhere to go and no one to live with, lives in Manila with the now-hopeless Makoy. But hope is still there.
An American-grown Aswang uses his hotdog business as a front to multiply his minions,kills elder Aswangs after the elders disagree to the former's offering of merger. The Kubots have no choice but to seek Makoy's help. The victims became minions by eating the hotdogs,infected by a virus that transforms them into Aswang. The Aswangs attacks the police station,killing policemen and prisoners alike,leaving Makoy,Nestor and 2 policemen (Bogart the Explorer and Ramon Bautista). The policemen repels the attack,imprisoning an Aswang (Jun Sabayton) in the process.
The policemen duo investigates by themselves,while Makoy and Nestor,along with the other Aswangs,Kubots and Ghouls try to fight the cause of the plague. Makoy kills the leader when he cuts the Aswang leader's tongue and impaling him with a stake.
Moments later,Makoy and Nestor brings a puppy for his son (but revealed to be an Aswang when the puppy they gave whimpers and eaten by his son). In the wake of the leader,a grieving mother is being consoled by an Aswang (Marian Rivera),promising revenge on her by killing Makoy.

On July 13, 2027, FizzCo releases its new energy drink, OverCharge Delirium XT (also known as OCD), exclusively in Sunset City. In an attempt to sell OCD faster, FizzCo skipped health regulation protocols, in turn causing anyone who drinks it to turn into a violent boil-bodied mutant known as an Overcharge Drinker (OD). In order to cover up the deception, FizzCo claims that a virus has broken out and quarantines the whole city, preventing anyone from entering or exiting. The player, a FizzCo employee who works in the sanitation division, is saved from an attacking OD by Walter, a fellow survivor; the player is unaffected by the drink, as they were not allowed to attend the launch party for OCD, later referred to as "Horror Night".
Upon learning that Walter is creating a plane to escape the quarantine, the player obtains the aid of Sam and the Oxfords, a group of rich but lazy geniuses. After multiple errands, the Oxfords build a propeller to complete the plane. The player joins Walter in his plane to escape the city and reveal the truth about the outbreak. At the last second, Walter notices an invisible wall preventing their escape and pushes the player out of the plane before dying in the subsequent crash.
Still planning to escape, the player aids Troop Bushido, scouts living in a samurai museum, and the Fargarths, a group of larpers. In thanks, the two groups design and build a ship out of garbage which tricks the FizzCo sensors and allow them past. As the player is about to escape, they learn that FizzCo robots are attacking the Oxfords and Troop Bushido in order to kill all witnesses. The player returns to Sunset City and rescues the survivors. Sam informs the player that there is a deadly superweapon in FizzCo headquarters, which the player is able to break into after obtaining the help of Las Catrinas, a trio of cheerleaders caring for the children's ward of a hospital, by recruiting a band fronted by King Buzzo (voiced and mocapped by the real Melvins singer) to perform for the children.
The player rallies the four factions to attack FizzCo headquarters, and attempts to destroy FizzCo HQ by riding a giant bottle of OCD into it (reminiscent of Dr. Strangelove). The player is killed in the blast, and the factions mourn them. However, the player stops the credits rolling after this scene to complain how depressing the ending is, and decides to change it. The player survives in this ending, and it is revealed that the FizzCo building is a robot that is meant to destroy the city to cover up the OCD outbreak. The player destroys the robot and has milk and crackers with the other survivors. After the credits, however, computers in the FizzCo headquarters automatically activate a protocol sending FizzCo helicopters full of OCD around the world.

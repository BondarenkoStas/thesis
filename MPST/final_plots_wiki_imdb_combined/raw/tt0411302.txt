The depths of insanity are explored by a man chasing something in his apartment with a shoe.
The man attempts to catch the object that is moving around the floor of his apartment. The object appears to be a pair of fast moving boxer shorts. He makes several attempts to catch it and fails. He finally succeeds, lifting the boxer shorts off of the object. He reveals a miniature version of himself looking up fearfully as he lifts his shoe to crush the miniature. Grinning, he squashes the miniature with his shoe. As he grins, an enormous face appears above/behind him. It is a giant version of himself lifting a giant shoe. The original man gets squashed.

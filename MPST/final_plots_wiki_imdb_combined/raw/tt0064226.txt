John Warner is a soldier for the Confederate States of America. When he receives a message that his lover is about to deliver a child he becomes a deserter. On his way to her he is captured and brought before a tribunal. Yet two old friends make sure he can escape. He makes it to the town where he expects his lover to be. Only is he too late too marry her because she's died in the meantime. He tries to take care of his child as a single father but the citizens of this town aren't supportive and thus another tragedy takes place.
The love of army deserter John Warner dies at deliverance and their baby child perishes after its grandfather, the landowner Sandoval, rejects it. Warner forms a feared outlaw gang with of two fellow deserters, one runaway lay brother, and some outlaws that join along the way. The local ranchers call in the army for protection, but except for an episode where Warner refuses to make a woman a hostage for money, we mainly see the gang harass Sandoval. One of the gang eventually tries to sell out Warner for a reward. The four core members stay together until Warner has avenged himself on Sandoval, and then they die a spectacular death at a shoot-out in a bullfighting arena.

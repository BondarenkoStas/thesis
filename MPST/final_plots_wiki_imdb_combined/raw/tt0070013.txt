At the end of the 19th century, on the north European coasts, live three shipwreckers simply nicknamed the "wreckers".
The Captain is their leader, followed by Le Bosco, Paul and the beautiful but perverted Tina.
When two young women accidentally stumble upon these wreckers, they brutally and violently rape them. The next day, the Captain thinks that he is going insane when he sees the women's dead bodies. He wrecks a tavern and gets into a fight with Le Bosco. The Captain, Tina, Le Bosco and Paul go back to the wreck to kill the women, who manage to escape. Wandering around, the women come across a clown who looks after them. The women are unable to speak, but a man tells them he can help them. They communicate via a drawing and the man realises that they want revenge. The women are the only ones who can free the devil from being imprisoned in the ruins of an old castle; by making love to each of them, he will give them the power to get their revenge. The women, now the "d√©moniaques", return for their revenge. At the beach, they are again attacked by the Captain and Le Bosco, who tie them to the wreck. The Captain goes mad and kills Tina and Le Bosco. He realises that what he has done is wrong, but is unable to save them, and the tide comes in and they all drown.

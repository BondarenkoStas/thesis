The episode opens with a recap of the previous three seasons before transitioning into Alec and Emily being reunited after Alec dropped the charges against her after she tried to kill the other Alec. In return for the favor, Carlos asks that Alec gain Piron technology for the police department, although Alec responds by explaining that Kellog has tricked the other him out of the company.
Across town, Kiera and Brad activate Brad's signal to see if they had averted his future, only for a number of soldiers from his time to suddenly appear and give chase to Kiera. One soldier eventually catches up to her and renders her unconscious. Alec and Carlos find her and take her to Alec's house. While there, Kiera asks Alec to find her a way home. In the morning Kiera wakes to find Jason, Emily, Lucas and Alec working on a way to take down Kellog.
While at the precinct, Carlos discovers that Dillon is planning on leaving the VPD. Alec meanwhile goes to Julian with his plan to take down Kellog, to which Julian agrees to help. This allows Alec to successfully hack into Kellog's system and retrieve the information that they need to send Kiera home.
The next day, Kiera and Alec attempt to track down Brad and the soldiers. Once they find them, Alec and Jason have Kiera steal a small pen-like device, however this causes suspicion from one of the soldiers, Vasquez, who opens fire upon Kiera and reveals her position. After a brief fight, Kiera is rendered unconscious and then wakes to find herself on the edge of a building being questioned by the soldiers who throw her off the building once they are finished.
Garza arrives and covers Kiera as she climbs into the car before they escape. Meanwhile, Emily is attacked by unknown men and kidnapped. That night, Carlos and Kiera share a drink as they discuss her returning to her own time.

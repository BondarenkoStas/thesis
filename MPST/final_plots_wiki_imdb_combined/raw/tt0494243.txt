A highly ambitious second-rung corporate executive, Victor Sandeman (Currie Graham), is losing his life style as a result of poor investments. He sees a way out via a company merger, but the old man who runs the business opposes the deal. Victor decides to murder the old-timer so his weak-willed highly malleable grandson will be in charge. Thus the merger will be approved through Victor's manipulation of the heir. One problem, while carrying out his nefarious ploy with the old man's body still in the trunk, he rear ends a vehicle. The driver whose car is hit, Christine Sternwald (Natasha Gregson Wagner), remains adamant that all the information needed for insurance purposes be provided. This leaves Victor in a quandary. He makes up his mind to get rid of the accidental witness. This leads to several neat complications in the story involving mistaken identity, frustrating lures, and a police investigation into a homicide made to look like a heart attack leading to a car crash.

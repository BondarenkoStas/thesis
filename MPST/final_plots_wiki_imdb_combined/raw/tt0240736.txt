A family's mountain vacation is interrupted by the arrival of a disheveled man hauling a trailer behind an ancient Cadillac. Pop, as he calls himself, tells the family a tall tale about the son he lost to illness. The family feels sorry for him and befriends him . . . not knowing the danger that is soon to come to them. In reality, his son Bernie is crazy, deranged and dangerous and kept straight-jacketed and chained up in Pop's trailer. Pop lets Bernie out only to stalk and harm campers while Pop helps himself to their belongings.
Not far away, a group of young people are preparing for two weeks of wilderness training. The camp is run by Regis, and his crazy girlfriend, Marcie, who tells them that P.J., a new camper has disappeared. We find out that the P.J., is dead.
Meanwhile, the police are trying to piece together what happened to the tourist family when an old cop, Taylor, shows up. He recognizes Pop, remembering how Bernie went on a murderous rampage years ago. Unable to convince the others, he heads for the wilderness camp on his own. By the time he arrives, it is too late. Bernie has already done his dirty work. As Taylor hunts for Bernie, it is a heart-stopping and frightening game of kill or be killed. As the end comes near, a bizarre twist happens that will keep you on the edge of your seat!

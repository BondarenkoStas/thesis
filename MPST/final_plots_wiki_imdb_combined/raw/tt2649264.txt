Misfits Slate and Kelly are wannabe police officers who both get put on desk duty - Slate for being over-zealous with her weapon; Kelly for being too scared to pick his up. The deciding moment happens between the two of them, so each blames the other for their demotion.Slate has taken a leave of absence from the force after her girlfriend Carly is killed in a hold up while they are on vacation in the City of Lights. Unable to move on, Slate lurks around Paris crime scenes, desperate to get a lead on who the murderer might be.Kelly is in Paris, on loan from the LAPD, to install his newly designed software program for tracking international criminals.When drag queens start showing up dead and the police are unable to infiltrate the community to find the killer, Slate is on the case, sure that this is a crime she has a chance of solving and maybe in the process, solving her girlfriend's murder. Unbeknownst to her, Kelly has been asked to act as a beard to help a not so feminine Paris detective (Said Taghmaoiu) go undercover and gain acceptance into the drag club. When Kelly is unceremoniously dumped once his usefulness has passed, he decides to do a little investigating on his own. Both on the same track, Slate and Kelly are literally thrown together and against Slate's better judgment, she agrees to team up with him.Slate plans for Kelly to go undercover as a performer and ferret out more intel. Much to her chagrin, he turns out to be a lousy drag queen, forcing Slate to take the role. Frustrated, she is about to drop his ass, when he proves his usefulness by hacking into secure files to dig up information on a suspect. Both realize they need each other to actually succeed. Despite a bumbling beginning, an embarrassing faux pas that includes beating up an innocent person, threats from the Commissaire (Thierry Lhermitte) that they will be arrested for interfering with a police investigation, and a risky stake out, they catch the killer or be killed themselves.

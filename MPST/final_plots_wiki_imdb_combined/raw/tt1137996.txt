Sometime after the events of the previous film in Romania, a female anaconda and a male anaconda are being held in a genetic research facility owned by Wexel Hall, for experimentation. The research project is led by Dr. Amanda Hayes (Crystal Allen) and funded by J.D. Murdoch (John Rhys-Davies), a well-known industrialist. While visiting the facility, Murdoch provokes the male anaconda with a large flashlight, and has it gassed to calm it down. However, as Murdoch, his assistant Pinkus (Ryan McCluskey) and Daryl (Alin Constantinescu) are about to leave, the anaconda kills Daryl and breaks through his enclosure's wall. As it escapes, it kills many of the people working in the lab. In looking through the facility, Amanda and Professor Eric Kane (Serban Celea), realize that the second (Queen) anaconda has also escaped. Murdoch calls in a team of animal hunters, led by Hammett (David Hasselhoff), to capture both snakes. Amanda and Pinkus go with them. At a small farm in the middle of the woods, the owner is eaten alive by one of the snakes.
The hunting party arrives later and begin formulating a plan of attack. During the first confrontation with the snake, two of the party are killed: Gronzy (Anthony Green) is stabbed by the genetically altered anaconda's very sharp tail and Dragosh (Bogdan Uritescu) gets his head bitten off by the snake. Hammett arrives and gives the team a lecture on how to kill the snake. As the group splits up, Amanda heads off in a car with two other team members, Victor (Toma DanilÄƒ) and Sofia (Mihaela Elena Oros). During the next confrontation with the snake, the anaconda spits acidic venom in Victor's face, burning it. The car crashes and Sofia is thrown off the car, broke her leg. As Amanda tries to leave the car to help her, the snake reappears and devours Sofia. Amanda is rescued by Hammett and both of them escape.
As they regroup, Amanda reluctantly reveals that the queen snake is pregnant and will give birth to more genetically "special" offspring in less than 24 hours. The teams want to call in the military, but Hammett forbids it and threatens Amanda with jail for her role in creating it. In the morning, the party begins searching for the snake, but Pinkus has his hand bitten off by the anaconda and is killed. While Hammett searches for the snake on foot, Amanda and one of the three remaining hunters, Nick (Patrick Regis), spot the snakes going into an old factory, follow them in to plant explosives around the building. Before they can finish, the male attacks. Nick helps Amanda escape but is wounded by the snake as it impales him with its tail, but Nick is able to discharge a grenade, killing both him and the snake. Hammett and his last remaining hunter, Andrei (Alin Olteanu), arrive heard the grenade goes off. As the two of them meet Amanda inside the factory, Andrei moves to set the charges, but Hammett kills him, causing Amanda to realize that Hammett is working for Murdoch wanting a live baby anaconda. Inside the building, the queen gives birth. After wounding Hammett, Amanda sets the timer on the explosives and escapes from the building, leaving Hammett to be attacked by the baby snakes while he tries to reach the bomb. Once she is at a safe distance, the explosives detonate, killing Hammett and the baby snakes. As she squats by a roadside burning all of her documentation on the snake research, one of Murdoch's men drives by heading for the factory where he finds one baby snake still alive and delivers the snake to Murdoch.

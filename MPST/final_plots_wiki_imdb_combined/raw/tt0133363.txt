The film is circular in plot as well as in a number of other ways (for example, the names of its main characters, Otto and Ana, are both palindromes). The film is centered around an incestuous love relationship between step-siblings. The two meet one day after school, when Ana's father dies, and her mother marries his father. Ana believes that Otto is the reincarnation of her father, but eventually the two of them fall in love. For a number of reasons, they are eventually separated, and Otto becomes a pilot flying between Spain and the Arctic Circle. Ana moves to the same area to leave behind her past and past lovers, and tries to get in touch with him again.
The movie plot is about two step-siblings who know each other since they were children. As they grow up, they find out that their love is not just a family love. They want to have a relationship like real couples have, even though they know it is prohibited they found a place where they can see each other at night. As time passes by their parents get divorced and they get separated. Ana's mother moves abroad, and Ana travels to Finland from where she persuades Otto to travel north to look for her. The deaths and lives of the characters are made more confusing through anachronisms and plot details.
The movie ends on an ambiguous note: in one version, Ana and Otto are reunited, while in the other Ana dies in a car accident. It is unclear which of the endings is real.

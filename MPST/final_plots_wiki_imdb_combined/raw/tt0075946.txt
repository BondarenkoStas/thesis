Scientist David Kelsey is infatuated with Annabelle, who has married another man, Gerald. Unable to move on from his first love, he labors in the vain hope that she will leave her new husband. He sends her letters and visits her home and asks her to leave her husband even after she has had a son by him. Under the assumed identity of William Neumeister, a freelance journalist who frequently travels, he buys a cabin in the country to serve as their eventual home. He furnishes it for her and spends weekends there as if she were there as well, cooking and serving meals for two. One weekend two of his friends, Wes Carmichael, a coworker who has his own unhappy home life, and Effie Brennan, who is infatuated with Kelsey, secretly follow him to the cabin. David gets into an altercation with Gerald who has tracked him to his weekend hideaway. When they scuffle and Gerald falls and breaks his neck, David reports the death to the police, continuing to identify himself as Neumeister and identifying Gerald as a total stranger to him.
To maintain his two identities, David builds a web of lies, betrayal and denial, relying at key points on the support of others like Effie. He fends off Annabelle's request to meet Neumeister to learn more about the circumstances of her husband's death. He then quits his job, sells his weekend house, and buys a new one nearer to Annabelle in his own name. He repeats his intrusive behavior with Annabell's new beau Grant. Effie and Wes visit David for the weekend. After some heavy drinking and quarreling, their relationships deteriorate rapidly, followed by more violence and David on the lam in New York City pretending to spend the day socializing with Annabelle. When recognized in a restaurant, David runs away, at times suffering from the delusion that Annabelle is fleeing with him.

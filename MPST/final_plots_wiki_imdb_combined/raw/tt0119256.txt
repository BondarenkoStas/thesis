Sydney, a gambler in his 60s, finds a young man, John, sitting forlornly outside a diner and offers to give him a cigarette and buy him a cup of coffee. Sydney learns that John is trying to raise enough money for his mother's burial. He offers to drive John to Las Vegas and teach him how to make some money and survive. Although he is skeptical at first, John agrees to Sydney's proposal.
Two years later, John, having gotten the money for the funeral, has become Sydney's protégé. John has a new friend named Jimmy, who does security work, and he is attracted to Clementine, a cocktail waitress in Reno.
Sydney encounters Clementine at night, learning that she moonlights as a prostitute. Although Clementine believes that Sydney might want to sleep with her, Sydney actually wants to set her up with John.
Sydney receives a frantic late-night phone call from John, summoning him to a motel. He arrives to find John and Clementine holding a hostage, who is a customer who had refused to pay Clementine $300 for sex. John also reveals that he and Clementine had eloped. The situation is dangerous, because John and Clementine have called the hostage's wife to demand the money. They do not have a plan, and they have beaten the hostage badly.
Sydney manages to calm the situation, advising John and Clementine to leave town and head to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon. After the two leave, Sydney cleans up the motel room to remove any evidence. He is then confronted by Jimmy, who threatens to tell John that Sydney had killed John's father, unless Sydney gives him $10,000. Sydney cannot pay it, but gives him $6,000 instead, later sneaking into Jimmy's house, waiting for him to return and then shooting him. He then returns to the same diner where he had first met John. The film ends with Sydney covering up blood on his shirt cuff.

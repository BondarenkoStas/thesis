After doing business with a strange travel agent, a group of teenagers, Vince, Candace, Paige, Garret, Toby, April and Roger, head out for a cabin in the Colorado woods. They accidentally crash their car while driving to the cabin, so, while the rest of the group set up the camping equipment, Vince leaves to attempt to locate the cabin. He instead finds the residence of a transvestite, Jake. Jake takes Vince captive. Meanwhile, Garret tells the group of the legend of psycho killer Miles DeCamp, and later that night, Toby's throat is slit. He survives after the group cover his wounds with duct tape, but the next day, the murderer attacks April, hacking off her arm, and impales Roger.
The survivors walk to Jake's residence. While they are there, Jake is attacked by being shot with an arrow. The rest of the group escape to the cabin, along the way finding April, who has survived the attack by sewing her arm back on. Next, Roger, who survived his impalement, shows up. The next morning, Toby's head is torn off, and the killer turns out to be Miles, who is also the strange travel agent the group met earlier in the film. Miles is about to kill Vince when he is shot by Jake, who has survived the arrow.

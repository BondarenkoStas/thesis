Buford (Sherman Hemsley) and Benny (Luis Ávalos) are two Greendale County, Georgia police officers sent to serve an eviction notice for an historic plantation. Two ghosts named Andrew Lee (Myron Healey), a former owner of the plantation, and Jethro (also played by Hemsley), a former slave, decide to prevent their old home from being foreclosed upon.
While the two officers explore the mansion, Buford discovers a hidden laboratory that was formerly used to experiment upon and torture the plantation slaves. Aggressive supernatural events begin occurring, but Lee and Jethro are confused because they are not responsible for these dangerous acts.
Buford and Benny then find the home's residents: two pretty sisters named Linda (Deborah Benson) and Lisa (Diana Brookes). The ladies explain that they believe their racist dead grandfather is the aggressive ghost. They introduce the men to Madame St. Esprit (Jennifer Rhodes), a spiritual medium who has been called upon to hold a séance. This leads to a supernatural attack involving lightning-like spirit energy.
During the evening and into the night, more ghostly mischief occurs. Jethro comes to realize that the slaves placed a voodoo curse upon their master and turned him into an immortal vampire. The vampire appears and the officers begin encountering zombies on the plantation grounds. Benny manages to kill the vampire by staking him through the heart.
Linda and Lisa reveal that they have been dead for many years and are tied to their house. To save the old plantation, Benny wins a boxing match (with a little help from Lee and Jethro) and uses the prize money to keep the home from going into foreclosure.
As Buford and Benny drive on a rural road at the night, Lee and Jethro kill the officers in a car crash. The ghosts of Buford and Benny happily return to the plantation to spend the after life with Linda and Lisa.

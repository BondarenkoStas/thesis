The year is 2050. In the United Corporations of America, which is plagued by overpopulation and an unemployment rate of 99.993%, the Death Race provides both entertainment and population control. Spanning from Old New York to New Los Angeles, the current Death Race features reigning champion Frankenstein, genetically engineered athlete Jed Perfectus, hip hop sensation Minerva Jefferson, female cultist Tammy the Terrorist, and the self-driving car ABE. Each driver is assigned a proxy, a broadcaster who allows the audience to experience the race through virtual reality. Frankenstein is immediately put off by his proxy Annie Sullivan and ignores her attempts to interview him and her suggestions to let his opponents pass him.
As the drivers race through the East Coast, rebels led by former network producer Alexis Hamilton set traps throughout the sector. Tammy and Minerva form a fierce rivalry when they steal each other's cult followers for kills. After running into a rebel trap, ABE malfunctions, kills its proxy, and abandons the race to discover its purpose. At the first checkpoint, Hamilton orders Annie, who is revealed to be her spy, to kill Frankenstein. Her attempt to seduce him fails, as he cares for nothing but winning the race. Elsewhere, the Chairman explains that Frankenstein has become a liability due to his longevity, whereas Perfectus will encourage his devoted fans to die at his hand. On day two of the race, the drivers pass through the heartland of the country, known for its gun-wielding citizens. Minerva's proxy Chi Wapp is killed by a suicide bomber sent by Tammy. Frankenstein takes a shortcut on another tip, but his car gets stuck in a cornfield. As Annie wanders off, Frankenstein fends off against a group of resistance ninjas to score more points. Upon reaching the next checkpoint, Annie admits to being a rebel and attempts to recruit Frankenstein. Politically apathetic, Frankenstein curses both the rebels and the government, reiterating his desire only to win the race. At a bar, Minerva reveals to Annie that she is an educated intellectual who plays a stereotypical hip hop character to survive. Coming back to Frankenstein's room, Annie saves his life from Perfectus, who is jealous of Frankenstein's popularity and sex appeal. Meanwhile, it is discovered that Hamilton and the Chairman are working together behind the scenes.
On day three of the race, the government sets "approved" routes for the drivers to avoid resistance attacks. Annie helps Frankenstein shift gears due to his right arm being damaged in his fight with Perfectus. Minerva chases Tammy, but she falls off a cliff to avoid Tammy's suicidal proxy. Tammy gloats at Minerva's death before a returning ABE rams her against the wall and self-destructs. Frankenstein and Annie wipe out Hamilton and her rebels while Perfectus takes a secret route toward the finish line. Both cars jockey for position until Perfectus loses control of his car and crashes into the VR control booth. Before crossing the finish line, Frankenstein broadcasts a message to his fans, suggesting the Chairman himself is worth 1,000 points. After killing the Chairman, to the delight of the spectators, Frankenstein encourages them to leave their virtual reality behind and start their own Death Race. As the country erupts into violent chaos, Frankenstein and Annie watch from the distance, suggesting they should repopulate the country after the chaos dies down.

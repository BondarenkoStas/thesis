A U.S. Marine named Gabriel Drummer (Shia LaBeouf) has a wife, Natalie (Kate Mara), and a son, Jonathan (Charlie Shotwell). Jonathan gets bullied at the school because Natalie said "I love you" to him in front of his schoolmates. Gabriel and Jonathan come up with "man down" as a secret code for "I love you". Before serving a tour to Afghanistan, Gabriel promises to get in touch with Jonathan. Gabriel's best friend and fellow Marine Devin Roberts (Jai Courtney), who injured his arm, stays at the city and takes care of Natalie and Jonathan for a while.
Gabriel serves a tour to Afghanistan. Later, he is joined by Devin. They are attacked by the Afghan armed group. Devin is fatally shot and apologizes to Gabriel. Gabriel finds a memo, on which Devin's password for a video chatting website is written. Gabriel accesses to the website and realizes that Natalie had a relationship with Devin.
Gabriel is interviewed by Captain Peyton (Gary Oldman) about the incident in Afghanistan. Peyton is concerned about Gabriel's mental condition. However, Gabriel insists that he is okay and leaves Peyton's office.
When Gabriel returns home, he finds that the city is devastated. Accompanied with Devin, he searches desperately for the whereabouts of Natalie and Jonathan. The two encounter Charles (Clifton Collins, Jr.), who has an envelope of the letter that Gabriel wrote to Jonathan. Devin scuffles with Charles and accidentally shoots him. Gabriel finds Jonathan and takes him out. The police surround them.
Coming into the building that Gabriel and Jonathan are hiding, Natalie talks to Gabriel. Gabriel realizes that he is confused. It is revealed that the city is not devastated. Devin died in Afghanistan. The one who shot Charles is not Devin but Gabriel. He cries and apologizes to Natalie and Jonathan. Immediately after, he is shot by the police. Jonathan runs up to him. Gabriel tries to hand over a memo to Jonathan. It says "man down".

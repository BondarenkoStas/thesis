The film narrates the true story of João Guilherme Estrella, an upper-middle-class man from the State of Rio de Janeiro that would become the head of the drug traffic in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
João is a young boy from an upper-middle-class family of the city of Niterói, the second wealthiest city in the state of Rio. João demonstrates a knack for entrepreneurship early on in his life, when he delivers papers as a teenager, unusual for an upper-middle-class teen in Brazil. Once his parents get divorced, João begins partying a lot, holding lavish parties in the downstairs of his dad's house. At one of these parties, João meets his love interest, Sofia. The more he parties, the more he begins dealing cocaine, tying back to the entrepreneurship alluded to at the start of the film.
The film shows the glamorous side of drug dealing, with João and Sofia dealing in Europe and spending exorbitant amounts of money.
Eventually, João gets caught and sent to prison and court. He tries to lie his way out of the situation in court, but then takes pity on the woman who would get blamed instead of him and does his time in prison. João's story is received as a tale of rehabilitation, as for now he is a successful musician and music producer.

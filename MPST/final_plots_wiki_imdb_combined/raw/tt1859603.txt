Before leaving on a business trip one morning, her father informs her that his new employee, a recent college graduate named Amy, will be coming to stay in their guest house for a few days while she gets settled. Amy arrives and Rachel, lonely and still affected by the death of her mother, feels drawn to Amy. Over the course of the weekend, the two women spend much time together and become close. Eventually they become lovers. When Frank returns, he is shocked to find them in bed together and lashes out at both of them. To Rachel's shock, it is revealed that her father and Amy slept with each other. Disgusted and feeling betrayed, Rachel breaks off their relationship.
Some time later, Rachel performs a show at a small club in San Francisco. Afterwards, she exits and finds Amy waiting outside. The two reconcile and decide to pursue their relationship further.

When Porky finds a golden egg in his henhouse, it was revealed that one of the geese laid it. But, knowing full well about what happened to the goose that laid the golden egg (a reference to Aesop's Fables), the goose tells Porky that Daffy laid it. After finding out about the fame Daffy got for laying the egg, Rocky and his gang hustle him back to their den and demand more output. Daffy tries to stall for time, at one point asking for surroundings that would make him more comfortable. Rocky and his henchmen oblige, but then demand the egg.
Daffy tries to stall for time, but is given five minutes to lay his egg or else. The duck tries various ways to escape his predicament, but is stopped at every turn. When time runs out, the gangsters stalk Daffy...only to find he really has laid a golden egg.
Daffy is relieved that he met Rocky's demand and will be allowed to go free...until Rocky escorts the duck into a room containing dozens of egg crates and orders him to lay enough to fill them, much to Daffy's despair, causing him to faint.
=== Alternative Ending ===
When this cartoon was used in The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie, a new ending was used. Instead of Daffy fainting, Bugs Bunny, alias Elegant Mess (a parody of Eliot Ness), arrives with the police to bust Rocky and his gang. At the same time, Daffy tiredly carries out Rocky's orders. Naturally, Rocky and his gang are arrested and Daffy is taken to a hospital on a stretcher. Bugs asks Daffy if he needs anything and Daffy requests for a proctologist immediately.

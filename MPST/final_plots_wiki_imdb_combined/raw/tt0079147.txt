Kung fu master Chen (Lau Kar-leung) is tricked and his hands crippled by the villainous gangster and brothel-keeper Tuen (Lo Lieh), who also forces his sister (Kara Hui) into becoming his concubine. No longer able to practice the martial arts, he becomes a lowly street entertainer, performing with his beloved trained monkey Ah Mao. Monkey (Hsiao Ho) is a petty thief and meets Chen and the two begin an odd friendly relationship until Tuen's men slaughter Chens pet monkey, causing Little Monkey (Hsiao Hou) to try and take revenge for him. Monkey is trained by Master Chen and, although the training is not quite complete, believes he is strong enough and leaves Master Chen. He goes into the streets and fights Tuen's money collectors. He easily defeats them all and soon he is led to Tuen. Monkey confronts Tuen initially and gets beat, Miss Chen helps Monkey escape but is killed by Tuen. Monkey returns to Master Chen and tells Chen about the meeting with his sister. Chen, this time finishes training Monkey, and then Monkey comes back to the brothel to fight Tuen again. He gets past all the men but gets trapped. Chen appears and saves him and they fight side by side. After that, Monkey engages combat with Tuen and soon gets the advantage. Tuen, seeing that he can't win tries to escape but Monkey doesn't let him and takes his hands. He smashes them into glass to cripple them, the same as what Tuen did to Chen. After that, it seems Monkey is done but then he says he also wants to avenge Chen's sister and kills Tuen.

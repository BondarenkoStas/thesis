=== Overview ===
Laura, a nude model, returns to her small-town hometown after learning her ex-boyfriend has begun a relationship with her aunt Cynthia.
=== Synopsis ===
During a photo shoot, nude model Laura (Isadora Edison) receives a phone call from her sister Winnifred (Chelsea Mundae). Laura learns that her ex-boyfriend, high-powered attorney Nelson Nyland (John Samuel Jordan), is dating her aunt Cynthia (Tina Tyler); not only that, they are making plans to move in together. While she tells Winnie that's she's pleased, Laura is emotionally hurt.
After hanging up, Laura asks her photographer, Jennine (Andrea Davis), for a few weeks off. Jennine agrees, commenting that she has some good shots for her editor. Intercut with a montage of Laura and Jennine having sex, Jennine comments that she has "an awful schoolgirl crush" on Laura. Laura is initially put off, but then passionately kisses Jennine.
Meanwhile, in Meadow Springs, Nelson visits his law partner, and sister, Judith (Kay Kirtland). Judith invites Nelson out to a romantic dinner, but Nelson explains that he is expected by Cynthia.
At Cynthia's cabin, Nelson arrives to find Cynthia seductively rubbing herself. Making himself comfortable, Nelson approaches her from behind and cups her breasts. After several minutes of foreplay, they retire to the bedroom.
At a cafe, Winnie (Chelsea Mundae) asks her co-worker Louise (A.J. Khan) why she pushed Winnie so hard into telling Laura about Cynthia and Nelson. Louise admits that she is a potential novelist, and that she is writing an expose about the town's sexual goings-on. The scene then intercuts with both Nelson and Cynthia, and Laura and Jennine having sex.

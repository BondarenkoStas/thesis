Dr. Lauren Porter's friend was killed a few years ago. Tom Beckwith, an ex-cop who gave up the profession after his wife died, follows Lauren's classes in order to become a psychiatrist. He learns that Lauren has a personality disorder after she convinces him to follow her with a camera and film her.
On his first tailing, Tom is beaten by a nightclub's owner who also turns out to be the boyfriend of Lauren's alter ego, Lena. Tom quits, but Lauren persuades him to reconsider. They confide in each other about their respective families. Tom is having a hard time raising his tomboyish daughter Ronni alone while Lauren confides she was the only witness for her mother and stepfather's murders. Her real father, meanwhile, has moved on and is now a happy husband and father again.
Tom tries to connect with his ex-colleagues in investigating the murders. He learns that Lauren has an ex-husband, Charles, with whom she stayed on good terms. However, Charles is soon killed.
Tom decides to invite Lauren home for a dinner, where she makes Ronni understand that despite any personal problems, Tom is still her father and cares about her.
Believing the solution can be found at Lauren's childhood house, Tom drives her there. They discover that Lauren's dad is the real culprit. He manipulated his daughter, the only witness, by saying that she was as responsible as he was. Tom is shot in the arm but manages to disarm Lauren's dad, who falls out a window and dies.
Tom promises to keep in touch with Lauren, who is committed to an asylum. Before he departs, they kiss.

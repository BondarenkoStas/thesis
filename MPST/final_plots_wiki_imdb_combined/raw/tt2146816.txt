With complex dramatic sensibilities reminiscent of great filmmakers like Krzysztof Kielowski and Darren Aronofsky comes Michael Sorokorensky's LOGOS. Rich in symbolism and deliberately presented, each carefully selected frame layers a deeper meaning. LOGOS is a brutal story told gently.James Carroll, a nineteen year old computer science student, is mourning the death of his father who jumped out of the first tower in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. James has become convinced that uncertainty is the root of all evil and strives to contain world's problems using sophisticated computer algorithms. In the process, he distances himself from the very elements he wishes to correct, and delves deeper into the dark recesses of his mind.Although knowing the future is one step closer to controlling it, James must first overcome his own frailties. But the world isnt making it easy, and James' shaky grasp on reality is tested further by the few remaining people in his life; his egomaniacal roommate, a clumsy best friend, and an elusive romantic interest. Each person somehow finds ways to hurt James, quite often unintentionally. Even complete strangers manage to multiply James angst and yearning for solitary predictability. Only computers and simpler organisms provide James the much needed consolation.The more James alienates himself, the deeper he burrows into his work, the more tenuous his return to normalcy becomes. As the days go by and little is done to elate his suffering, James starts to cave. Until, finally, he can take no more.Somewhere between James' dreams and reality lies the truth.

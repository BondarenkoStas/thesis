A strange boy is being chased by a suspicious white van. He hides from his pursuers, stumbling upon a young girl playing outside with her 2 best friends. He motions her towards him. For a split second, the young girl thought she saw the boy's eyes change yet she remains unafraid as he was the most beautiful boy she had ever seen. As quickly as he came, he was gone but he leaves her with a gift. A single, mysterious blue lollipop.Fast forward 10 years. The young girl and her friends now grown up, decide to embark on a coming of age road trip adventure. As they drive on the open highway, they come upon a lone hitchhiker. Locking eyes with the mysterious stranger, the girl hit with a sudden pang of dejavu. Though she would never pick-up someone she didn't know, she ignores her friends' pleas and offers the strange boy a ride. As he gets in the car, he opens his duffle full of candy that he offers the girls.The "candy" lets those (the stranger allows) have temporary access into his "world". They see what he sees, feel what he feels, (and for a short time), they in essence become what he is.Who or what is the mysterious Candyman? Where is he from? No one knows. And no one can predict what happens when you take candy from a stranger.

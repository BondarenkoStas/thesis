John Travolta plays Strip Sunset, the ultimate female man-toy! If you are a fan of sexy fun on the beach, May-December romance, foot worship, muddy dogs, and awkward, boner-killing PG-13 psuedo-sex scenes, look no further. This is the brownest film ever made. This is the 70's, with a large side of 70's. Contemplating suicide? Do it. Contemplating John Travolta's sexuality? I'M NOT. He got 2 (count em, TWO) HJ's from Lily Tomlin. HE'S STRAIGHT AS FUCK DOG. Go kill yourself. But watch MbM first!

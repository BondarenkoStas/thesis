Major Murphy Black (Reb Brown) leads a group of commandos through the jungles of an unnamed island, but unknown to all involved but Mascher (Mel Davidson), they are being stalked by Mascher's robot invention, Omega-1. Over the protests of Mascher, the group first saves a volunteer hospital worker, Virginia (Catherine Hickland), from a band of guerrillas, then take out the hospital camp, killing all the guerrillas there, also. At this point, the robot begins killing members of the commando group, one by one. That night, Mascher admits to Murphy that he created Omega-1, that it was acting sporadically, and that he was there to check out the match-up between the decorated Murphy and Omega-1.
The next day, they continue, and are further stalked by the Robot. At one point, as Mascher is reviews a computer to check Omega-1's location, one of the commandos tosses it into the river, declaring that Macscher is now in the same danger they are. Later, Mascher reveals the radio device which can destroy Omega-1, but the robot kills Mascher and others, leaving only Black and Virginia, and takes the radio destruct device. That night, Black listens to an audio tape given by Mascher, which reveals that Omega-1 is a human/machine hybrid, whose human parts were made up of the brain of Black's old friend, Lt. Martin Woodrie. Omega-1 attacks in the house they're hiding, but Virginia stuns the robot with acid, and Black blows up the house. Black and Virginia reach the shore, and try to signal the boat, but Omega-1 catches up, and chases Black into the jungle. Cornering him, the robot removes the visor of his mask, hands Black the destruct radio, and instructs him to key the destruct sequence. Black does so, and returns to the shore.

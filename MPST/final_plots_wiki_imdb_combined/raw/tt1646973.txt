What isn't mentioned in the brief review is that the house is almost entirely dark and although some light is seen through the boarded up windows, it is not enough to illuminate anything within. Fluorescent lanterns, candles and a Polaroid-type camera provide the lighting. Importantly, Nestor, the owner who is selling the property, tells Laura and her father, who are there to do yard work and minor repairs on the house, that tiles are loose in places and it is dangerous to go upstairs. He tells them explicitly not to go upstairs. Laura and her father settle down to sleep so they can awaken early and start work on the grounds, then the house. Laura starts hearing noises, first outside, then upstairs. Laura has to try twice to fully awaken her father, who hasn't heard any noise. When he finally awakens, he tells her to stay put, that he will go upstairs and investigate the noise. Suspense steadily builds. You won't want to leave your seat. The language is Spanish, but there isn't much dialogue so subtitles really don't distract.

Harrison (Dean Winters) is a struggling freelance writer who becomes the unwilling babysitter of a precocious little six-year-old girl, Jenny (Emily Mae Young), when her mother, Melissa (Lorraine Ansell), one of Harrison's former girlfriends whom he hasn't seen for years, asks him to babysit because she needs to be out of town for several weeks.
Harrison is originally unenthusiastic about the arrangement, but soon he develops a tenderness for Jenny after spending time with her. Little Jenny decides to play matchmaker for Harrison and Holly (Yasmine Bleeth), a beautiful woman he admires who frequently visits the same coffee shop as Harrison and Jenny.
Harrison tells stories for Jenny about Mr. Dodoâ€”her favorite stuffed animal. Jenny secretly records them and gets Holly to transcribe the books, and they submit them to his publisher. Harrison accidentally discovers that he is Jenny's father. Jenny's mother returns early and takes her away. Harrison tries to find a job in order to have financial stability and eligible for custody of Jenny. Harrison tries to get custody of Jenny instead of her uncaring mother. The publisher contacts and contracts him for the Mr. Dodo series, which becomes a publishing success. Despite this, the judge (James Earl Jones) grants custody to Melissa. However, Melissa later realizes that she was wrong and returns Jenny to Harrison.

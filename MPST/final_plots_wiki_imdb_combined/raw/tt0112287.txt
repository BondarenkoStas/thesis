Joel Winter is a "special one". That's what the vampiress Rachel [Laura McLaughlin]
tells him in 1970 when she first sees the curious little 5-year old in the
forest watching her feed. As Joel [Mick McCleery] matures, Rachel visits him again and
again, asking him to stab her, electrocute her, run a chain saw through
her, teaching him to kill without feeling. She asks for these things
because she says that she likes to feel human again, but she's really
honing Joel's ability to kill. That's what makes him "special". On the
other hand, Joel does these things out of love for Rachel, until Rachel
goes away, that is, and leaves him to do these things to others
(altogether, 43 others).Then it's 1993. Joel's mother died in 1990, and Joel moved to New
York two years later. Joel marries Kathy. Two years later, Kathy leaves
Joel. He is desolate. He starts looking for Rachel again. When he receives
a number of unsigned letters asking him "Are you hungry?" and advising him
to "Feed the Hunger" at The Hungry Club, Joel can't resist. He goes to the
club and meets another vampire, Angie [Sasha Graham]. Angie feeds on Joel's anger and
rage, which actually calms Joel for a while and allows him to build a
relationship with human Allison [Jolee Becker]. But he's still in search of Rachel.
Meanwhile, Angie is turning Joel into a vampire and hounding him to "go
feed" and to be what he was meant to be--a hunter. Seeing Allison as a
hindrance to honing Joel's abilities, Angie kills Allison and sets up Joel
to take the fall for it. Joel is shot by the police but, as a vampire, he
rises again.In the final scene, ten years later, Joel finally finds Rachel.
Rather than loving her, however, he kills her. He hates what she and Angie
have made him into. The hunger that Rachel and Angie recognized as the
hunter in Joel has turned him into not just a hunter or a vampire but a
vampire hunter. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl].

The cartoon starts with all furniture and things being thrown out of the house until Spike stops and questions why they cannot be friends with each other. The trio make a truce, sign a peace treaty and become allies.
As the three of them sleep together, Tom covers Jerry up, Jerry closes Spikeâ€™s mouth to stop him snoring and Spike turns off the alarm clock to make breakfast. Spike pours three glasses of milk as Tom brushes Jerry's teeth and cleans his ears. Then, Spike takes three glasses and pours equal milk in Tom and Jerry's glass but pours more milk in his own glass. Jerry goes outside while Butch is making a meal on a garbage can, and picks Jerry up and puts him on the plate. Tom saves Jerry by flipping the can's lid into Butch's face. Tom then kisses Jerry, much to Butch's disbelief and he shrieks loudly and beats himself silly up with a brick.
Tom then walks along the sidewalk until a dog eating a bone grabs Tom and goes to eat him. Spike saves Tom by knocking all off the teeth out of the dog and pokes an apple stuck in Tom's mouth into Tom's throat, saving him but knocking him out by accident.
The three then walk along the sidewalk, and Spike takes off his fur to help them walk across a muddy puddle, but a meat truck driving by splashes the mud on their faces, causing the characters to reemerge in blackface. A steak drops out of the truck, much to the trio's delight. They take it home, but each of them greedily divides the steak so that they have the largest share (Tom stabs Spike's hand with a fork), causing a fight that causes the steak to fly out of the window and drop into the gutter water and down the drain. The three look at each other upon realizing they can no longer be pals, Spike then tears the treaty and they the trio continue their original fight to fight/beat each other up.

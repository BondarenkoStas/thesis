America's Dark Secrets Documentary takes a look at some of the most infamous extremists, radical & cult groups in American history. We also highlight the recent case involving the allege Black Hebrews crimes in Durham, North Carolina. What were the ties to top-secret government agencies; mass murders, suicides, illegal drug experimentation and the abundance of racial injustice? Who profits off of such groups? Are these extremists victims of urban terrorism, culprits or simply both?This documentary focuses on three main stories. First, we look at the kidnapping of a world famous newspaper heiress' daughter (Patty Hearst). Next, is the bombing of a radical group called "Move", who protested against police brutality in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One survivor (Ramona Africa) gives an interview on Democracy Now during the 30 year anniversary of this event. The bomb killed six African - American adults and five children dropped by Pennsylvania State Police. The infamous Mayor was (Frank Rizzo) preceded by (Wilson Goode, Sr.) The 3rd segment of this film is the biggest, single loss of life prior to 9/11 led by cult leader (James Warren "Jim" Jones.) The charismatic preacher led a crusade of mostly minorities to the jungles of Guyana, South America. One determined U.S. Congressman named (Leo Ryan) wanted to put a stop to Jones & aggressively pursue C.I.A involvement. He was assassinated in the line of duty. There are survivors of this massacre still alive today like (Tim Carter) and former Ryan aide (Jackie Speier). She is still involved with California politics & survived being shot five times with Leo Ryan.What we need today is for Congress to pass a "Truth & Reconciliation" Law. The tax paying citizens, voters & public deserves to know the truth about our past in order to prepare for the future.

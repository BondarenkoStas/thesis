The film has a fairly crude and unfocused plot, but the movie essentially tells the tale of Gwar's conflict with the Morality Squad, after the theft of Oderus Urungus' "Cuttlefish of Cthulhu" (or penis). In the mean time, GWAR is called to New York City to shoot a commercial for "GWAR cereal": a cornflake-like food that is sprinkled with cocaine rather than sugar, thus turning the kids eating the cereal into addicts.
As the Morality Squad prepares for their attack on GWAR, their religious representative, Father Bohab, is convicted of child molestation and sodomy towards a twelve-year-old choirboy. Despite the clear evidence of Bohab's crimes, the Squad feel he was framed by GWAR (particularly by the band's manager, Sleazy P. Martini, who took part in exposing him); he is later released and the charges are dropped. Later, while Bohab is picketing against GWAR along with other protestors, GWAR and Sleazy brutally attacks the crowd, culminating in the disembowelment of Bohab and him being sodomized with his own cross.
GWAR then travels to a nightclub, where they all become wasted on cocaine. The next morning, the Cuttlefish of Cthulhu (having escaped the Morality Squad's grasp) reunites with a hungover Oderus, and warns them of the imminent attack by the Morality Squad. After a tough battle, GWAR emerges victorious over the Morality Squad. Later, the giant T-Rex, Gor-Gor, is born and begins attempting to destroy the world. GWAR then engage in another battle with their tyrannic offspring, eventually killing it as well. The movie fades out as the Cuttlefish of Cthulhu is happily reunited with Oderus Urungus.

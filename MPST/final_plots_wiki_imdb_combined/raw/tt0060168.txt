When Franz [Walter Janovitz] and Eva [Virginia Christine] Oster's daughter Lisa [Hannie Landman] is killed by Dracula, the Osters swear to fight this menace. Dracula shows up again in the guise of Uncle James Underhill [John Carradine], newly arrived in town to help out at the Double Bar B Ranch. Dracula has assumed this identity because he is smitten with Betty Bentley [Melinda Plowman], niece of the real James Underhill. Fortunately, Betty's boyfriend is retired gunslinger Billy the Kid [Chuck Courtney]. Billy gets suspicious of the gruff and heartless Underhill and starts to poke around. He invites the Osters to move onto the ranch and care for Betty. Mrs Oster bars the windows with wolfbane until Betty decides all this vampire stuff is silly. Billy talks to the town doctor who advises him to get Underhill before a mirror. If he casts no reflection, he's vampire.Underhill starts to throw his weight around. He fires Billy and drives the Osters out to the bunkhouse. Billy kills a previous foreman in self-defense but gets jailed anyway. Betty begins to awaken with bites on her neck. When Underhill comes to take Betty back to the ranch, the doctor holds up a mirror and sees no reflection. Sure now that Underhill is a vampire, the doctor springs Billy from jail and the three of them (Billy, doctor, and Sheriff Griffin [Roy Barcroft]) pursue the vampire and Betty out to the abandoned mine where Dracula has his coffin stored. The sheriff tries unsuccessfully to shoot Dracula, so Billy throws a gun at Dracula's head and knocks him out. While Dracula is on the ground, Billy stakes him with a kitchen knife.

Kat Collins, grown restless with life in rural Utah, decides to 'take her shot' in Hollywood. Along the way she picks up Rhonda Wallace, who just baled out of a would-be-rapist's pickup truck. Together, they head to LA and meet up with Rhonda's sleazy photograph pal, Buck Lewis, who takes the girls out on the town - meaning Mr. G's biker bar, where Kat is nearly raped.
As promised, Buck gets Kat and Rhonda a screen test at Mr. G's casting agency the next day. When the girls tumble to the fact that they're being auditioned for a role in a porno film they try to leave, which leads to an altercation and a trip in a squad car. Then it's a swing through the local kangaroo court, and the girls find themselves in the Honeywell State Prison for Women in no time flat!
Kat is ordered to tell her family she's out of the country on an acting job, and can't be reached - but sister Tracy is already in LA, tracking her down. She learns that Kat was taken away by the police, but is told at the station that there's no record of an arrest. Undaunted, Tracy's plan is to follow Kat's movements, which should lead her to her sister. And it does!
Now Kat, Tracy and Rhonda are together in a place where a two month sentence may in fact be a death sentence. Honeywell may be a prison, but not one sanctioned by the State of California. The pipeline from Buck's studio to Mr. G's casting couch to kangaroo court to Honeywell Prison is all part of a human trafficking organization that captures, subdues and sells young women into slavery.
Fortunately for the girls, martial arts maven Dirk Ramsey is hot on their trail - but will he get to them in time?

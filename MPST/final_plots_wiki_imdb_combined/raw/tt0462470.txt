Sam (voiced by Pamela Segall Adlon) can't sleep due to a fear of the dark that fills his room. He is inspired by an issue of his favorite superhero comic, Pajama Man, to take matters into his own hands. Journeying into his closet with his purple Pajama Sam mask (Signature-Edition), All-Metal Pajama Man Lunch Box (Portable Bad Guy Containment Unit) and his Illuminator Mark 5 Jr. Flashlight, Sam tumbles down into the Land of Darkness and is soon stopped by a group of trees acting as customs. After freeing himself, Sam goes on an adventure to reclaim his lost equipment. He befriends a boat named Otto and a mine cart named King, who help Sam throughout his exciting search. After a quest spanning a river, a lava-filled mine, and Darkness's house, Sam goes to confront Darkness. Sam is still afraid at first, but then he finds Darkness is friendly. Darkness tells him that he is just lonely and wants a playmate. After the two of them play together by playing the game "Cheese and Crackers", Sam leaves the closet and finds himself back in his own room. No longer afraid of the dark, Sam quickly falls asleep.

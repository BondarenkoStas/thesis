Low budget filmmaker JAYSON (Glenn Plummer) has made the movie of his dreams but to his dismay, it cant sell in Hollywood. The distributors tell him, You have nothing exploitative in your movie. Add some sex scenes, more violence, and maybe well buy your film. The distraught filmmaker approaches his neophyte, semi-psychotic producer BRAVO (Blaine Cade) and tells him, Put together a cast and crew were going to re-shoot and give them what they want! Bravo nervously tells him, Were out of money. Jayson screams at him, I dont care. Do WHATEVER you have to do!Bravo enlists a young movie crew to follow them into the remote backwoods of the Great Bear Mountains by telling them, Theres no money, but when we sell this, youll all get a big piece of the profits for your efforts and great craft service! Various B movie actors, including stuntman BURT (Edward Hendershott) and his gorgeous wannabe actress girlfriend ASHLEY (Linda Bella), join them as Jayson has promised her a role in the movie. After a series of behind-the-scenes interviews of this quirky bunch, they begin filming. Jayson is accidentally killed by his inept crew, and in the midst of all the confusion, Bravo strangely convinces them to finish the movie. They reluctantly agree but soon after are attacked by an unrelenting swarm of deadly devil dogs from Hell. Burt, Ashley, and Bravo briefly escape the danger as they are rescued by two angels sent from Heaven to battle the monsters. Unknown to them all, Bravo has made a pact with the Devil to provide twelve souls (theirs) in order to get the movie made. Mayhem ensues as the survivors attempt to kill the demons and close the entrance to Hell before the whole Earth is consumed by evil!

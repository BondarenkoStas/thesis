Patty Butler an attractive young female police officer is pretending to be a runaway girl with the nickname of Chicklet
She has been given permission by the Department to be the live in girlfriend of Thomas Stick Henderson a known drug dealer so that they can gather evidence against him
To back up her cover story Detective Bo Lockley has been given an almost impossible assignment without being told she is actually an undercover officer he is instructed to spend a few weeks trying to find this young runaway Chicklet who is believed to be somewhere in New York City
By Bo s actions of openly looking around and trying to find her this will end up being reported back to Stick which should convince him that his girlfriend really is a runaway
Bo has no idea that his assignment is basically a fool s errand being used as a cover story
Amazingly enough Bo is a determined and persistent detective and despite what should have been a hopeless task he tracks Chicklet to a disco club in the city
Chicklet is unaware of this effort by her superiors to solidify her cover she is terrified that this cop is going to blow her cover
So she promises to meet him the next day if he just leaves
Bo is thanked by his supervisor Lt Seidensticker and told to forget about her and go back to his previous assignment
Either infatuated with Chicklet or not able to just allow her to be another young girl abandoned by the system when she fails to show the next day as she promised he goes to Stick s loft to rescue her
In the process Bo and Stick become engaged in a firefight with Chicklet caught in the crossfire
Stick is able to escape the apartment
Stick runs across town barefoot carrying a handgun and dressed only in boxer shorts pursued by Bo into a department store where they are trapped in a Mexican standoff in one of the store s elevators
Eventually the police barricade the elevator and Bo s partner Crunch grabs Bo when he and Stick leave through the elevator s emergency exit ceiling panel
Bo having been pulled to safety the police open fire on Stick killing him
In the aftermath of the firefight and the subsequent killing of Stick it is discovered that Officer Butler has been killed in Stick s loft by Bo and an investigation has to be made as to whether he was negligent
It s determined that she was killed as a result of Bo trying to defend himself from Stick shooting at him and thus the shooting was accidental
Bo however is so depressed by what he has done that he hangs himself in his jail cell before he finds out that it was an accident
The film is in effect a report of an incident to the Police Commissioner which explains the title

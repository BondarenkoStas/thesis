5 years after his attempt to eat Red Riding Hood was thwarted by a passing Woodsman the Wolf has settled down with his wife named Doris However his dreams are being plagued by remembrances of his failure and it even begins to interfere with his everyday life
Doris attempts to help him calm down but nothing seems to help
Sadly she even has second thoughts about having married the wolf remembering how a nerdish fox named Leonard wanted to marry her after high school promising to make her happy
However Doris was enthralled by the Wolf instead and turned down Leonard s proposal Doris tells the Wolf that he needs to find a way to move on and Leonard then spends two days building a time machine
Telling Doris that this will solve his problems he goes back in time and has his past self help him
With the main Wolf in bed the past Wolf takes down the Woodsman when he shows up and it seems the two have succeeded until Grandma emerges from the nearby closet which just happned to be her ammo closet
After the two wolves are chased out of the house by gunfire they return to the present day
Doris tells the two that maybe they aren t meant to get Red Riding Hood
However the two decide that they just need to try again Going back in time the two get the past wolf to help them
It looks like they have taken care of the Woodsman and keeping Grandma from getting to the ammo when the lead Wolf joyously tells Red to scream all she wants
Red takes a deep breath and her scream shatters all the windows and the glass on an in case of fire box
This causes numerous faceless firemen to appear blasting the wolves out of the house with their high pressure water hoses The group of three wolves returns to the present and attempt to hatch a new plan with Doris once again asking them to forget about it As expected they go back in time but something else happens
Each time they fail they bring another past wolf back to the present to formulate what went wrong
Each time they think they ve compensated for all possibilities something else goes wrong
At one point police show up
Another time Grandma runs them out of her home in a tank and at one point a nuclear explosion decimates the house Doris quietly serves multiple cups of coffee to the wolves but suddenly vanishes with the time machine Taking it back in time she appears before Leonard Fox and this time accepts his proposal In the end Doris lives happily ever after with Leonard while the numerous wolves still keep bickering and arguing about their past failures leaving the main Wolf to quietly call himself a moron

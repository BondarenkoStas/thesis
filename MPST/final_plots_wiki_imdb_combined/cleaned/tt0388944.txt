Setting Final Fantasy XII is set within the land of Ivalice during an age when magic was commonplace and airships plied the skies crowding out the heavens
At this time magicite a magic rich mineral is commonly used in magic spells and in powering airships a popular form of transportation in Ivalice
Ivalice is divided into three continents Ordalia Valendia and Kerwon
Ordalia is located in the western part of Ivalice
The Rozarrian Empire makes its home in the vast inland plains of this continent as the eastern portion of it is largely desert and jagd lawless regions so rich in Mist the ethereal manifestation of magicite that airships cannot function
Valendia is the home of Imperial Archadia where lush highlands dot the landscape
Central to the story is Dalmasca a small kingdom between the two continents and empires
Located in the middle of the Galtean Peninsula of Ordalia Dalmasca is surrounded by an expanse of desert
The temperate climate of Dalmasca differs from the cold environs of Kerwon to the south and the lush plains of Valendia and Ordalia
During this time Ivalice is beset by the pending war between the forces of Rozarria and Archadia
Caught between the two powerful Empires Dalmasca and a number of smaller nations have already been subjugated by Archadia two years before the game begins

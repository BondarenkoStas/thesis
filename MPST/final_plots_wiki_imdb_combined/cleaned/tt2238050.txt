In 1988 when Katrina Kat Connors was 17 her mother Eve disappeared without a trace
The story weaves back and forth with flashbacks of Eve s past life and the present day
In the flashbacks Eve was a wild girl who gradually changed into a domesticated housewife after marrying Brock an ordinary man who leads an uneventful life
While Kat explores her blossoming sexuality with her handsome but dim witted neighbor and schoolmate Phil Eve struggles to deal with aging and quenching her youthful wildness
She tries to be sexy when Brock is away even luring Phil s attention
After Eve disappears Kat deals with her abandonment without much issue occasionally releasing her own wild side seducing the detective investigating her mother s disappearance
The film then jumps forward three years to the spring of 1991
On a break from college Kat returns home and seems unfazed to learn that her father is in a relationship with a co worker
The detective Kat has been having an affair with informs her that Brock might have killed Eve after catching her cheating
Kat dismisses this theory just like she did three years ago but after mentioning the topic to her friends Beth and Mickey they tell her they suggested this same theory to her and she dismissed them as well
Kat suspects Phil of sleeping with Eve and confronts him the night before she is to return to college but Phil angrily rebuffs it and tells her that her father knows where her mother is
Kat begins to unpack Brock s suspiciously locked freezer in their basement but is stopped when he walks in on her
She questions him about her mother s disappearance asking if he does in fact know where she is but he denies having any knowledge of her whereabouts
Believing her father Kat bids her him goodbye and tearfully boards her flight returning to college
It is revealed that this was the last time Kat sees her father as he went out to a bar shortly thereafter and drunkenly admitted to murdering Eve
He is soon arrested and later hangs himself with a sheet in his jail cell also revealing that he moved Eve s body from the freezer the night before Kat unpacked it
The film ends with a flashback of Eve s death she came home from shopping the afternoon of her disappearance to find Brock and Phil in bed together
Phil dashed out of the room and Eve began laughing hysterically at Brock incredulous and he responded by wrapping his fingers around her throat asking her repeatedly to stop to which she kept on laughing and he strangled her to death

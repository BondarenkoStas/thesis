While a solar probe operated by the fictional Solar and Near Earth Laboratory is obtaining data a large CME or solar flare destroys the probe
A manned spacecraft Galileo is caught in the CME and destroyed the tragedy is blamed on bad Russian equipment
CMEs knock satellites out of orbit turning them into deadly meteors and a CME hits New Zealand destroying it and turning it into a huge mass of molten rock
After a multi millionaire Lucas Foster funds a program to fight global warming it is discovered that the Earth s atmosphere is now 5 percent methane
Multiple CMEs are bound to hit the Earth ignite the methane and suffocate every living thing on Earth
Foster who is also a scientist tries to convince his skeptical colleagues
The government officials and fellow scientist Joanna Parks his ex wife do not believe Foster either
As the CMEs strike it is determined that 25 megaton nuclear missiles fired at the North Pole will release vapor that will extinguish the methane flares
Fortunately Foster knows a Russian Navy submarine captain who reluctantly lets him board his submarine
Foster explains that although satellite communication has been disabled the submarine can communicate via a transatlantic telegraph cable located at a depth of 800m
The sub is designed to dive to 700m but the captain tells his reluctant lieutenant to dive to 800m anyway
The submarine survives the dive with minor damage
Communication between the captain and the Russian president results in the latter who has been informed of the situation by U S president Ryan Gordon telling the captain to go ahead with the plan
Meanwhile the Russian submarine has detected a U S Navy submarine
Before the Russian missiles can be launched a lieutenant threatens the captain at gunpoint but Foster wrestles the gun away
The Russian submarine is detected by the Americans who threaten to attack if the it does not surrender
The Russian captain launches the missiles anyway and the American submarine fires two torpedoes
The Russian submarine releases countermeasures that destroy the torpedoes but it still suffers damage
The Americans finally realize that the Russians are friendly after learning of the presence of Foster
The missiles arrive at the North Pole and the Earth is saved
At the end Foster and his ex wife hug Foster s comment about going down the aisle suggests that they may renew their romantic relationship and remarry

One of the tensions of this film set in France is between the film s present and the past
This tension is introduced when Marie mentions the scary children
Soon thereafter a child dies at the orphanage resulting in it being closed down save for a single orphan
Alluded to early in the movie things have gone terribly wrong in the past at the orphanage
The film leaves unresolved what happened in the past
This is because it was nothing unusual
An overworked under resourced institution in the shadow of World War II that was inundated with 300 children was unable to cope
Franchard poses the question How many do you think we could save
This tension is not what drives the film it provides context but not momentum The introduction of the character Anna starts the build up of this tension
What she sees and hears at the orphanage drives her to look and pry
She is primed for this by a brief single sentence exchange with Marie the orphan who is leaving the grounds
Anna is reinforced in her prying by her exchanges with Judith who also sees and hears things unaccountable by normal means despite the daily drug routine enforced by Helenka the cook and only other staff member on the grounds full time
Helenka does not appear to hear or see anything out of the ordinary and discourages Anna in her prying as does Franchard the director of the orphanage
This discouragement is simply that discouragement
Franchard and Helenka do not resort to subterfuge or violence to prevent Anna s nosing about
They see the past as a painful and sorrowful thing best left in the past
They show no sign of hiding anything criminal or otherwise odious
For them leaving the past alone is about moving on and forgetting the misery that was unavoidable Judith Franchard and Helenka were all present at the orphanage in 1946
The latter two discourage Anna the former encourages Anna and assists in her looking about
This sets up the basic tension of the film Sanity v Insanity
Both Franchard and Helenka are obviously well grounded people
No frivolity barely a smile to be had between them marks their demeanor
Judith must take drugs treats people irrationally and is the opposite of the stern Franchard and the stout Helenka
As Anna associates more with Judith she hears and sees more unusual things
In the end insanity wins the battle
This shows starkly when Anna descends from the dilapidated orphanage into a brightly lit well appointed and immaculate hospital ward in her pursuit of the scary children
This setting is so out of place in a building that has closed wings because of the inability to maintain them that it clearly signals the true nature of the scary children they are a product of the minds of those who see and hear them There is little to explain Anna s descent into insanity
The only clues are she was badly beaten by a former employer evidenced by the scars on her back and that she is pregnant
The father is not mentioned and although there is an insinuation she was impregnated by her former employer this in not made clear
That she does not want the baby is not really clear
She travels with a stethoscope and listens to the baby s heartbeat
That she is ashamed of being pregnant is clear
Upon discovering everyone at Saint Ange knows she is pregnant and knew before she arrived she punches herself in the stomach in an apparent but halfhearted attempt to abort the baby
Whatever her underlying mental state may have been when upon arrival at Saint Ange she clearly takes a turn while at Saint Ange
This is perhaps a nod to how weak our understanding of insanity is
There is little to say why she turns because there is so little understood about the insane

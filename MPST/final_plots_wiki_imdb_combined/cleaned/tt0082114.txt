An American captain wants to see the infamous bunker of Hitler
The Russian guard lets him head into the bunker
Water covers a good deal of the floors
Here is where Hitler lived his last 105 days Flashback
January 16 1945
The Americans are at the Rhine River in Germany
Hitler goes to his bunker in Berlin
Bormann checks the place out and comments What have we come to
Reports come in that the Russians are raping all German women
Goebbels arrives
Reichsminister Albert Speer Hitler s architect and industrial production man arrives
Speer wants to try to talk Hitler out of his plan to destroy all Germany
Speer gets his private audience but Hitler is absolutely committed to his plan of utter annihilation of Germany as a punishment for betraying him Speer talks with Dieter Stahl Chief of the Munitions Division about the possibility of assassinating Hitler by introducing into the bunker a new poison gas that is said to be able to penetrate any air filter
Stahl tells him that it is too risky of a gas and that mustard gas would be better
Speer asks Stahl to get him some of the gas and Stahl agrees Hitler is in conference with his generals
He is furious with them saying that the generals have let him down
One of the generals strenuously objects and the only thing that Hitler does to him is to tell him to go on six weeks of sick leave Bormann speaks with Speer and asks him why he has not carried out Hitler s plan for total annihilation of German towns and villages
Speer says that there have been administrative problems
He then has to speak with Hitler about the subject
Hitler tells him that he has read Speer s long memorandum on the subject but says there will be no reconsideration of his policy
He becomes extremely mad at Speer when the architect dares sits down How dare you sit in my presence
Speer is then dismissed
He later learns that he has been replaced with Bormann as head of the annihilation plan The next time Hitler speaks to Speer he tells him that he must believe that the war is not lost
But Speer says the war is lost
Then Hitler retreats a bit and says If you could just hope we will win that would be enough to satisfy me
Speer feeds Hitler some other lines and Hitler announces his victory with I knew I could rely on you Goebbels reports to Hitler that the American president Franlin Delano Roosevelt has died
The minister of propaganda is absolutely ecstatic
That happiness however is offset by the message that Vienna has fallen Eva Braun Hitler s mistress arrives
The head of the German Air Force Goering arrives followed by head of the secret police Himmler
Himmler is secretly negotiating with Count Bernadotte of Sweden about peace Berlin is now closed on three sides
Hitler tells his generals to send General Steiner in with his Panzer corps but Steiner only has 11 000 men
Hitler demands to know who was responsible for not stopping the Russians in their latest move
It s the 56th Panzer of General Wielding
Hitler tells his staff to have the general executed
Hitler goes outside and praises the kids who are now serving as German soldiers Goebbels calls his wife and tells her that the time has come
That is code for the situation is so bad that it is time to bring the children to the bunker to commit suicide with Hitler and Eva
The Goebbels believe that a world without Hitler would be simply unbearable Bormann asks Hitler to move to greater safety in Bavaria but Hitler answers with a definite no
Two of Hitler s secretaries come in to tell Hitler that they want to stay with him through the bombardments
Hitler nods in agreement
Magda Goebbels and her six children arrive Conferring again with his generals Hitler learns that General Steiner has been captured
Hitler goes into a rant saying that the army has betrayed him that his orders have not been carried out
He finally admits I ll die in Berlin
The war is lost
Eva Braun s brother in law Colonel Fegelein is brought by force into the bunker
The man has been absent for three days and was about to leave Berlin
Hitler chooses to be lenient and tells his staff to release him
But then Hitler is told that Himmler has offered to surrender the western German armies to Eisenhower
Hitler then even gets madder when he learns that Goering in a message to von Ribbentrop said that he will take over in Germany after Hitler s death
Speer has come to say good bye to Hitler because he is leaving but Hitler is too angry to give him much notice
But Hitler has time enough to tell Bormann to execute Fegelein Hitler and Eva Braun have afternoon tea and crumpets
Hitler is distracted with his worries so Eva asks him if they can tell the secretaries the good news
She gets the okay and she tells the women that they will be married
There is only about 48 hours left until the arrival of the Russians at the bunker Hitler asks General Mohnke who is in charge of the defence of Berlin if he can hold out until May 5 the anniversary of Napoleon s defeat
The general tells him that he can give no assurances as to any particular date There is a farewell dinner for Dr Goebbels
Hitler learns that Mussolini and his mistress have been executed and their bodies hung upside down in the public square The end has come
Hitler and Eva Braun say good bye to their staff
They then retire to their private chamber where they both bite down on cyanide capsules
Almost simultaneously Hitler shoots himself in the head with his revolver
Their bodies are taken outside the bunker and burned
Now it is the turn of the Goebbels
In their beds Magda makes all six children bite down on cyanide capsules
They are quickly dead
Magda and Joseph go outside and repeat the actions of Hitler and Eva Braun The staff now leaves the bunker with the exception of the engineer in charge of operating the electrical generator
Only six of the staff that left were able to avoid capture by the Russians
Two of Hitler s secretaries were captured by the British
Bormann s body was finally discovered in 1972 a suicide committed at the time of the fall of Berlin
Albert Speer was captured and served 20 years in prison

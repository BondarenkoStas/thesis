Act I Some time in the late 19th century Professor Abronsius and Alfred his young but bumbling sidekick arrive in a small Jewish shtetl somewhere in the Carpathians where they hope to prove the Professor s theory that vampires actually do exist
Naturally the villagers are in deep denial and refuse to confirm his beliefs
Nearly freezing to death in the nearby woods the two are taken in by Chagal an inkeeper who spends most of his free time lusting after Magda his beautiful chambermaid much to the disdain of his long suffering wife Rebecca
After exploring the rooms upstairs in which they are staying Alfred discovers and is smitten by Chagal s beautiful seventeen year old daughter Sarah
Chagal is very protective of his child going as far as boarding up her room so she wouldn t bathe around the two guests
That night Alfred and Sarah sing of their mutual attraction while Chagal does some more fooling around with the maid and Abronsius is swiftly knocked on the head by Chagal s wife
Unknown to Alfred late at night Sarah is serenaded by a mysterious stranger promising her eternal life and power
The next morning the Professor bears witness to a small business exchange between Chagal and Koukol a hideous hunchback living somewhere in the woods
He inquires about the odd man but Chagal refuses to discuss the matter
That same night Sarah tricks Alfred into giving up his bath for her and as she joyfully soaps her sponge Count von Krolock an aristocratic vampire breaks into the bathroom from the roof above and invites her to a midnight ball at his castle
He is about to bite the girl but Alfred who has been spying on Sarah s bathing ritual screams for help

She sneaks outside and discovers it to be a pair of expensive red boots
Alfred comes outside as well and professes his love to her

To their horror the two watch a whole mob of vampires rise up from a nearby church yard and head towards the ballroom

Setting Jade Empire takes place in a fictional kingdom inspired by ancient China
The game developers had a constructed language Tho Fan created for the game by Canadian linguist Wolf Wikeley
The language has been designed to sound ancient and distinctly Asian
Tho Fan does without the verb to be instead articles are used to mark tense
In the game the Tho Fan phrases do not actually match up to their on screen translations most of them are actually a set of a few dozen pre rendered phrases
In fact the game will often use exactly the same audio track to say successive sentences as also occurs in Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic
Story Chapter 1 Two Rivers The game begins with the player cast as a martial arts student under the tutelage of Master Li head of the Two Rivers martial arts school based in the Golden Delta

Endings If the student follows the Open Hand and chooses to free the Water Dragon s spirit then the end sequence shows the people of the Jade Empire cheering the student and their party
If the student follows the Closed Fist and chooses to enslave the Water Dragon the end sequence shows the Lotus Assassins kneeling at the feet of the student
After this end sequence there are short text summaries detailing the fate of any characters who survived the adventure
These vary depending on whether the student chose to enslave or free the Water Dragon and also on what romance options the student pursued
Dawn Star If the student chooses the path of the Open Hand then she either settles down with the student settles down on her own or rules the empire with the student

Sky Sky will use the Guild for good purposes or serve as the student s consort or as the new Death s Hand
If the student romances Sky they leave the imperial city and live on the outskirts of Tien s Landing unless the student is male in which case they continue on their adventures through the Jade Empire not content to settle down in one place

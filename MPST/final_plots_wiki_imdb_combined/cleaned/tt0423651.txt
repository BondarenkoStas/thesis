In Victorian London s Lant Street young Susan Trinder sells tickets to people wanting to take advantage of her home s view of a hanging
She is every bit as enthusiastic to see the hanging as any of them despite the fact that her own mother was reputedly hanged for murder
When the hanging happens she does not turn away from it as some of the watchers do Young Maud Lilly lives in an insane asylum in the English countryside where her mother died giving birth to her
One day she has a visitor in the form of an old man all in black the very sight of whom scares her so much that she screams
Later somewhat more composed she curiously asks him why his tongue is so black
Speaking to her as little as possible preferring to speak to her chaperone he explains that he is her uncle Mr Christopher Lilly and that he has come to take her into his home over her objections Susan lives with Mrs Sucksby who was paid to look after her for a week when she was a baby
Mrs Sucksby the den mother of a gang of criminals including Mr Ibbs John Vroom and Dainty is very fond of Susan and is particularly impressed by her skills as a pickpocket claiming that the girl will one day make their fortunes Despite Maud s objections she is brought to Briar her uncle s house
Told that Mr Lilly will require her to keep wearing her gloves Maud defiantly pulls them off and throws them away
Taken to her uncle s library she breaks another rule by stepping past a marker on the floor
Mr Lilly proceeds to slap her hand with another pair of gloves causing her pain
She puts on the gloves
He then explains that he has brought her here to be a secretary Years pass in an instant and Maud is now a young woman
Susan has also grown up into a full fledged member of the gang assisting Mrs Hawksby to care for the babies she s paid to watch out for and engaging in theft Mr
Lilly informs Maud that she s to be given lessons in painting by a young man who ll be attending a reading she s to give Mr Richard Rivers
Maud watches Rivers arrive
That night she gives a reading from what seems to be a very romantic novel and is complimented by her listeners Mr Hawtray and Mr Huss as well as Rivers
As the older men speak privately with her uncle Rivers speaks to Maud clearly flirting with her In Lant Street a man arrives at the home of Mrs Sucksby s gang
It is Rivers or Gentleman as he s known to them
He is in fact a con artist and thief
He describes the process by which he s been seducing Maud with the assistance of her agreeable maid
However the maid has been sent away which presents an impediment to his plans to get ahold of the large fortune left to Maud by her mother s will which she only gets when and if she marries something that her uncle is determined to prevent
To continue his plan he needs Sues help
She will become Maud s new maid and become her confidant persuading her to wed Rivers
He offers her two thousand pounds out of the forty thousand pounds that Rivers plans to steal from Maud and she bargains it up to three thousand Maud receives Sue s application to be her maid which comes with a recommendation from Rivers
He states that he fears that she will fall into crime if she s not given a new position Sue practices the skills she ll need to pose as Maud s maid
She asks Gentleman what s going to happen after he marries the girl and he explains that he ll arrange for her to be committed to a madhouse like her mother was
Sue finds that idea somewhat distasteful but Gentleman insists that the girl is half mad already Maud accepts Rivers recommendation in a touching letter that Gentleman mockingly reads aloud to the gang
The next day Sue makes her final preparations
She s very nervous wondering if this is going too far but Mrs Sucksby assures her that her mother would have done what she s doing without hesitation
Sue then wonders if she ll be hanged if she s caught
Mrs Sucksby tries to lie about this but then finally admits it but claims that when they hang women they use a special noose that makes for a quicker death and anyway Susans going to make them all rich
This is the first time that she and Susan have ever been parted and Susan thinks that Mrs Hawksby is taking it worse than she is It s also the first time Sue has ever been out of the city and she s amazed at how much country there is
She arrives at Briar late at night and is taken to her room
She s led past a door behind which can be heard sobs moans and faint screams
She s sufficiently unnerved that if she d known how to get out of the house she d have run
But the next morning when she s introduced to Maud her confidence is restored
Maud first checks to see whether Sue can read and determines that she can t
Susan embarrassedly asks if she s to be taught and Maud surprises her by saying that she envies her for not being able to do it
She then tells Sue to put her things in order and collect her from the library in the afternoon Later Sue s bags are brought to her room by a simple minded servant named Charles whom she impresses by giving him a small tip
Then she walks into Maud s bedroom which adjoins hers and examines the remarkable luxury in which her new mistress lives
She examines a drawer filled with pearl buttoned gloves and then picks a lock to look in a jewelry box finding the cameo of Maud s mother
Hearing the chief maid coming Sue quickly shifts her focus to trying to put Maud s things in order
The chief maid Mrs Stiles tells her to give the stubs of the candles from the night before to the steward and that she may keep the left over pieces of soap that Maud uses
Sue virtuously declines comparing this to thieving Sue goes to the library to collect Maud and almost crosses over the forbidden line
That evening she builds up a fire somewhat to Maud s distress as Mrs Stiles apparently keeps a very detailed account of coal and wood
Sue tells her that she ll tell them that they re compensating by burning the candles down to the wick and assures her that she knows how to handle people like Mrs Stiles
As Sue begins to undress her Maud apologizes for not having warned her about the line that she almost crossed in the library but Sue brushes it off with a laugh which makes Maud laugh as well
Sue also politely compliments one of Maud s paintings which the painter herself thinks is terrible
She asks Sue about Rivers and Sue passes on Rivers compliments saying that he looks forward to seeing her at the end of the month
Maud then asks whether Sue considers Rivers to be handsome and Sue evasively answers that her previous employer considers him to be one of the most handsome men in London
After Sue helps her put on a nightgown Maud states that she thinks Rivers is a good man which opinion Sue is quick to support Later Sue is awakened by the moans from Maud s room and rushes to see what s the matter
It turns out that Maud can only sleep if she has a sleeping drug and needs someone else to pour it for her
Otherwise she has terrible nightmares
Maud asks Sue to sleep in the same bed as her and while she initially refuses she does so that night and every night thereafter On another day Sue collects Maud from the library silently pointing out the way that she s carefully staying behind the line
As they leave the house arm in arm they begin to laugh at how funny it all seems
Later Sue files down Maud s fingernails so that they don t damage her gloves
They are always together like the sisters neither of them has ever had
Sue comes to realize that Maud isn t crazy as Gentleman said that she was but just repressed by the horrible place where she lives and the way that she does so missing out on so much of life s simple pleasures Maud gives Susan some of her own dresses
Later Sue does a fake fortune telling for Sue reflecting on how different the future that she and Gentleman are going to inflict on her from the rosy future she describes
In the process she makes a mistake dropping the card which indicates love on the floor
Maud then asks Sue to tell her about London in particular the sort of dances that they do and as Sue goes to clear a space so that she can show her Maud picks up the love card Later the two women dance together to a waltz
Maud hopes to become better at it in London and Sue reflects that Gentleman won t care how well Maud dances Later yet Sue helps to treat one of Maud s wisdom teeth and caresses Maud s face for the first time
As she does so a carriage pulls up outside the house with Rivers in it
Sue realizes that she s feeling happy to be with Maud and that she hates Gentleman for ruining it
Meanwhile Maud frantically wonders whether she can possibly receive Rivers in her current state and Sue feels a desire to tell her the truth but thinks that Maud would never believe her Rivers arrives in the sitting room and compliments the woman who is standing with her back to him looking out through the window
She turns around it s Sue not Maud
Maud is off to one side
They engage in small talk with innuendoes passed between Sue and Rivers That night Rivers works in the library with Mr Lilly who tells him that he expects the job for which Rivers has been hired to be done within three weeks
Rivers assures him that it will be Rivers spends a week teaching Maud how to paint still life and another teaching her to paint landscapes both without notable success
He compliments her painting saying how much he d like to bring her and her work to his gallery in London
Speaking privately to Sue he implies that Maud is nearly seduced Later in a tete a tete with Sue Gentleman asks her whether Maud talks about him and is told that she talks of nothing else
She suggests that he simply propose and get it over with but he thinks that would frighten her off
But they re running out of time and he relies on Sue to convince Maud that she s in love with him violently reminding her of how much money is at stake On another day Maud is painting a view of the river that runs past the house while Sue dozes against a boat
When Sue wakes up she finds herself alone and starts looking for them finding them standing by a tree
Rivers pulls off one of Maud s gloves and begins to kiss her hand
Sue watches this with a decidedly jealous look and is seen by Rivers who gives her a triumphant grin
Later he tells her that Maud has been hooked but it is up to Sue to finish the job It starts to rain and Sue and Maud run for the shelter of a tree
Startled by thunder Maud clings to Sue and tells her that Rivers has asked for her hand in marriage
Sue feigns enthusiasm for the prospect but Maud guesses that she s not pleased
Sue claims that she s just surprised but that she is pleased as well
Maud then reveals that she hasn t accepted the proposal as she thinks her uncle would never let her go
Rivers has apparently suggested that they elope and marry in a small church nearby
Before she can go further she s startled and clings to Sue a second time Sometime later Rivers sneaks into a room where Maud is continuing to paint and surprises her with an embrace which she backs away from while Susan looks on in dismay
He offers Sue a coin to go off to another room and leave him alone with Maud and while she thinks about taking it she refuses
This angers Rivers but he says nothing then Later though he surprises Sue in a hallway asking her what she thinks she s doing
She just tells him to keep his hands off of Maud as she doesn t like to be touched
Rivers pushes her up against the wall and tells her that Maud is practically crying out for it
Sue claims all that Maud wants is to leave this place and she doesn t think it right that she should do so only to end up in a madhouse
Grabbing her by the throat Rivers threatens to cut Sue out of the deal entirely
When Sue threatens to reveal his plans he reminds her that she s been in on them from the beginning Maud paces in front of a seated Sue trying to make her mind up as to whether she should accept the proposal
Sue tells her that she should follow her heart if she loves Rivers
But Maud claims that she isn t sure if she does
Sue describes what she imagines love feels like but Maud apparently doesn t feel anything like that
Realizing this Sue blurts that Maud should say no
Maud is very startled by this advice and points out that if she does that she ll always wonder what would have happened if she did
Reflecting on what Mrs Sucksby told her about her mother remembering the money Sue tells Maud that Rivers does love her and that she should trust in that
Maud says that she ll agree but only if Sue comes with them Rivers makes arrangements for the ceremony with an old woman in the church and also arranges to stay at her cottage after the wedding The wedding is two days away to be held at midnight
On the night before they are to flee Maud watches Sue undress and then dress for bed
After Sue climbs into bed with her Maud asks her if she knows what married people do on their wedding night
Horrified by the question Sue futilely pretends to be asleep
Maud claims that she knows some things from books but Sue is aghast at that idea which embarrasses Maud further
She wants to know what s going to happen and Sue claims that it ll probably start with a kiss on the lips
Maud is dubious as Rivers kisses have never done much for her and Sue offers to demonstrate
She kisses Maud on the lips and then again and again and again
Maud agrees that that was nice but that it lacks something
Sue suggests that what it lacks is Rivers but Maud doesn t think so
Holding Maud s hand Sue insists that the other girl will have to do it sometime and they realize that she s still wearing the gloves
Sue slowly pulls them off and they begin to kiss again slowly lying down
Sue runs her hand down Maud s body sliding it under the covers
They make love
Sue calls Maud a pearl The next morning Sue wakes up before Maud
She seems startled by what happened
Maud wakes up saying that she had a wonderful night s sleep without any drugs and not a single nightmare only a very pleasant dream
Sue was in it
Sue reminds Maud about her impending nuptials and hurriedly gets out of bed Rivers is having his things packed up and taken out to a cart
He looks up at Maud s window expecting to see her there
In her room Sue has dressed and coiffed Maud
Maud goes to the window and looks out at Rivers
Looking back on it Sue reflects that if she d told Maud that she loved her then Maud would have said it back and all the bad things that were going to happen wouldn t have
But she said nothing
They start to pack up her things and then go out to see Rivers off That night Sue offers to give Maud back the dress that she gave her so that she can be married in it
Maud refuses the offer
Sue takes a look at the painting that Maud did on the day that Rivers proposed noting an odd red stain
Sue reflects that it would be so easy to tell Maud the truth about Rivers even though it would probably have resulted in her being locked up
She thinks about the mockery she d endure on Lant Street if it got out that she was in love with a girl
She steps out to check on the weather Coming back in she s surprised by Mr Lilly whos just now leaving the library and locking it up behind him
He barely notices her At fifteen minutes to midnight Rivers is waiting in a boat on the river
Sue goes to get the bags and picks up one of Maud s gloves as a keepsake
She then heads out into the hallway but Maud is nowhere to be seen
She finds her doing something to the library door and they both begin to make their way out of the house
A noise wakes up her Mr Lilly but Maud sends him back to bed by simply saying that it s just her
They escape the house and head down the hill to join Rivers in the boat The wedding ceremony is held with Sue giving Maud away
She notes that the ring is just as bad as everything else about the affair as Gentleman hasn t even bothered to get a golden band After the wedding they head for a cottage where Sue starts to prepare Maud for her wedding night
Sue can t even bring herself to look at Maud as the clothes come off but after a nightgown is slid on over her head Maud tells her to look at her
As Sue does Maud kisses her presses Sue s hands to her own body and asks her if it wasnt a dream
Rivers peeks in through the door but backs away
Maud pushes Sue to the bed and they frantically make love The next day Rivers comes to Sue s room and tells her that Maud wants her to come and dress her
He boasts that having discovered the meaning of true love Maud is now half way to the madhouse
As the old woman who owns the cottage comes into hearing he puts up a false front of concern for Maud s well being
Sue goes to Maud s room finding Maud seated in a chair with a very unhappy expression and a blood stain on the bedsheets Sue takes the bedding out to be washed
The old woman inquires as to Maud s well being and Sue spins the tale that Rivers concocted about Maud being on the verge of madness
Maud comes to the window and watches them talking but it s not clear whether she can hear Sue gossiping in this way or not
The old woman becomes apprehensive about a dangerous mad woman staying in her cottage but Sue calms her down Later Maud asks Rivers why they can t go to London and is told that she s not well enough to travel
She insists that she is and that she hates it here
The old woman brings in a breakfast
Maud thinks that the old woman doesn t like her and she doesn t like the old woman either
She s afraid but Rivers insists that there s nothing to be afraid of For the next week Sue narrates Maud eats practically nothing and takes more and more drops to help her sleep
She apparently thinks that if she does this Rivers won t want her
In fact she s doing exactly what he does want putting herself into a state where she ll be exactly what he wants the madhouse doctors to see
He sends them a letter The only pleasure that Maud finds is dressing Sue in her old gowns and jewelry
While doing so they have a moment where they seem to be on the verge of recapturing their former intimacy but they re interrupted by the sound of a carriage approaching
Sue looks out the window and confirms that it s the doctors but she tells Maud that it s some friends of Rivers from London whove come to meet her
Maud is surprised as if she didn t realize that they d be coming that afternoon
Maud doesn t want to receive them and Rivers asks Sue to step outside for a moment Outside Sue asks Gentleman not to let the doctors hurt Maud
He scoffs at this saying that she is money to these men but that unless they agree to take her away today they won t do it at all
He asks Sue if she knows how to answer their questions and she hints that she might not do so
Gentleman tells her not to mess things up now when they re so close to success
Inside the doctors are speaking with the old woman who owns the cottage and look out at Gentleman and Sue
He asks her if she wants to go back to Mrs Sucksby with nothing He brings her in to speak with the doctors who explain that theyd like to ask her a few questions about Rivers marriage
Sue interjects to say that he s married to her mistress
The doctors inquire as to whom she means when she talks about her mistress and she refers to Mrs Rivers the former Miss Lilly
They nod and ask Sue to tell them about herself
She does so confused about their interest in her
After describing her background she says that she s concerned for her mistress welfare and breaks into tears as she begs the doctors to make sure that her mistress is in a safe place
They assure her that they ll take good care of her and that she s very lucky to have such a faithful servant Watching through a window Sue sees the doctors tell Gentleman that they agree that it s a very serious case and that they ll send the carriage to pick her up tomorrow Later Rivers comes into Maud s bedroom where she s lying in bed while Sue watches over her and tells her that she looks a little better
Tomorrow he claims they ll be going to London
She s startled by this and he promises that she ll be going to a fine house with quiet rooms and good servants The next day Maud insists that Sue go on wearing the same gown that she wore yesterday
Going through her luggage Sue finds the glove that she took as a keepsake and puts it inside her dress to hold it close to her heart
Then all three head out and step into the back of the carriage thats been sent for them
It heads off down the road They arrive at the madhouse and Maud looks out through a window apprehensively
When they arrive at the front door the doctor opens up the back door and greet Mr Rivers Miss Smith Mrs Rivers
It takes Sue a moment to realize that he has just addressed her
A moment later Rivers forces her out the door and into the arms of the doctors despite her protests that she s Susan Smith
They tell her that the place she s given as an address doesn t exist
She screams profanity at Gentleman and then sees the hostile expression on Maud s face
Maud speaks in a variation on Sue s accent referring to her as her mistress and now Sue realizes exactly how much she s been betrayed
Maud hasn t ever been the victim of a con Sue has and Maud has been in on it with Gentleman
She screams and fights Maud looking on reflects that Sue thought that she knew her thought her an innocent
But she wasnt she knew everything and nothing
To explain what happened the story returns to the first night that Rivers came to Briar
The book that Maud reads from is not a romantic tale but is a piece of erotica that describes a rape complete with an explicit drawing which she exhibits to the listeners
Mr Lilly is a collector and connoisseur of erotica a self described curator of poisons who has exposed Maud to it from the age of twelve so that she can be his librarian and later his eyes as well
That night Rivers continues to try and flatter Maud but she s unmoved by his compliments Later as she s in her bed she sees him lurking outside her window
A note is slipped under her door informing her that they need to talk about her mother s will
Maud lets Rivers into her room
She informs him that she doesn t do the sorts of things she reads about and he responds thats not what interests him
He explains to her the true terms of her mothers will that she ll receive forty thousand pounds if and when she marries
He claims that he came to seduce her and steal her fortune but having met her he realizes that it would be an insult to try
Instead he wants to free her
Uncomfortable with his presence Maud orders him to leave and he does so The next day Maud is walking on the estate and Rivers rides up on a horse and proposes marriage without even bothering to get down from the horse
She s upset by his effrontery and walks off
Leaving the horse in Charles care Rivers follows Maud and promises that he will not attempt intimacy with her and that they can part after the ceremony
All he wants is half of her fortune Maud thinks this idea is absurd and that her uncle would never permit it
Rivers plan is to make Mr Lilly think that Maud has been put into a madhouse while actually putting someone else there in her stead
A new maid will be installed someone who thinks that she s tricking Maud but who will be tricked herself
The idea makes Maud physically sick but looking out at the rising sun over the river imagining herself free of Briar it is very tempting The next day Rivers continues to push the idea on Maud saying that they will never have another opportunity like this
She still thinks the idea of tricking a girl like this is despicable
Rivers tells her that the girl he has in mind is a thief who would willingly do what they re planning to Maud
Maud still walks away Maud is working in the library when Rivers comes in walks past the line on the floor without even slowing down pulls open the drapes that keep the room dim and throws open a window all over Maud s protests
He tells her that she belongs out there not locked up with these books
Maud closes the window and tells him to go But she s accepted the plan
The first obstacle to the plan is the presence of Maud s current maid Agnes who keeps a close eye on the two of them during Maud s lessons in painting
She cannot dismiss her and so Rivers seduces Agnes
The two of them are caught in the hallway by Mrs Stiles and Agnes is sent away in disgrace leaving the way open for a new maid
Maud is shaken by what s been done but her background doesn t allow her to feel that way for too long
When the new maid Sue arrives it s with a recommendation that informs Maud that this is the girl who will be put in the madhouse in her place reminding her that Sue has to be taught to imitate Maud and vice versa Maud is initially contemptuous of Sue whose lower class origins and lack of refinement are made very obvious as they eat breakfast one day and thinks that Sue has only come to be her betrayer
But she becomes used to Sue and realizes when they do the fortune telling that Sue is a real person with human weaknesses
But in order to escape from Briar she is willing to trick and hate Sue One day while they are practicing dancing a note comes to tell Maud that Rivers is coming tomorrow
This is what prompts Maud to dress Sue in her dresses
She realizes looking at Sue in the dress that Sue is beautiful and has to keep reminding herself that Sue thinks Maud is going to be the one who ll end up in the madhouse in order to continue with the plan But Sue s presence has changed so much in Maud s life
She starts to find meaning in the words in her uncle s books
She watches Sue as the latter sleeps reaching out to almost touch her but not quite managing it Painting by the riverside with Rivers in attendance Maud becomes fascinated with the sight of Sue asleep
Rivers reminds Maud that time is of the essence if they want to continue with their plan and that they have to convince Sue that they re in love
But Maud can t take her eyes off of Sue and Rivers notices this when she lets red paint drip onto the landscape that she s making
He grabs her and drags her away to the side of a nearby tree and mocks her for being in love with Sue claiming that Sue would be disgusted and revolted by her affection
Unless Maud wants to remain in Briar forever she has to put up a false front of loving Rivers to fool Sue
Hearing Sue calling for her Maud agrees to the pretense and the scene that Sue witnesses with Rivers kissing her ungloved hand is an elaborate deception What s not a deception is what happens between Maud and Sue that night
But Maud thinks that Sue is ashamed of what happened between them and takes this as proof that Sue s feelings are false just another part of the trap that Sue is creating for Maud
So she decides to go ahead with the plan to use Sue to escape and then abandon her in a madhouse There is one more thing she needs to do before she can escape
Maud creeps into her uncle s bedroom and steals a razor from his nightstand
Entering the library she uses the razor to vandalize his collection of erotica destroying as much of it as she can
Then she leaves with Sue At the cottage after the ceremony Rivers comes into Maud s bedroom and tells her that they need to do something to complete the illusion
She thinks he means to rape her but in fact what he wants to do is leave a bloodstain on the bedding cutting himself to produce the blood
He coarsely asks her if she s having her period as it would make it a lot easier on him
Angered by this she offers to let him cut her instead
He finally does cut himself A week later when the doctors come to see them Rivers presents Maud to them as Susan his wife s maid
She begins telling them about the stories her mistress has been making up ever since her wedding night
The doctor comments that it s only to be expected from a woman who reads so much as Maud does
Rivers breaks into the discussion to describe the unnatural things that his wife has subjected her poor maid to and Maud breaks down in tears likely at the realization that what she hoped was private is known to him The next day she allows Susan to be dragged away to the madhouse even though it breaks her heart
As they are driven away from the madhouse Rivers compliments her on her performance and she tells him to shut up or she ll kill him
She pulls off the wedding ring and throws it to the floor
Rivers picks it up as she pulls on her gloves In the madhouse Sue is being dragged around by female guards protesting that she s been tricked
Continuing to address her as Mrs Rivers the doctor tells her to stop lying and she spits at him
The guards strip off her clothes and assault her Maud and Rivers arrive in London
Looking in her purse Maud finds the love card she picked up much earlier and is reminded of Sue
Rivers blandly assures her that Sue is much better off where she is than where she came from
The carriage brings them to Lant Street which is definitely not what Maud expected
Rivers explains that they cannot live grandly until the lawyer agrees to give them the money
He brings her to the house of Mrs Sucksby and introduces her as Mrs Maud Rivers
Mrs Sucksby is visibly fascinated by her reaching out to touch her face though Maud backs away from the familiarity
Mrs Sucksby congratulates Gentleman on his success In the padded room of the asylum Sue remembers talking with Maud and throws the glove to the floor in anger
What keeps her alive is the thought that Mrs Sucksby will find her and then Sue will find and kill Maud Back in London Maud realizes that this is where Sue lived and that the people there are her band of crooks
She understands that she has been tricked and tells Gentleman to get her a cab or she ll get a policeman
None of the thieves take this threat seriously
Maud tries to run away but they grab her luggage and John Vroom holds her at knife point
Maud responds to this by grabbing one of the babies that Mrs Sucksby cares for and threatens to kill it if she s not released
Mrs Sucksby calmly tells her that she can do so as it makes no difference to her if she s caring for seven babies or for six or even five
Maud hands over the baby and is taken to sit by the fire In the asylum Sue has been put in with the other prisoners
The guards use them as unpaid domestics and threaten to put one of them Mrs Frobisher in a painful looking restraint if she doesn t stop singing hymns
Mrs Frobisher asks her if she s out or in and Sue says that she s very much in
This strikes the guards as hilarious and they tell her that if she keeps telling the truth like that she might just get out of there In London Maud wakes up having slept in a chair to see that Mrs Sucksby has apparently been watching her sleep
Mrs Sucksby assures her that they mean her no harm
Maud can t imagine that they mean her well if they won t let her leave
Mrs Sucksby is very impressed with Maud s grammar and asks some questions about how her uncle treated her
Gentleman explains that this whole affair has actually been orchestrated by Mrs Sucksby and Mrs Sucksby claims that they knew about Maud s fortune from Maud s mother
Maud doesn t believe this as she knows that she was born in an asylum
Mrs Sucksby tells her that isn t true
She was born in Lant Street As Mrs Sucksby tells it Marianne Lilly ran away from Briar when she was pregnant and ended up in Mrs Sucksby s care as she gave birth
When her father and brothers came to take her back Mary Anne gave her daughter a plain name Susan
Marianne begged Mrs Sucksby to keep her daughter and raise her rather than letting her be taken with her back to Briar
So Mrs Sucksby gave her another child to take back with her one who d been born on the same day as Marianne s child Maud
Stunned by these revelations Maud faints In the asylum Sue is allowed out into the yard to exercise and confides her true name to one of the inmates who believes her
However the guard tells her the woman also believes that there are creatures on the moon
This drives Sue into a rage and she starts fighting the guards again In London Maud wakes up from her faint
Mrs Sucksby gives her brandy
Maud still doesn t believe what she s been told reflecting back to her origins in a madhouse
Gentleman claims that Marianne s father and brothers preferred the madhouse to the disgrace of having an unwed mother on their hands and that she didn t go insane until she ended up there In the asylum Sue is being subjected to water punishment tied to a board and immersed in freezing water
She decides that she really is mad In London Gentleman and Mrs Sucksby are having an argument about Maud when she comes downstairs and asks who her mother actually was
Mrs Sucksby claims that she doesn t know as Maud was a foundling
Now Maud wants to know if Marianne was Sue s mother how does Maud have a fortune
Mrs Sucksby explains that Marianne divided the inheritance between Maud and Sue to be awarded to them on their twenty first birthday which is only a month away and shows her a letter that proves it
Mrs Sucksby s plan is to get all of that money with Gentleman only receiving three thousand pounds
Maud says that she won t sign anything and Sue can t as she s in the madhouse
But their plain is for Maud to go on impersonating Sue and Gentleman posing as the husband of the mad Maud will sign for her
Maud guesses that she ll be killed after she signs but Mrs Sucksby claims that she s one of the gang now
She wants Maud to teach her how to be a lady so that she can enjoy her money
Maud continues to refuse and Gentleman points out that since the woman imprisoned is thought to be the real Maud she has no name or identity if she doesn t use Sue s
She has no real choice
And he adds if she thinks her life with money was hard she should really try living without In the asylum two weeks after being subjected to the water punishment Sue is prepared to be whoever the doctors want her to be if theyll only let her out
She keeps hoping that Mrs Sucksby will come to rescue her but remembers her advice about telling people what they want to hear
So she poses as Mrs Rivers for the doctor saying how much she wants to see her husband and her poor maid again
However he tests her by making her write her name and she can t write Maud s name
So they still think she s mad but assure her that once she can write her own name her husband will be there to sign her out
Knowing that Gentleman will never do so Sue despairs In London Maud thinks about what she s done to Sue as Mrs Sucksby counts down the days to her twenty first birthday
She wants to escape and get to Sue In the asylum Sue is given food only if she answers to Mrs Rivers In London Maud asks Dainty about Sue
Dainty thinks that Sue turned out bad but she did like her before that
Maud remembers dancing with Sue walking with Sue and then she comes up with an escape plan
Faking a stomach illness she gets Dainty to take her to the privy
There she claims that she s bleeding badly and sends Dainty to get help
Once Dainty leaves Maud quickly runs away into the streets of London Maud asks for help from a passing cab and tells the gentleman inside that she needs to go to a hotel
He lets her in but then begins to make advances to her as they drive along
When he tries to restrain her she bites him and jumps out of the cab then runs away
She avoids people after that
She runs through the streets her slippers tearing her feet bleeding until she comes to the only street in London that she knows the one where Mr Hawtray has a bookstore
Maud bursts in and goes to speak with him asking him for help
Mr Hawtray is very startled to see her In the asylum Sue is told that Mrs Rivers has a visitor
She goes to see whos looking for her
Her visitor is Charles the servant she tipped earlier though it takes her a while to recognize him
He s confused by the references to her as Mrs Rivers but she manages to keep him quiet with a kiss
She uses him to confirm her identity as Sue but tells him to call her Mrs Rivers and asks him about Briar
Charles tells her that Mr Lilly had a stroke the night she and Maud ran away
After that Charles was so cruelly treated by the houses steward that he ran away
He hoped to find help from Mr Rivers who was very kind to him before and came to the madhouse because his aunt told him that Mrs Rivers was there
She asks him to bring her a blank key and a file when he visits her again and he agrees In London Mr Hawtray refuses to let Maud stay at his house as he has a wife and family who know nothing of his illegal activities as a bookseller and publisher who deals in erotica
She offers to work for him as a proofreader demonstrating her ability but he refuses that as well
He can t help her in any real way With no other options Maud returns to Lant Street
Mrs Sucksby tries to embrace her but Maud continues to pull away
Mrs Sucksby finally tells her the truth Maud is her own daughter not a foundling In the asylum Charles brings Sue the things that she asked for and she tells him to come to the wall around the asylum at a certain time
In the dorm that night Sue causes a mild disturbance that allows her to be the one to be entrusted with the keys and made to rub the guards hands with some cream
She makes an impression of the key to the dormitory door in the cream and then after the guards are asleep quietly files the blank key so that it matches the blank
She sneaks out of the dormitory and though Mrs Frobisher sees her opening the door she doesn t alert the guards
Sue goes to the wall and finds Charles fast asleep on the ground below
Without his help she s forced to drop to the ground cutting herself on her forehead
She kicks Charles until he wakes up and they run off together
She thinks of the look on Mrs Sucksby s face when she arrives and she thinks of Maud wherever she is Maud is proceeding with her impersonation of Sue
She tries on Sue s bangles and carries a small wallet in which she keeps the love card
Seeing it she s reminded again of Sue and starts to cry In the countryside Sue burglarizes a cottage getting food and clothes for the trip to London
She also steals a watch simply because she can
While Charles is horrified by this she claims that it s the first time she s ever done anything like that
She finds the glove again and stomps on it
Sue also promises Charles that she ll get Mr Rivers to go back to the cottage and pay for everything that she took
This comforts him and they rest together under a tree In London Maud brings Mrs Sucksby a cup of tea and asks her about her father
He was a sailor with whom Mrs Sucksby had an affair Sue and Charles have arrived in London
She exults in the stench of it reclaiming her real name for the first time since she left
Making her way to Lant Street with Charles she tries to go to her old home where she sees Mr Ibbs talking with a fellow fingersmith named Tommy Joslin
Before she can go to them Sue sees Maud in the house and almost breaks down in tears Mrs
Sucksby tells Maud happy birthday Sue shows Charles the watch that she stole and finally tells him the whole truth about herself and Mr Rivers
Just as she s doing so she spots Gentleman walking down the street to the house Gentleman walks in and mockingly greets Maud to Mrs Sucksby s anger
He goes to call a cab Sue tells Charles to go to the house and deliver a message to Mrs Sucksby taking the watch with him
He gives the watch to Mr Ibbs and then sees Maud there Charles comes back to Sue and tells her that he gave the message to Maud who sent back the love card as a reply
Sue takes this as a taunt tears the card up and storms into the house with a knife confronting the gang
They believe that she abandoned the plan to steal some jewelry and got caught Sue believes that this is what Maud told them unaware that it s the story invented by Mrs Sucksby herself
Maud tries to get Sue to leave as she s in danger but Sue isn t in any mood to hear it
Her angry responses anger Maud and Sue runs screaming at Maud with a knife
John Vroom and Mrs Sucksby stop them and John gets hit on the head by Mrs Sucksby for his troubles
He threatens her but her attention is on Sue
She claims that she had no idea what was going to happen to Sue that she s been tricked by Gentleman At that point Gentleman arrives
Mrs Sucksby tells him to leave as she s outraged by what Sue has just told her
Gentleman starts to leave but Sue demands that he remain
Mrs Sucksby backs her up but starts to take the knife away from her
Gentleman disgusted by all this tells her to tell Sue the truth
Maud tells him to shut up and he finally notices the resemblance between her and Mrs Sucksby and realizes the truth and reveals it
In the confused melee that follows Sue Maud and Mrs Sucksby are all pushed up against Gentleman and he is stabbed with the knife
It s not clear who was holding it
Gentleman drops to the ground bleeding to death and begging for a surgeon
Charles runs off screaming murder while the others watch him die A policeman confirms that Gentleman is dead and asks who did this
John Vroom takes vengeance on Mrs Sucksby by accusing her and while Maud tries to claim responsibility no one is interested in hearing her after Mrs Sucksby confesses
It turns out that Gentleman is actually a drapers son named Frederick Bunt
Maud disappears
Mrs Sucksby is sentenced to hang for the crime Sue visits Mrs Sucksby in gaol noting that the older woman expects her to be with someone else but she comes alone
Mrs Sucksby asks her to watch as she s hung and to remember her fondly if she hears bad things about her after she s dead
Sue tearfully agrees Walking with Dainty Sue s given some money by Tommy Joslin that has been collected in sympathy for Mrs Sucksby s troubles Maud comes to visit Mrs Sucksby in gaol and asks her to tell the police the truth that it was Maud who stabbed Gentleman
Mrs Sucksby refuses claiming to view this as her punishment for what she did to Maud and Sue
She asks Maud to never tell Sue the truth about what happened and Maud agrees
Maud says that she really came to see Mrs Sucksby before the end and though she initially still recoils from her touch she presses a kiss to the old womans hand and calls her mother Mrs
Sucksby is hanged
Sue watches and doesn t turn away Later Sue collects Mrs Sucksby s effects from the gaol including a shirt on which her scent still lingers
She breaks down in tears and is comforted by Dainty who takes the shirt and discovers Mariannes letter hidden in the collar
As neither of them can read they turn to Tommy Joslin who reads it out to them revealing the truth about Sue and Maud s origins
For the first time in ages Sue remembers Maud with something like fondness Having heard that Mr Lilly has died Sue returns to Briar in hopes of finding some clue to Maud s whereabouts
She walks through the empty house and arrives at the library finding Maud there busily writing at a desk and with ink stains on her face
Maud s first question is to ask whether Sue has come to kill her
Sue says no and steps past the line
Sue claims that she knows everything now but Maud tells her that she doesn t
She stands up and picks up a book reading an erotic passage aloud to Sue
Sue stops her looks at the book and asks if all the books in the library are like that
Maud says they are and that she writes books like them to support herself
Maud thinks Sue must hate her
Sue is startled by this and claims that she doesn t
Maud brokenly apologizes for what she did to Sue and Sue reflects that they were both tricked producing the letter
Maud tells her that the money is hers if she wants it but all Sue wants to know is if Maud knew who Sue s mother was before all this
Maud tells her that she didn t and that Mrs Sucksby didn t want her to know
She confesses that she killed Gentleman
Sue cleans off the ink stains on Maud s face causing her to knock papers to the floor
Sue asks what they say Maud answers words saying how I want you how
I love you
They kiss

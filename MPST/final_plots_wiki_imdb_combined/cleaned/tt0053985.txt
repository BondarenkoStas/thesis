Kalidas is presented before court for the murder of Ganpat
He pleads guilty but claims that the court can do him no harm as he has already served a sentence for the murder of the same man
An emotionally overcharged Kalidas asks judge Badri Prasad what gives law the right to deprive an innocent man of something it cannot return him before collapsing and dying
The shocking incident makes its way to the press and becomes a matter of hot debate in the city
Two judges Mr Jha and Mr Savalkar discuss the case
Badri Prasad who is well known for never having awarded a death sentence has a friendly argument with Jha which leads to a wager that it is possible for someone to get away scot free with murder
In the meanwhile romance is blossoming between Badri Prasad s daughter Meena and advocate Kailash Khanna one of the rising stars in the legal fraternity and Badri Prasad s protégé
The young couple s visit to a ballet is rather unremarkable except for the surreptitious appearance of Ashok Kumar who is seen by the viewer romancing an unknown lady in a private box
Incidentally the murdered man Ganpat is her husband
She married a rich man during her first husband s lifetime and inherited his property
This was an illegal marriage and Dhaniram was blackmailing her as he was privy to this information
Badri Prasad s son Vijay is heavily indebted to a local money lender Dhaniram who having obtained the former s signature on a blank piece of paper threatens to have his entire property confiscated
Afraid to face his stern father with the truth Vijay pleads with Kailash to intercede with the money lender
The later agrees to do so despite initial reluctance
Kailash drops in at the money lender s place to have a word with him
Their exchange is interrupted by the arrival of Badri Prasad s look alike
Kailash does not want to be seen with Dhaniram so he hides in a sideroom instructing Dhaniram not to disclose to the judge that he had come there
Dhaniram receives the unexpected guest through an already open door
Kailash watches in horror from the inner room as the unscheduled visitor stabs his host to death
Unsure what to do Kailash walks away
Unfortunately a petty thief Kaalia who comes in with the intention of burglary is apprehended at the scene of the crime and presented in Badri Prasad s court
He is shown being caught by Sub Inspector Das and Hawildar Ram Singh
Kaalia s hands are completely drenched in blood
Torn between his loyalty to his mentor and future father in law on the one hand and his moral duty to save an innocent man on the other Kailash resolves to defend the accused while at the same time avoiding bringing out in public the painful truth
What ensues is an absorbing psychological thriller with an unexpected end

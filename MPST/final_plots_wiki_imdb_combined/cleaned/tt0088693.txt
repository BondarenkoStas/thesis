The incredible all star version of the unforgettable tale Sometimes she s too big
Or much too small
Sometimes things are backwards
And there s always too much pepper in the soup
Nothing is quite right since Alice chased a very unusual White Rabbit and stumbled into an adventure that grows curiouser and curiouser
One of the greatest childhood fantasies is captured in Irwin Allen s colorful production adapted from Lewis Carroll s Alice s Adventures in Wonderland
The stellar cast features dozens of Hollywood s biggest names including Red Buttons Sammy Davis Jr and Beau Bridges
The legendary Steve Allen wrote the jolly witty songs
Alice is looking for a way home
And happy to be welcomed into yours

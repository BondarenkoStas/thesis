Legend has that in the abandoned medieval town of Berzano at the border between Spain and Portugal the Knights Templar leave their tombs at night and come back from the dead as revenants
The reanimated corpses are blind because their eyes were pecked out by birds while their hanged bodies rotted on the gallows
While on vacation nearby with her friend Roger Virginia reconnects with her dear college friend Bet who relocated in the area and now runs a mannequin factory
Roger immediately takes a liking to Bet and invites her along for a train journey provoking Virginia s jealousy
Angry at both Virginia jumps off the train and spends the night among the ruins of Berzano
The knights rise from their tombs and attack her ultimately biting and ripping her flesh
The next morning Bet and Roger retrace Virginia s steps trying to find out what happened to her
They hear about the legend from some locals and meet two police investigators who inform them about Virginia s horrible fate
Later at the morgue next to Bet s laboratory Virginia s corpse comes back to life and kills a custodian then flees to Bet s lab and is only stopped by Bet s assistant who manages to set Virginia on fire
In the meanwhile Bet and Roger are investigating the legend with the help of Professor Candal who indirectly send them to find his son Pedro who lives near Berzano as a small time smuggler and is suspected by the police to be the one who killed Virginia as a way to instill fear in the locals
Once they ve located Pedro and convinced him to help them prove the knights are real Bet and Roger return with Pedro and his lover to Berzano to confront the knights once and for all

The story opens in the autumn of 1764
John Butler approximately fifteen years of age has lived with the Lenni Lenape in Ohio since being taken captive eleven years earlier
His adoptive Lenape father Cuyloga renamed him True Son
He is assimilated and accepted as a full blooded Lenape by that community
Along with other Native groups the Lenape enter into a peace treaty with the British forces
The treaty required that the Indians had to return any white captives
True Son did not want to leave as he was fully assimilated and considered himself Lenape he disdained white society
He tries to commit suicide in order to be free of the whites but is unsuccessful
Accompanied by a young soldier Del Hardy True Son is taken to Fort Pitt where he is met by Harry Butler his blood father
Hardy accompanies the Butlers to their home in Paxton Township near present day Harrisburg
After returning to his father s home True Son refuses to recognize his blood father continues to wear his Indian clothes and pretends that he no longer understands English
His younger brother Gordie is intrigued by his Indian ways and True Son becomes fond of him
Later True Son gets into a heated argument with his Uncle Wilse
Wilse accuses the Indians of scalping children which True Son denies
Wilse is so angered by what he perceives as the young man s lack of respect that he slaps True Son
That spring True Son develops an unidentified illness
His physical sickness is compounded by disappointment that none of his Lenape family has tried to contact him since he was forced to go to the Butlers
He is enheartened by learning that two Indians were asking about him at Wilse s shop
That evening he slips out of the Butlers house and discovers his Lenape cousin Half Arrow nearby
Their reunion is tempered by learning that men from Wilse s shop shot and scalped their friend Little Crane
The boys confront Wilse knocking him to the ground and scalping him
They escape the town into the forest and head west to return to the Lenape
Their people are angry over the murder of Little Crane and eventually the tribe declares war on the whites
They attack some small villages and scalp the settlers
True Son sees some children s scalps among the rest and is disturbed to learn that the Indians killed children as well as adults
True Son is used as bait to lure a band of settlers into an ambush but he gives away the plan when he sees a child among them who reminds him of Gordie
The Lenape are enraged and plan to burn True Son at the stake in ritual torture
His adoptive father Cuyloga convinces the other band members to banish his son
Cuyloga tells True Son that he is no longer Indian that he would be considered as a white enemy if ever seen again in Indian territory and that he is no longer True Son s father
Cuyloga accompanies True Son to a white road where they part

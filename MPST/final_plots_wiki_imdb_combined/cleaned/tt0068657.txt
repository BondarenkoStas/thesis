Philip Wermeer has escaped from prison where he serves a sentence for the murder of Ebenezer Saxon the patriarch of Saxon city who in his turn is believed to be behind the murder of Wermeer s father
Wermeer is holed up in Gila Bend by a swarm of bounty killers who want his 3 000 reward posted by Saxon s three sons David Eli and Adam
A sheriff named Clayton arrives on a stagecoach and bosses his way through the cordon set up by the local lawmen
While walking to the saloon he performs actions that tip off Wermeer as to where some of the besiegers are hidden
Wermeer makes it to the saloon where Clayton who has counted Wermeer s shots and knows that he is out of bullets arrests him
Hole a spokesman for the bounty killers calls on Wermeer to surrender
A shot rings out and Clayton emerges dragging the dead convict
They argue that Clayton who if he is a sheriff cannot collect bounty should give up the body
The disagreement develops into a gunfight
Wermeer jumps up on a horse and escapes pursued by the pack
Wermeer makes the bounty hunters follow his horse then hitches a ride with the stagecoach where he finds Clayton among the passengers
When they stay the night at Silver Bells Wermeer goes for a shotgun hanging on the wall but Clayton stops him
A drunken stationmaster assures the gun is empty but Clayton retorts Never consider a gun empty Then he and Wermeer play cards Wermeer betting his 3 000 bounty
Wermeer wins and Clayton promises to take him to Saxon city as he wants
Wermeer steals a revolver from Clayton s bag but is told that it is empty
Wermeer repeats Clayton s earlier saying and pulls the trigger but Clayton shows him the bullet taking it out of his mouth
Wermeer tries to leave but Clayton shoots the door this time with bullets
Bounty Hunters led by Hole surround the house
They give Wermeer thirty seconds
He and Clayton are inside with Elisabeth a female passenger who has earlier shown interest in Wermeer
Clayton tells her that Wermeer is innocent and that he saw who did it but if Wermeer walks out the door he will never know
Wermeer gives himself up
Hole and two of the bounty hunters now kill the others in their pack then ride off with Wermeer
Clayton finds them beating and questioning Wermeer in a waterfall asking where the silver of his father is and offering to let him go if he tells
Clayton shoots off the rope and liberates him
Wermeer asks if he is still a prisoner
When Clayton says no he holds a gun against Clayton and rides off to Saxon city on the latter s horse
Wermeer confronts the Saxon sons Adam and Eli
He accuses Eli and asks who killed his father
We also learn that Hole was sent by Eli to find out who really killed the old man Saxon
Clayton arrives and demands that the Saxons reopen Wermeer s case
Wermeer sends word to his own friends to gather at the silver mine A duel between Hole and Wermeer is supervised by Clayton after he reveals that it was Hole who killed Wermeer s father
An ambusher is there helping Hole but Wermeer shoots him without Clayton interfering
Adam Saxon massacres Wermeer s followers with hidden explosives and a machine gun
He also kills his own men not to leave any witnesses
David Saxon the oldest of the brothers meets with Clayton who says that they both know who killed the old man Saxon
David offers 25 000 if he and Wermeer leave town
Clayton relays the offer that the charge will be dropped
Wermeer replies that the Saxons made the offer because dead people don t need a leader Adam shoots him from a window though Elisabeth who arrived in town to marry Adam cries out a warning
Clayton escapes during the gunfight
In the morning Wermeer is to be hanged
Clayton says he knows who is the real killer
David wants the hanging to continue but Eli says that he must know
Clayton confesses that he himself did it saying that the judge was bought by Saxon so justice could only be done this way
The Saxons agree to meet him at the cattle pens
At the confrontation when Clayton approaches David says that the three must draw first to overcome Clayton s expert gunplay
Wermeer from a distance shoots off Clayton s hat so that he draws first and kills the three men
Wermeer picks up his hat and gun and says that Clayton now can go back to being a sheriff
Wermeer leaves for Mexico with Elisabeth not caring about the silver
The old man from the stagecoach drives them

Jerry Bolanti a Mafia connected hoodlum is released from jail and is looking for a job
During this very uncertain and stressful transitional period he plays the field to help stay relaxed
He discovers almost by accident that he has a talent for debt collecting and intimidation
He then decides to pay a visit to a mid level wiseguy acquaintance and offer up his services
His first task is to collect from a certain Bernie Feldshuh
Before he can deliver the swag to his capo he is intercepted by Bernie s henchmen who take back the money and leave him for dead
Jerry returns to Bernie s home while still healing from his gunshot wounds and extracts a moderate amount of retribution
Bernie s response is to hire a top notch assassin named Marley to take down Jerry as well as the lawyer named Herb Greene who commissioned him to collect on the debt in the first place
An unfortunate secretary becomes collateral damage
Jerry s boss Anthony learns of the deed and sends a man of his own to even the score
An unfortunate bodyguard becomes collateral damage and Jerry never does recover the 28 000
His next assignment is to team up with enforcers Joe and Serge to conduct a raid on a shop manager for 40 000 that he may or may not have owed to somebody
But Bernie s newly hired hitman Marley is watching and waiting for an opportunity to take Jerry down
This proves disastrous for the entire operation
After the heist the trio of gangsters heads over to a hotel room to count out the profits and celebrate a little
While Jerry is downstairs in the hotel restaurant their secret adversary Marley assassinates both Serge and Joe
He makes off with the money as well
At this point Jerry s handler Tony begins accusing him of keeping the loot for himself
He refuses to believe that Jerry could make off with so much money only to immediately lose it all again
Nobody could possibly be that incompetent
Jerry manages to tease out the contractor s identity from a restaurateur named Spinoza
He hunts Marley down and terminates his career in a field of tall grass
Later he receives a call from Gus at the local junk yard
A camper comes in to tell that Jerry might be able to salvage for himself and his live in girlfriend Paula
Just as things begin looking rosy for Jerry and Paula he is bushwhacked right in front of the battered red camper by three gun toting villains
He dies as a result
The movie ends exactly the same way it began by showing the same two hoodlums in the same automobile dumping yet another body into the same ravine
Only this time instead of an anonymous corpse it s young Jerry Bolanti
The mastermind behind this particular hit is then shown to be none other than his former boss Tony

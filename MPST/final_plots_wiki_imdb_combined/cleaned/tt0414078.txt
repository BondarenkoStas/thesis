Two years after the previous movie 17 year old Marnie Piper prepares to begin a new school year
She asks the Halloweentown Council to work toward openness between Halloweentown and the mortal world
She proposes bringing a group of Halloweentown students to her own high school in the mortal world
The Council is initially apprehensive mostly due to the legend of the Knights of the Iron Dagger a fanatical knighthood who wanted to destroy all things magical
The Halloweentown Witches Council however agrees to accept the plan after Marnie mistakenly bets all the Cromwell magic that her plan will work
If she does not prove she is right by midnight on Halloween then her entire family will lose their magical abilities
Marnie regretting what she said to the Council wants to cancel the program she has made but her grandmother Aggie opposes saying that they have nothing to fear
The Halloweentown students arrive and are magically given human appearances to disguise their true non human natures
School begins with Marnie acting as a tour guide for the exchange group claiming they are from Canada
Aggie substitute teaches so she can be available in case of need
Cody a new student shows a romantic interest in Marnie
While Aggie proves unable to teach any subject effectively the Halloweentown students keep to themselves hiding in the refuge that Aggie magically creates for them in a remote student locker
Marnie gradually encourages the students to join sports teams school activities and to make new friends
Marnie s progress is interrupted by a warning that appears to be from the Knights of the Iron Dagger then by a magical incident at the mall that results in the Halloweentown students assuming their natural appearances in public
This is followed by a break in at the secret magical locker and the disappearance of one of the students
Meanwhile Marnie s developing relationship with Cody parallels an unexpected romance beginning between Aggie and the school s principal Phil Flannigan
Aggie suspects Cody of being the cause of the trouble and tries to convince Marnie to halt their relationship but Marnie in turn suspects Flannigan
They eventually discover that Flannigan is the Knight in question he was told prior to the students arrival that he was the last of the Order
Edgar Dalloway head of the Witches Council and father of one of the students is the real root of their problems
He wants to keep Halloweentown isolated from the mortal world and used Flannigan to ensure the failure of Marnie s project
This he hoped would cause a negative reaction in Halloweentown and keep the portal between Halloweentown and the mortal world closed
The Halloweentown students use the school s Halloween carnival to improve mortal attitudes toward magical folk
Their haunted house depicts the ordinary lives of creatures that have typically been seen as monsters in the mortal world including displays like the Monster Tea Party and ogres picnicking in their natural setting which winds up boring the carnival goers
Meanwhile Marnie s mother Gwen uses a Witch s Glass to hunt down the missing student imprisoned by Dalloway
At the school carnival Dalloway launches magical attacks against the mortal students by bringing the inanimate monsters in the haunted house to life
The ensuing panic spirals beyond Marnie s and Aggie s ability to contain the monsters
Flannigan incites a mob to corner the Halloweentown students
Cody shames the crowd the students reveal themselves and the crowd accepts them for who they are
Flannigan also renounces being a knight and accepts Aggie
Dalloway claims the Cromwell magic and explains that his son Ethan helped with most of the things that happened but Gwen has shown the evening s events to the Witches Council
They return the Cromwell magic Gwen returns with the imprisoned student and the Council imprisons Dalloway in another Witch s Glass
The portal between Halloweentown and the mortal world opens inside the haunted house and crowds of children from Halloweentown cross over to enjoy the carnival together with children of the mortal world
Marnie flies off for a romantic broom ride with Cody
While flying over the carnival they kiss

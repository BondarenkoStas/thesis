Every one of our lives is stuffed with secrets of lies of hidden desires and fears we can reveal to no one
Believing in lies or hearsay deferring to other peoples reality these are things that come surprisingly easily to most of us
But what happens if you start believing in your own lies A barber working in Istanbul longs to be both here and far far away
And one day without warning he takes himself off and disappears abruptly into the great far away
But is it really possible to begin a completely new life far far away as a nobody There is a village there far away
But where exactly is a mystery
And when which year which age that too is a mystery
It is as if time has stood still locked in eternal spring There is a village there far away All well and good but whose village is it The village is in the hands of the mukhtar the elected local chief
The barber from Istanbul settles in this far flung village and as chance would have it the one time local barber Jingle Nuri vanished from the place years ago
So the new barber rents his shop and opens the doors for business The village is not however the innocent village of your imagination
The mukhtar the leader of the village its everything finds himself dealing with one mysterious disappearance after the other
Güvercin the prettiest girl in the village is now missing without trace
The mukhtar and his only armed man the village guard set about questioning everyone in the village
The mukhtar suspects Cennets son more than anyone else
And he beats the gentle dreamer with the soul of a poet to a pulp as he cross examines him which causes the boy to lose his mind
The mukhtar and the guard spread terror through the village but still they fail to find Güvercin
And Cennets son starts drifting through the streets of the village asking Why does snow fall snow
even though not a flake of snow has even been known to fall In despair the mukhtar seeks the advice of the village sage Musa Dede but only to be reminded that the history of the village is full of such secrets misdemeanours and disappearances Even more peculiar things start happening
Jingle Nuri suddenly turns up out of the blue for instance
He arrives but now its the turn of his wife who has been waiting patiently for him all these years to disappear
Then a bogus love spell is cast in order to convince Güvercins stubborn and sceptical father of the power of incantations this is after all their last resort to finding the girl
The trouble is the spell backfires and an innocent lad is killed in the process The mukhtar the guard and the villagers are appalled by the succession of disappearances and deaths they seem to encounter every step of the way
The complexities of life and their bewildering destiny as a village are simply dizzying In the end the mukhtar decides to turn to the state to resolve his unspeakable troubles
So he sets off for the district town never to return again Güvercin is eventually found but this solves none of the villages problems
On the contrary it leads to her being swallowed up by a gigantic lie fabricated by the villagers themselves The barber seems content to watch this all from the distance like a dispassionate spectator
And one day when the poplar pollen is wafting through the air like the snowflakes that never fall he just walks away looking down on the village for the very last time from a nearby hill But what the barber doesnt know is that he too is being watched by someone far far away written by Ümit Ünal

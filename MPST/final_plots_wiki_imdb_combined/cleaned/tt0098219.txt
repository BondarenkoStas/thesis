During the 1977 El Salvadoran presidential election public unrest is at an all time high over fears of election fraud
In the midst of a guerrilla uprising the military regime sends death squads to detain torture and kill anyone who speaks out against its terrible human rights record
The military also prevents average citizens from getting to the polls soldiers are shown blocking a bus bringing people to town on election day
When the people decide to walk the military shoots up their vans so that they have no transportation for the return journey
The Vatican elevates conservative yet reserved Oscar Arnulfo Romero to the position of Archbishop of San Salvador hoping that with he will not get involved in the military dispute
Although apolitical Romero is afraid of the government s increasing hostility
He initially refrains from stirring anti government sentiments but progressively as he spends more time in his post he sees evidence of deception oppression and systemic murder after which he cannot support the government in good conscience and speaks out
After the assassination of Father Rutilio Grande an outspoken Jesuit advocate for the poor and close friend of Father Romero s Romero begins to take a stand against the government s policies prompting the death squads to begin targeting priests
After failing to rescue a pro government hostage of the guerrillas in a botched ransom Romero discovers that his friend Father Osuna a militant critic of the ruling regime has been captured and tortured
After securing his release Romero instigates a boycott of the president elect s inauguration defying him by taking Mass in a church the military has taken over as a barracks
He later attempts to secure the release of a soldier taken hostage by Osuna and the guerrillas but is arrested in the process
Osuna is subsequently tortured to death
Undeterred Romero rejects the violent methods of the guerrillas but is nonetheless assassinated while saying Mass specifically while consecrating the Eucharist
In the last scene it freezes to take a moment to state Archbishop Romero was murdered on March 24 1980
He had spoken the disturbing truth
Many chose not to listen
As a result between 1980 and 1989 more than 60 000 Salvadorians were killed
But the struggle for peace and freedom justice and dignity goes on

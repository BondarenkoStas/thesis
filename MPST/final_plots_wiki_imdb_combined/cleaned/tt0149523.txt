Shindig
was conceived as a short notice replacement for Hootenanny a series that had specialized in folk revival music
The folk revival had fizzled in 1964 as the result of the British Invasion which damaged the ratings for Hootenanny and prompted that show s cancellation
Shindig
focused on a broader variety of popular music than its predecessor and first aired for a half hour every Wednesday evening but was expanded to an hour in January 1965
In the fall of 1965 the show split into two half hour telecasts on Thursday and Saturday nights
Shindig
s premiere episode was actually the second pilot and featured Sam Cooke The Everly Brothers and The Righteous Brothers
Later shows were taped in Britain with The Beatles as the guests
The series featured other British invasion bands and performers including The Who The Rolling Stones and Cilla Black
Shindig continued to broadcast episodes from London throughout its run
Many popular performers of the day played on Shindig
including Tina Turner Lesley Gore Bo Diddley and Sonny and Cher The Beach Boys James Brown Jackie Wilson The Supremes and The Ronettes
Shindig
s success prompted NBC to air the similar series Hullabaloo starting in January 1965 and other producers to launch syndicated rock music shows like Shivaree and Hollywood A Go Go
In March 1965 Little Eva performed her hit song The Loco Motion in a live but short version of the song
This is the only known video clip of her singing the song
Towards the end of the program s run The Mamas and the Papas appeared in an episode featuring Barry McGuire
Although serving as his backup singers the group introduced California Dreamin on the program which launched the group s career
Shindig
is one of the few rock music shows of the era to still have all of the episodes available to watch

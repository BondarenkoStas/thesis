The plot is a parody of the Three Little Pigs told from a Second World War anti German propaganda perspective
In this cartoon the pigs go to war against Adolf Wolf who is set on invading their country Pigmania
The two pigs who built their houses of straw and sticks claim they don t have to take precautions against the wolf because they signed non aggression pacts with him
The pig who built his house of stone Sergeant Pork does take his precautions and outfits his house with defense machinery
Adolf Wolf invades Pigmania despite the two pigs protesting that he signed a treaty with them
He destroys their houses whereupon the pigs flee to the third pig s house
Then the Wolf and pigs start fighting
Towards the end of the cartoon Adolf Wolf is blown out of his bomber plane by the pigs artillery shells filled with Defense bonds and falls down to Earth together with a bomb which blows him to Hell
There he realizes he is dead and says Where am I
Have I been blown to

whereupon a group of devils adds Ehhhh it s a possibility
in reference to a then well known catchphrase by Jerry Colonna

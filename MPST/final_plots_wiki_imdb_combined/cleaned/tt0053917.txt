Captain Wade Hunnicutt is a wealthy and powerful man
His wife Hannah a gentle and cultured woman has ceased to love him because of his womanizing
Their son Theron is like his mother and Wade wants to toughen him up
Theron is in love with Libby Halstead but is too shy to ask her out
Rafe Copley the Hunnicutts hired hand speaks to Libby on Theron s behalf
She agrees to accompany him to a barbecue at his parents home
But when he goes to pick her up Mr Halstead orders him away because he is the Captain s son
Theron goes home very upset but his father is angry at him for not standing up to Mr Halstead Since Libby cannot see Theron openly they begin meeting at a secluded spot
Soon their relationship becomes intimate
Then Theron learns that Rafe is actually his half brother
Enraged and disgusted because Wade has relegated Rafe to the status of a hired hand Theron announces that he is no longer his father s son
He gathers all the money he has and presents it to Rafe along with the keys to his car
But Rafe returns everything
Theron then leaves home and gets a menial job in town
Feeling that he is tainted by his father s actions he tells Libby that he can t see her anymore Some time later Mr Halstead pays a visit to the Hunnicutt home and tells the Captain that Theron is more than welcome to call on Libby
Wade reminds him that the last time Theron called at their home he was ordered away
Mr Halstead insists it was a mistake
Wade then taunts Mr Halstead by suggesting that his daughter is in trouble and wanting to pin the blame on Theron
Mr Halstead knows he is beaten and leaves Rafe encounters Libby in the grocery store
His shopping cart is filled with frozen TV dinners which Libby reminds him are not healthy
Somewhat coyly she suggests that he needs a good woman to look after him
When he asks if she knows such a woman she bursts into tears
Over coffee she confides that she needs to get married right away
Rafe offers to talk to Theron and make sure he does the right thing
Libby says Theron wants nothing to do with her now
Rafe offers himself as a substitute and Libby accepts He and Libby marry at the justice of the peace s office and take up residence at the Halstead home
Mr and Mrs Halstead are very grateful to Rafe for saving their daughter from disgrace
He and Libby soon fall in love for real and several months later become the parents of a son At the baby s christening Mr Halstead overhears some lewd remarks suggesting that the baby sure looks like Captain Hunnicutt
He concludes mistakenly that Wade is the father and not Theron
Later that day he goes to the Hunnicutt home with a shotgun
Theron is there visiting his mother
He runs to get Rafe but they are too late
Mr Halstead has shot Wade and fled in his pickup truck
Grabbing a gun Theron goes after him
Rafe follows and eventually catches up
Mr Halstead is dead shot by Theron
Rafe says they have to go to the police and promises he will be with Theron every step of the way
But Theron says he could never face Libby after this and he is leaving
Rafe asks how he will survive but Theron just shrugs
Then he walks away into the woods Several months later Rafe stops by the cemetery and encounters Hannah visiting her husband s grave
On it is an inscription that Wade was the father of two fine sons Raphael and Theron
Rafe is shocked and asks Hannah if she is sure she wants it right out in the open
She says it is time the truth was known
Rafe then asks her if she would like to visit his son once in a while
He does not say the boy is Theron s son but Hannah seems to know
She agrees and they walk away together

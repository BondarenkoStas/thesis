Kain relies on Raziel s free will in a bid to outsmart Moebius and resolve the dilemma he faced in Blood Omen ultimately hoping to enable both the restored Pillars and the vampire race to co exist in the future
Soul Reaver 2 opens as Raziel emerges from the time slip and is greeted by Moebius having arrived in an era 30 years prior to the events of Blood Omen
Two further time periods 100 years after and 500 years before Blood Omen respectively are also explored as the story progresses
Characters Raziel returns as the protagonist of Soul Reaver 2
In Soul Reaver Raziel discovered that he was once a human and a leading member of the vampire hunting Sarafan brotherhood and his epiphanies drive the conflict in the story
Kain the antagonist of Soul Reaver appears as a non player character in cutscenes urging Raziel to unearth his destiny
Moebius the Time Streamer a sorcerer who was a villain in Blood Omen attempts to manipulate Raziel into destroying Kain it is revealed that he is an agent of The Elder God Raziel s ally and guide in Soul Reaver who is slowly established as a more sinister entity
Ariel a specter bound to the Pillars who featured in Blood Omen and Soul Reaver returns and the vampire Vorador also from Blood Omen assists Raziel early in the game
The ancient vampire Janos Audron a new character who was previously only mentioned in Blood Omen acts as Raziel s mentor towards the end of the story
Story The game begins by summarizing Soul Reaver s ending Raziel confronts Kain in Nosgoth s wasteland and pursues him through a portal leading to the past
Moebius the leader of a vampire hunting crusade in this age coerces Raziel to re embrace his former heritage as a Sarafan vampire hunter by killing Kain
Though Raziel is initially eager to do so his enthusiasm wanes over time as he witnesses the ruthlessness of Moebius s soldiers
Kain who is destined to die at Raziel s hands in this era implores Raziel to thwart fate and instead facilitate his quest to restore the Pillars
After he learns that Moebius serves The Elder God and that he has thus been duped Raziel faces a decision indulge his lust for vengeance but submit to fate by killing Kain or defy his cohorts and exercise his free will by exerting mercy
While exploring this period Raziel discovers evidence that two ancient races waged war in Nosgoth s distant past
One race created the Pillars to banish their adversaries but the enemy race the Hylden retaliated with a curse which transformed the Pillars architects into the first vampires
Kain explains that had he sacrificed himself the vampire race the rightful inheritors of the Pillars would have become extinct
Raziel chooses to spare Kain causing a paradox history reshuffles itself to accommodate the extension of Kain s life
He however refuses to indulge Kain s plans any further instead opting to explore his own past
Vorador tells Raziel that the last of the ancient vampires Janos Audron held the key to Raziel s destiny but Janos was murdered by the Sarafan five centuries ago
Deciding to speak with Janos Raziel orders Moebius to send him further back in time
Moebius deceives Raziel instead conveying him over a century into the future where he and The Elder God highlight the consequences of the Pillars destruction to turn Raziel against Kain
Raziel navigates the future era and finds his own way back to the age of the Sarafan and Janos Audron
There Janos presents Raziel with the Reaver a younger version of the physical Soul Reaver blade which will later house a soul devouring spirit
Suddenly a group of Sarafan led by Raziel s former human self launch an ambush and Janos sacrifices himself
Raziel swears vengeance as Janos dies and pursues the attackers
He uses the Reaver to kill them and his younger self renouncing his Sarafan past
The wraith blade attached to Raziel s arm over aroused after the deaths of the Sarafan suddenly seizes control of the physical Reaver and impales Raziel Raziel horrified then realizes his destiny
He himself has always been the ravenous spirit inside the Reaver and therefore is fated to be stuck in a time loop the sword shattered against him in Soul Reaver because it was unable to consume itself
While his soul is being drawn into the sword Kain emerges and tears the Reaver from Raziel s body saving him in reciprocation and forcing history to reshuffle again
However this paradox strains Nosgoth s history too far enabling the Hylden to return and jeopardize his ambition to restore the Pillars
Amidst Kain s dismay Raziel realizes that the wraith blade is still bound to him and laments that his destiny has not been changed but merely postponed

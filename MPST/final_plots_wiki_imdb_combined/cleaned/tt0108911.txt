An extraterrestrial entity named Princess Snow Kaguya arrives on Earth in an attempt to freeze it but a fragment of her comet has been lost and she is unable to proceed without it
She has her henchwomen the Snow Dancers search for the missing fragment
In Tokyo a young astronomer named Kakeru ÅŒzora finds the fragment and keeps it in his observatory to study it further
Meanwhile the Sailor Guardians are enjoying a day in the Juban Shopping District
Luna falls ill and decides to go back to Usagi s house
Along the way she collapses while crossing the road and is almost hit by a car but is rescued and nursed to health by Kakeru
Luna then develops strong romantic feelings for him even kissing him on the cheek in his sleep leaving Artemis devastated
Luna herself ends up with unrequited love because it is revealed that Kakeru himself has a girlfriend an astronaut named Himeko Nayotake and more importantly because Luna is a cat
The two are devastated because Himeko is oblivious to Kakeru s belief of Princess Kaguya s existence
Later after finding herself unable to reconcile her differences with Kakeru Himeko leaves on a space mission
The fragment of the comet attaches itself to his life force and begins slowly stealing his life force energy causing him to become very ill Kaguya later steals the shard but because it is linked to his life force he is brought even closer to death when Kaguya throws the shard into the ocean and creates an enormous ice crystal that will continue to draw away Kakeru s life force energy completely
She and her Snow Dancers then begin freezing the entire Earth
The Sailor Guardians attempt to stop her but every time they kill the Snow Dancers Kaguya keeps reviving them using the crystal
Just before Kaguya could kill the soldiers Usagi tries to stop her and uses the Holy Grail to transform into Super Sailor Moon
She uses her Rainbow Moon Heartache attack but is easily overpowered by Kaguya s strength and power
Determined to protect the Earth Usagi prepares to activate the Legendary Silver Crystal s immense energy and power
The eight Sailor Guardians along with Chibiusa combine their powers and abilities all at once to activate the Legendary Silver Crystal and it hits Kaguya head on
The Silver Crystal s power also destroys Kaguya s Snow Dancers the ice crystal in the ocean as well as her comet
With peace once again returned to the Earth Usagi wishes for Luna to become Princess Kaguya
Concerned about Himeko s safety Kakeru wanders in the snowstorm and is saved by Luna at the exact point Kakeru saved her transformed into a beautiful human woman
She takes him near the moon where Himeko on her space mission witnesses the phenomenon and realizes that Princess Kaguya is real
Luna tells him that he needs to start focusing on his relationship with Himeko and the two kiss
After returning to the Earth Kakeru takes up Luna s advice and meets Himeko at the airport where the two reconcile

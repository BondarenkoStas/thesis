The film starts in the middle of an unspecified mission which sees Hellboy Liz Sherman and Abe Sapien battling bat worshipping Mayan zombies who are led by a gigantic zombie bat
The group are eventually able to defeat their opponents when Liz unleashes her pyrokinetic powers although she is still unsure of her ability to control her powers
Meanwhile Japanese folklore expert Professor Sakai obtains an ancient scroll containing the myth of two demonic brothers Thunder and Lightning
Hundreds of years ago the brothers roamed the earth unleashing storms on the lands of a Japanese Lord
In exchange for mercy the Lord promised to give them his beautiful daughter
One of the Lord s samurai warriors was in love with the daughter and hid her in a shrine to protect her
Armed with the Sword of Storms a mystical sword imbued with an ancient spell to defeat Thunder and Lightning the warrior fought the brothers and trapped both demons spirits in the sword
Although his lands and daughter had been saved the Lord was not pleased since the warrior s actions meant the Lord had broken a promise
In an act of vengeance the Lord summoned the gods to turn the warrior to stone and then killed his daughter in the shrine
In current day Japan Professor Sakai is possessed by the spirits of Thunder and Lightning while reading the scroll
The demonic brothers send the professor in search of the mystical sword
After he attacks the sword collector who currently owns the sword the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense is alerted and Hellboy Kate Corrigan and a psychic named Russell Thorne are called in with a team to investigate
During the investigation Hellboy picks up a discarded katana and vanishes to another dimension that is reminiscent of ancient Japan
Hellboy meets a wise kitsune who tells him that the sword he holds is the Sword of Storms and that the goal of his journey lies to the west
Hellboy travels through the alternate universe and learns that he can only return to his own world by breaking the sword although that will also free the demonic brothers
Along the way Hellboy encounters several mythical Yōkai sent by the still possessed Professor Sakai who try to steal the sword from him including the kappa a trio of rokurokubi a group of nukekubi a Jorōgumo Gashadokuro tengu Yomotsu shikome and the restless ghost of the Lord s daughter
Hellboy is able to outsmart or defeat all of them
Meanwhile Abe Sapien and Liz Sherman are called to the sites of disturbing earthquakes and discover that Thunder and Lightning are summoning their brothers the dragons
They meet the same kitsune who guided Hellboy and are instructed to stop the dragons
One of the dragons attacks them but Liz manages to hold it back using her pyrokinetic abilities
Professor Sakai in the meantime has gone to the shrine where the Lord killed his daughter followed by Kate and Russell who have just survived an attack by several objects from Japanese folklore
At the same time Hellboy is tricked into destroying the sword by the giant Oni which releases Thunder and Lightning frees Professor Sakai and sends Hellboy to the shrine as well
Hellboy eventually manages to trap both spirits in the sword again
As a result the dragons are sealed back into the underworld
The ghosts of the daughter and the Lord possess Kate and Russell in order to replay the daughter s execution
Hellboy accidentally frees the ghost of the samurai warrior from its stone form and then convinces the Lord to forgive his daughter and the warrior thereby breaking the cycle of their unending deaths
The spirits depart thankful to Hellboy and the others for helping them

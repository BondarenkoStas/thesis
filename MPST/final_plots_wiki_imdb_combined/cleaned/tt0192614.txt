Luke becomes disgusted with the order and refuses to participate further despite threats from Levritt that he will be tracked down someday and despite or even because of Levritt s offer that the Skulls will accept him because he has proven himself in war
As Luke walks away Levritt says to himself Well done son well done
It has been speculated because of this along with other incidents in the film that Levritt may be Luke s father

In a house at Cherry Tree Lane distant couple Christine and Mike are eating dinner while their son Sebastian is out at football practice
When the doorbell rings and Christine goes to answer it the couple is attacked by Rian Asad and Teddy who hold them both hostage and tie them up in their front room
Knowing Sebastian will be returning at 9 00PM the group waits for his return so that they can get revenge on him for grassing on Rian s cousin and getting him sent to prison Teddy leaves with Mike s credit cards to find a cash machine
Rian suddenly drags Christine into another room to presumably rape her leaving Asad to guard a frustrated Mike
Asad allows Mike to have a drink and explains that he is not as violent as Rian and tells Mike details about his life
Rian s school friends Beth and Charman and Beth s younger brother Oscar then arrive with an axe for Rian to use on Sebastian
Oscar gets sent into the kitchen while Teddy returns with Mike s money for Rian to send to his cousin
Sebastian returns home and is dragged upstairs to his room by the teenagers who begin to torture and beat him
Hearing his son s screams Mike desperately struggles to free himself and is able to knock a knife off the dinner table so that he can cut his wrists free
He goes into the next room to find a traumatised Christine tied up and naked underneath a blanket
Arming himself with a candlestick he attempts to sneak upstairs but his presence is alerted by Charman who was exiting the bathroom
Asad Teddy Charman and Beth flee from the house while Mike grapples with Rian before finally beating him down with the candlestick and then his fists
Christine comes upstairs to comfort a bloodied Sebastian who slowly loses consciousness in her arms while she hysterically screams for Mike to do something
Mike goes downstairs to call 999 then goes into the kitchen to drink from the tap when he senses someone behind him and turns around to see Oscar standing there
The film ends with Mike knife in hand and Oscar both staring at each other unsure of what to do next

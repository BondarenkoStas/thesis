The story is based on two distinct early 19th century themes the suppression of the Atlantic slave trade and the often tragic fate of people on ships lost at sea
The first theme is examined through the efforts of abolitionists Michael Nuggin Taylor and Powdah to end the slave trade
Although the United States prohibited the importation of slaves in 1808 slaves were still brought into the country illegally
Great Britain also prohibited the slave trade putting the Royal Navy into action against slave traders but even Britain had its supporters of the trade as a British naval officer acting for the slave interests
The conflict between Taylor and Wilcoxon is complicated by Tarryton s sister Margaret falling in love with Taylor
The second theme appears when the Taylor Wilcoxon conflict becomes entangled with the loss of the ship William Brown
The William Brown is accidentally set on fire by a little girl and must be abandoned
The captain is in injured and although a passanger Taylor takes over
Only one lifeboat is launched which cannot carry all the survivors many of whom are swimming in the ocean nearby
Taylor stops these desperate people from climbing into the lifeboat and swamping it shooting some with a pistol
As as result he is subsequently tried and convicted for murder Barton Woodley explains his actions thus resulting a new trial for Taylor
Margaret seeing Taylor in this new light lets Michael know she still loves him
The 1957 film Seven Waves Away also dealt with the issue of the limits of lifeboat space and decisions of the first mate
The real William Brown case The William Brown hit an iceberg and sank on 19 April 1841 with loss of life
A seaman one Alexander Holmes acted similarly to Taylor in the movie
He was convicted of manslaughter but sentenced only to a 20 fine and six months imprisonment

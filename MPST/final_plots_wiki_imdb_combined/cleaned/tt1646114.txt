It is summer and young driver Georgy takes his light truck on a trip to another town with a cargo of flour
He is stopped at a road police post by a pair of rude and corrupt policemen
While they are flirting with the woman they stopped earlier Georgy manages to grab his papers and leave unnoticed
There he picks up a hitchhiker an old man who recounts him a disturbing story soon after World War II while returning home from the front a corrupt military officer brazenly robbed him by threatening him with arrest if he did not comply
He later shot the officer in retaliation
Later when Georgy parks his truck and steps out and shortly returns the old man has disappeared
Later Georgy meets an underage prostitute
He takes pity on the girl and gives her some money and food but she is offended by his charity insults him and leaves
Later yet Georgy is lost in the night and decides to camp in the field until dawn
Three locals approach and try to steal from the truck only to be stopped by Georgy
They distract his attention with some neutral conversation telling him how one of their friends is a mute because someone killed his father in front of him when he was a child
Suddenly one hits Georgy on the head with a log and he loses consciousness
The scene shifts to the times of World War II
Early in the war two Soviet soldiers from a defeated unit cautiously feel their way through the occupied land in the deep German rear
They enter a lone house where lives a widowed teacher with his infant son
The teacher is kind to the soldiers and provides them with much needed food and shelter
However the soldiers regard his pacifism and indifference towards the German invaders as treasonous so they kill him rob the house and continue on their way leaving the child to his own devices
The scene shifts back to the present
Some time has passed
It is winter and Georgy lives in the same house that once was the teacher s
The blow has left him feeble minded and mute
He walks around bearded dilapidated with blank stare
The woman living in the house keeps him as a sex slave
Meanwhile she trades his flour on the local market
A policeman approaches and tells her that Georgy and his truck are searched for so she better get rid of both
Georgy is beaten by the locals and detained by the police only to be released the next night when another inmate challenges the lone guard to a fight beats him unconscious and unlocks the cells
The woman sells Georgy s truck and leaves the place abandoning man in the snowcapped village
Homeless he wanders the round about being driven off by the locals until he collapses from exhaustion
He is found and picked up by the old man whom he earlier gave a ride
A military van comes to the village carrying two servicemen tasked with delivering the body of a deceased soldier to his native place
Their daunting task is not made easier by the fact that one of them an officer suffers from delirium tremens
Unable to locate the relatives of the dead soldier they decide to bribe some random people into signing the papers and leave the body to them
They approach the old man who at first is suspicious but eventually agrees
However shortly afterwards Georgy walks out of the house to find the old man dead
It is hinted that he may have been axed by the officer who in his alcoholic delusion mistook him for someone else
Georgy numbly grabs the old man s pistol and walks out to the road where he is picked up by a very talkative truck driver who rambles about the importance of not meddling in other people s affairs
Meanwhile on the road the same two police officers from the beginning of the movie stop a police major and his wife
When they begin to write him up for a burnt out headlight the major attempts to bribe and intimidate them
When this fails and he turns to leave a fistfight ensues with the major handcuffed and brutally beaten
To produce two fake witnesses of his arrest they stop another car which is the truck with Georgy
They easily threaten the driver into signing the papers but when they turn to Georgy he stands silently
A fight breaks out and one of the policemen pulls out an assault rifle
Georgy instantly shoots him dead then everyone else
Still clutching the pistol he staggers out into the dark

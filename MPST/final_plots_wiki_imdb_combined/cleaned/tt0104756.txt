Lorenzo is a bright and vibrant young boy living in the Comoro Islands as his father Augusto works for the World Bank and is stationed there
However when his parents relocate to the United States he begins to show neurological problems
The boy is diagnosed as having adrenoleukodystrophy which is fatal within two years
Failing to find a doctor capable of treating their son s rare disease Augusto and his wife Michaela set out on a mission to find a treatment to save their child
In their quest the Odones clash with doctors scientists and support groups who are skeptical that anything could be done about ALD much less by laypeople
But they persist setting up camp in medical libraries reviewing animal experiments enlisting the aid of Professor Gus Nikolais badgering researchers questioning top doctors all over the world and even organizing an international symposium about the disease
Despite research dead ends the horror of watching their son s health decline and being surrounded by skeptics they persist until they finally hit upon a therapy involving adding a certain kind of oil to their son s diet
They contact over 100 firms around the world until they find an elderly British chemist working for Croda International who is willing to take on the challenge of distilling the proper formula
The oil erucic acid proves successful in normalizing the accumulation of the very long chain fatty acids in the brain that had been causing their son s steady decline thereby halting the progression of the disease
There is still a great deal of neurological damage remaining which could not be reversed unless new treatments could be found to regenerate the myelin sheath around the nerves
The father is seen taking on the new challenge of organizing biomedical efforts to heal myelin damage in patients
Finally Lorenzo at the age of 14 shows definite improvement but more medical research is still needed
Ultimately it is revealed that Lorenzo has also regained his sight and is learning to use a computer

Ricardo Guglielmini is the mayor of Colonia Vela a small country village in an undisclosed province of central Argentina
He plots with Héctor Suprino a local Peronist spin doctor and Reinaldo a union leader to get the town s deputy mayor Ignacio Fuentes kicked out of office due to his increasing popularity which threatens Guglilemini s decades long hold on the mayorship
Fuentes is told that he has to fire his assistant Mateo because of his Marxist sympathies
Fuentes despite disagreeing with Marxist ideals himself declines refusing to be politically strong armed
Taking advantage of this Guglilemini publicly accuses Fuentes of aiding communist guerillas as an excuse to fire him or get him to resign
When Fuentes refuses Gugliemini sends the police to arrest him but Fuentes rather than cave in to the pressure takes to arms and then barricades himself in the town hall along with his allies and friends Mateo Corporal García Juan Rodrigo Moyito and Crazy Ceres
Guglielmini orders the police to storm the building which leads to a massive stand off between the local police force and Fuentes men
The counter Fuentes operation led by Chief Llanos and Sub Chief Rossi initially only attempts to threaten Fuentes into surrendering but soon evolves into a real shootout when members of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance led by Rogelio Almeido show up and intervene
During the shootout with the AAA Moyito is killed and several police officers are wounded which leads to a temporary ceasefire and a deadlock
Juan sneaks out through the back to look for the local crop duster pilot Cerviño in order to convince him to help Fuentes by conducting an aerial attack as a distraction so he can sneak more ammo and explosives into the building
As night falls a group of delusional local leftist guerrilla youths led by Matilda Gómez gather in an abandoned warehouse and make a completely unrealistic and blatantly flawed plan to use the conflict as a means to start a civil war in Argentina take over the government and convert the country into a communist state
They start out by kidnapping Chief Llanos and holding him for a ransom of several tons of explosives and weaponry
Not wanting to give more resources to the communists Guglielmini abandons Llanos and declares Rossi the new police chief
Rossi leads a new attack on Fuentes this time using bulldozers as cover to advance on the town hall
Rodrigo and Crazy Ceres are killed during this attack and Fuentes García and Mateo are barely saved because Cerviño arrives in the nick of time and sprays pesticides all over the police with his plane causing them to temporarily disperse
The guerrillas attack the local union with a pipe bomb killing Reinaldo which prompts the AAA agents to abandon the fight against Fuentes and instead attempt to kill the guerrilla troopers
Famed local Radical former senator Prudencio Gúzman attempts to negotiate with the communists for Llanos release but the peace talks fall through and Llanos is ultimately executed
The police regroup and prepare for a third attack
In order to buy some time and distract Rossi Mateo turns himself in while Fuentes García and Juan prepare a bomb with the explosives the latter had previously brought in
Regardless of Mateo s surrender the raid proceeds and when the police storms the town hall the bomb goes off killing several police officers and giving Fuentes García and Juan enough time to escape through the back
In retaliation Almeido kills Mateo
Despite managing to escape the town hall the trio are soon found by the police and Fuentes and García are taken captive
Juan however manages to escape
Desperate he contacts the guerrillas who promise to help free Fuentes and García if Juan shows them where he keeps his explosives stash
Juan additionally convinces Cerviño to cause one more diversion with his plane
Juan and the guerrillas this time led by Matilda Gómez herself carry out an attack on the school
First Cerviño uses his plane to drop manure on the police distracting them long enough to allow Juan and Matilda to sneak into the building
Once inside they bust García free but due to AAA reinforcements they re forced to leave Fuentes behind
The AAA and the communists face off in a massive shootout inside the school which ends with most people on both sides dead
Cerviño and his plane are followed by one of the few surviving AAA members who shoots him when he lands
While fleeing the shootout at the school Matilda and the other three surviving guerrillas get blown up by Almeido who finishes them off in a suicide bombing
Suprino severely beats Fuentes and then Guglielmini tries to talk him into taking the blame for the whole ordeal
When he refuses Guglielmini and Suprino leave letting Rossi execute Fuentes
While leaving town Suprino realizes Guglielmini plans to frame him for inciting the whole incident so he runs him over with his truck before escaping
When morning finally dawns García and Juan go to Cerviño s house where they find him wounded but still alive
To comfort him in his dying moments they tell him Fuentes won the battle
Cerviño makes them promise to tell General Perón about him if he ever returns to the country after which he dies
Once they ve buried Cerviño Juan and García begin to head into the countryside while discussing the many ways they could convince Perón to return

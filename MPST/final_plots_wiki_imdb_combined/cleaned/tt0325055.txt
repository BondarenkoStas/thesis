The film begins with a shot of Plath sleeping then opening her eyes
As a student at Cambridge she rides along on her red bicycle and wearing an academic gown
She hears of a party to celebrate the publishing of a magazine called St Botolph s where she meets the young poet Ted Hughes
The two fall in love and marry in 1956 then go off to Massachusetts where her mother lives
While they both are teaching at Smith College
Sylvia quickly learns that others are also enthralled with her husband for a combination of his good looks charisma fame and success
They return to England first to London and then to Devon where Sylvia raises their two children and lives in her husband s professional shadow as she tries to eke out her own writing career which doesn t come as naturally to her as it does to Ted
After a visit by David and Assia Wevill who had rented their London flat Sylvia rightly accuses Ted of infidelity
She kicks him out and then begins to write the poems that would be published posthumously in her collection titled Ariel
Sylvia then moves back to London with her children
Ted visits at Christmas and they make love again but he says he cannot leave Assia who is pregnant
Shortly thereafter she prepares for her suicide sealing off the children s room from the gas from her gas oven
A nurse comes to take out the children and Ted sees Plath s manuscript on her desk
A closing title informs us that her book made her much beloved and that Ted wrote his response in 1998 in a collection titled The Birthday Letters

Not long after his adventure with the Golden Goose Puss in Boots is riding his horse through the desert contemplating if he was destined to be an outlaw or a hero when he is captured by Italian knights
He is then taken to Princess Alessandra Belagomba whose Heart of Fire Ruby the crown jewel of her kingdom is missing
At first Puss believes he is being wrongfully charged for the theft but it later turns out that the Princess only wants to hire him based on his reputation revealing that a French thief called The Whisperer was the one who committed the crime and that the Princess knights have captured three of his henchmen
The henchmen turn out to be three kittens
Though Puss cannot believe that such innocent creatures could be thieves the princess and her guards are terrified of them
The Diablos kindly agree to help Puss on the premise that they will be free if they return the ruby
When Puss takes the Diablos to the desert they quickly turn on him and bury him alive
Puss later escapes and recaptures the Diablos using his wide eyes against theirs
Later he talks about sending them back to jail for double crossing him but he learns that they have no family and are orphans like him
He then sympathetically tells them how he also knows it s tough not knowing whom to trust and being betrayed making an example of how Humpty led Puss down the wrong path just as the Whisperer has done to them
Puss then decides to point the Diablos in the right direction and trains them how to fight and plays with them becoming friends
He also gives them names Perla another Gonzalo and the other Sir Timoteo Montenegro the Third
The next day the Diablos turning over a new leaf show Puss to the Whisperer s secret hideout and are immediately confronted by the Whisperer himself who by his name has a low voice volume and uses his hat as a cone to speak clearly
It is also revealed that the Whisperer himself has used the heart as a decoration for his own belt
After learning that the Diablos brought Puss to him to recover the heart the Whisperer is about to punish them for their betrayal but Puss fights him and lets the Diablos escape
They however return to help Puss with what they learned from him and the Whisperer falls into a bottomless pit to his death
Puss then returns the heart to the Princess and is rewarded with gold and he gives the Princess the Diablos as her new personal bodyguards
They then say their goodbyes and Puss claims He will never forget them just as he is sure they will never forget the name of Puss in unfortunately the guards slam the doors before he can finish his goodbye

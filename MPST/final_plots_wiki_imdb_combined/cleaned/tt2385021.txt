Setting Five years have passed since the events of Borderlands when the four Vault Hunters Roland Mordecai Lilith and Brick were guided by a mysterious entity known as The Guardian Angel on the planet of Pandora to the Vault a mysterious alien structure that was rumored to hold ancient and exotic technology and riches
Instead these Vault Hunters were confronted by an alien abomination known as The Destroyer inside the Vault
After defeating The Destroyer a valuable mineral called Eridium started flourishing through Pandora s crust
Handsome Jack the president of the Hyperion Corporation secures this new resource and makes use of it to attempt to bring peace to the planet
Now Handsome Jack rules over the inhabitants of Pandora with an iron fist from his massive satellite built in the shape of an H always visible in the sky in front of Pandora s moon
Meanwhile rumors of an even larger Vault hidden on Pandora spread across the galaxy drawing a new group of Vault Hunters to the planet in search of it
Story The opening cutscene introduces the four new Vault Hunters who are betrayed by Jack and left for dead in a frozen wasteland
The Vault Hunters are found by the last remaining Hyperion CL4P TP unit
The Guardian Angel contacts the Vault Hunters and instructs them to accompany Claptrap to the city of Sanctuary and to join the Crimson Raiders an anti Hyperion resistance movement in order to defeat Handsome Jack
Upon arriving at the gates of Sanctuary the Vault Hunters are asked to rescue Roland now leader of the Crimson Raiders who has been captured by a bounty hunter called the Firehawk
The Vault Hunters meet the Firehawk who turns out to be Lilith whose powers as a Siren have been significantly enhanced by the new supply of eridium
Lilith informs the Vault Hunters that Roland was actually captured by a group of bandits
After fighting through the bandits territory the Vault Hunters rescue Roland and return to Sanctuary
Roland and Lilith learn that the Vault Key is being transported aboard a Hyperion train and ask the Vault Hunters to retrieve it
To accomplish the mission the Vault Hunters enlist the aid of former Vault Hunter Mordecai and of Tiny Tina a psychotic explosives obsessed thirteen year old
The Vault Hunters derail the train but instead of finding the Vault Key they encounter Wilhelm a powerful Hyperion cyborg
After Wilhelm s defeat the Vault Hunters recover his power core which Roland recommends be used as the power source for Sanctuary s shields
The power core turns out to be a trap it allows the Guardian Angel who is actually working for Jack to lower the city s shields and render it vulnerable to a bombardment from the Hyperion moon satellite
Lilith saves Sanctuary which was originally a large spacecraft by activating its engines and teleporting it away for the rest of the game Sanctuary exists as a flying city in the sky
Jack s plan is to open Pandora s second Vault and unleash The Warrior a powerful lava eridium and rock creature controlled by whomever releases it he uses Angel to help him charge the Vault Key more quickly than usual
Angel communicates with the group in Sanctuary and despite hostile treatment from Roland divulges that the Vault Key is kept with her in a Hyperion facility
She also shares information about the formidable defenses of the facility
The Vault Hunters embark upon a series of missions in order to assemble what is needed to overcome these defenses including obtaining an upgrade for Claptrap visiting the Hyperion city of Opportunity and enlisting the aid of Brick now leader of the Slab clan of bandits
During the process Mordecai s pet bird Bloodwing is captured and killed by Handsome Jack an enraged Mordecai vows revenge and joins the other three former Vault Hunters at Sanctuary
Roland and the Vault Hunters assault the Hyperion compound and meet Angel who is not only a real person but a siren and Handsome Jack s daughter
She requests to be killed in order to stop her father from charging the Vault Key and gaining control of The Warrior
Handsome Jack sends in waves of security forces in order to protect his daughter but ultimately Roland and the Vault Hunters with the help of late arrival Lilith successfully kill Angel
An enraged Handsome Jack teleports in kills Roland and captures Lilith whom he forces to resume charging the Vault Key in Angel s stead
Lilith manages to teleport the Vault Hunters out of the facility and back to Sanctuary
Mordecai and Brick decide to learn the location of the second Vault and confront Handsome Jack and The Warrior
While the Vault Hunters travel to the Hyperion Information Annex and obtains the Vault s location the two steal a Hyperion ship

Ultimately the Vault Hunters confront battle and defeat Handsome Jack himself but arrive too late to prevent him from opening the Vault
Handsome Jack summons The Warrior a gargantuan dragon like lava creature and orders it to kill the Vault Hunters
After a long battle the Vault Hunters defeat the Warrior and execute Handsome Jack in the aftermath
Brick and Mordecai arrive just as Lilith attempts to destroy the Vault Key

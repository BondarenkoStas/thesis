Background The game is presented against the background of the history of the One Ring
At the dawn of the Second Age after the defeat of the Dark Lord Morgoth the elves of Eregion forged the nineteen Rings of Power to help themselves the dwarves and men rule Middle earth
However the elves were unaware that Sauron Morgoth s closest ally had survived his master s defeat and in the guise of Annatar had been the one who taught the Elven smiths led by Celebrimbor how to forge the Rings whilst in secret he forged his own One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom a Ring far more powerful than any of the others
However in order for the One Ring to be powerful enough to control the other Rings Sauron had to transfer most of his power into it
As soon as he put it on the elves became aware of his ruse removing and hiding their Three Rings which Celebrimbor had forged without Sauron s aid
Sauron waged war on the elves conquering much of Middle earth and killing Celebrimbor
Thus began the Dark Years when Sauron took possession of the remaining sixteen Rings giving seven to the dwarves and nine to men in an effort to corrupt them
The dwarves proved relatively immune to the powers of the Rings acquiring only a greed for gold and becoming unconcerned with events in the wider world
Men proved less resilient and the nine kings given the Rings become the nine Ring wraiths or Nazgûl led by the Witch king of Angmar
In his ongoing efforts to conquer Middle earth Sauron regained the allegiance of many of Morgoth s servants from the First Age and successfully corrupted Númenor
However in doing so he expended a great deal of his power and lost the ability to ever again assume a pleasing disguise
Returning to Mordor he regained his strength eventually capturing Minas Ithil
However realizing that if they did not join together Sauron would destroy both men and elves Elendil High King of Arnor and Gil galad High King of Noldor formed the Last Alliance of Men and Elves and attacked Sauron in his fortress Barad dûr
The alliance was victorious with Isildur cutting the One Ring from Sauron s hand
However although presented with a chance to destroy the Ring forever Isildur already beginning to succumb to its corruption chose not to do so
As such although Sauron s physical form was vanquished his spirit bound to the Ring survived
Some time later Isildur was attacked and killed by a band of orcs and the Ring was lost in the river Anduin for over two thousand years
Meanwhile during the Third Age a still weakened Sauron covertly established a stronghold at Dol Guldur
In response to this undetermined evil the Valar sent five Maiar to Middle earth
Taking the form of wizards they were led by Saruman
Unsure of the origin of the evil power in Dol Guldur the wizard Gandalf was sent to investigate
However Sauron hid from Gandalf waiting for four hundred years before returning
Around the same time the One Ring was found by a Hobbit named Sméagol who became utterly corrupted by it living in the caves of the Misty Mountains and physically transforming into a creature known as Gollum
For five hundred years Gollum was consumed and corrupted by the Ring
Eventually Gandalf was able to determine the evil presence in Dol Guldur was indeed Sauron
Gandalf reported back to the White Council but Saruman dissuaded them from moving against Sauron
Only when he learned the One Ring may be in the vicinity of the Gladden Fields did Saruman agree to attack Sauron hoping to find the Ring himself
The Council drove Sauron from Dol Guldur unaware that he knew the Ring had been found
Just prior to Sauron s departure the Ring passed to another hobbit Bilbo Baggins who used it to assist in the victory of elves men and dwarves at the Battle of the Five Armies
Sixty years later Gollum was captured by orcs and taken to Mordor where he was tortured into revealing the owner and location of the Ring Bilbo Baggins of the Shire
In the meantime Bilbo had left the Shire to live in Rivendell and upon the advice of Gandalf had given the Ring to his nephew Frodo Baggins
With the information given him by Gollum Sauron still unable to take physical form thus sent the Nazgûl to the Shire to retrieve the One Ring
Frodo and his friends Samwise Gamgee Peregrin Pippin Took and Meriadoc Merry Brandybuck managed to escape the Shire and head towards Bree
Plot The game begins with Eradan Andriel and Farin arriving at the Prancing Pony in Bree where they meet Aragorn informing him that three days previously the Dúnedain guard at Sarn Ford was attacked by the Nazgûl who passed into the Shire
After the raid the Witch king of Angmar met with a Black Númenórean named Agandaûr who told the Witch king his orcs are forming an army in the ruins of Fornost as per Sauron s command
Aragorn explains that a Hobbit with a great burden is on his way to Bree and if the enemy take the object from him it will mean certain doom for the Free peoples of Middle earth
As such he asks the trio to distract the orcs at Fornost
In Fornost the trio rescue a Great Eagle imprisoned by orcs
Revealing his name is Beleram an eagle from the Misty Mountains in the service of Gwaihir they tell him of Agandaûr and he offers to help
They then encounter Elladan and Elrohir the sons of Elrond who they also tell of Agandaûr and their mission to distract him
The twins however suggest they may be able to destroy Agandaûr
In the citadel at the center of the ruins the group fight their way to the top where they face Agandaûr who leaps from the roof onto a waiting Fell beast
Unable to predict Agandaûr s next move each of the group elects to return to their respective superiors Beleram to Gwaihir in the Misty Mountains Elladan and Elrohir to Elrond in Rivendell and the trio to their captain Halbarad at Sarn Ford
Halbarad tells them Aragorn left Bree in the company of four hobbits heading towards Rivendell and he advises them to follow
After passing through the Barrow downs they reach Rivendell where they are welcomed by Elrond Gandalf and Aragorn who explain the Hobbit Frodo Baggins is in possession of the One Ring which must be destroyed by casting it into fires of Mount Doom
A fellowship of nine has thus been formed to carry the Ring to its destruction
The trio ask how they may help and Gandalf explains the immediate concern is Agandaûr as his mission and location are unknown
Elrond speculates he may be planning an attack on Rivendell and as such it is likely he has gone to the Ettenmoors to strengthen his army with trolls
The trio head to investigate the Ettenmoors where they again encounter Beleram who tells them the orcs and trolls in the region have formed an army under a Stone giant named Bargrisar who is waging war on the Eagles and as such several Eagles have come to the Ettenmoors to kill him
The trio agree to help eventually finding and weakening Bargrisar allowing Beleram to kill him
They are then joined by Gwaihir and two other eagles Baranthor and Armenel
Gwaihir speculates Bargrisar must have been operating under the command of someone else
The trio return to Rivendell with Beleram Baranthor and Armenel where Elrond says the Fellowship have safely departed
He has also found evidence of Mount Gundabad orcs operating in the Ettenmoors
The eagles drop the trio near Gundabad and as they climb they see a massive army of orcs gathering in the valley
Once inside the fortress they find the bodies of many dwarfs with a dying dwarf telling them a group of dwarves came to Gundabad to activate a secret weapon with which to destroy the orc army
He tells them that Nordri has the key with which to operate the weapon and is still alive within the chambers
The trio locate Nordri who along with Bruni is attempting to activate the weapon
The trio assist them and once the weapon is activated a horn sounds the reverberations of which cause the fortress to start collapsing
The dwarves explain the weapon s function is to destroy the entire fortress
However the Eagles then fly into the chamber rescuing the trio and the two dwarves and taking them to the dwarves home Nordinbad a secret mountain stronghold on the edge of Rhovanion
Nordri introduces the trio to his father Gorin Lord of Nordinbad who tell them he fears Agandaûr may be attempting to ally himself with Úrgost a Dragon who lives nearby
The trio volunteer to approach Úrgost and find out
They learn that Úrgost has been approached by Agandaûr who offered him Nordinbad in return for assisting in the destruction of the North
However Agandaûr does not yet possess Nordinbad and Úrgost will not join him until he does
In any case Úrgost has no real interest in Nordinbad
Instead he wants Carn Dûm a fortress in Angmar which is currently occupied by Agandaûr
Úrgost does not wish to make an enemy of Sauron by taking the fortress from Sauron s ally
He proposes the trio take the fortress instead and turn it over to him
In return he will remain neutral in the war
He also tells them if they wish to save Nordinbad they should hurry as it is under siege as they speak
They head back to find Bruni has been killed with Nordri coordinating the defenses
The eagles attack the siege towers whilst the trio help defend the courtyard
Nordinbad is successfully defended although Baranthor and Armenel are killed and Beleram is seriously wounded
The dwarves take Beleram inside to tend to his injuries as the trio head to Carn Dûm to face Agandaûr
They fight their way towards the summit but are attacked by a fell beast
Suddenly Beleram appears killing the beast
Still injured he tells them he will be there for them should they need him in the fight against Agandaûr
They confront Agandaûr and as they fight Beleram attacks lifting Agandaûr into the air
However Agandaûr is able to stab and kill him
The distraction however allows the trio to strike killing Agandaûr
As he dies he calls on Sauron for aid
However nothing happens
Úrgost then arrives telling the trio that Sauron has been defeated and the Ring destroyed
He takes possession of Carn Dûm as the trio begin the journey back to Rivendell
In an alternative ending in which the player does not call on Beleram for support during the fight with Agandaûr Beleram survives and joins them on the journey home

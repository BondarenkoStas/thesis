Continuing from Porky s Duck Hunt Porky with Barnyard Dawg are hunting ducks
Daffy sneaks up behind them in a giant fake duck and empties the shot from their shells then walks off with a silly laugh and the phrase Duck hunters is the cwaziest peoples

Daffy taunts Porky into shooting at him
Porky shoots at Daffy but turns out to have missed him
Daffy again taunts Porky by breaking out into a can can dance and singing Latin Quarter from Gold Diggers in Paris
Porky shoots at Daffy again as Daffy finishes his routine by bending over to reveal a bulls eye painted on his backside
Daffy pretends to have been shot but leaves the scene
Porky sends his dog to get Daffy and the dog decides to trick Daffy crying loudly that Porky will torture him if he doesn t come back with a duck
Daffy agrees to let the dog capture him and plays dead
The dog carries him back to a delighted Porky and they leave the pond
Once they get back to Porky s house Porky throws Daffy in the freezer and goes upstairs for a nap
Once out of sight Daffy starts knocking on the freezer door to be let out
After a brief fight between his good and bad conscience the dog lets Daffy out of the freezer
Daffy tries to leave the house claiming in a non sequitur There s a guy waitin for me
but is blocked by the dog
After making a bunch of noise Daffy jumps into the dog s mouth just as Porky comes to see what all the noise is about
Upon coming down Porky thinks the dog is trying to steal the duck for himself and subsequently beats him
Porky then throws Daffy back in the freezer
The dog now wants to get revenge against Daffy but Daffy continues to act silly around him
When Porky appears wondering what all the noise is about Daffy once again jumps into the dog s mouth
A furious Porky once again thinks his dog is stealing Daffy and pounds him once again
Porky then places Daffy back into the freezer
Finally the dog has had enough and grabs an axe to finish Daffy off
Daffy runs to Porky s bedroom where the pig is asleep
Daffy puts a flower pot on Porky and barks
When Daffy ducks down and crawls away out of the room the dog accidentally hits the flower pot with the axe and an enraging Porky calls him a Benedict Arnold and a traitor
After a chase through the house Porky finally having enough of the dog s shenanigans comes into the kitchen and threatens the dog s life if Daffy isn t in the freezer
Porky opens the freezer but both are shocked when Daffy dressed as Santa Claus jumps out and starts singing Jingle Bells
Both Porky and the dog start singing along with Daffy until Porky sees that the current month is April on the calendar
As the dog looks in horror and runs behind the freezer Porky angrily knocks Daffy down onto the floor and is ready to use the axe until he sees a stamp on Daffy Do not open till Xmas
Daffy smiles at the camera and says to the audience Christmas by that time I ll figure a way out of this mess
The cartoon ends with an iris out around his left eye which closes

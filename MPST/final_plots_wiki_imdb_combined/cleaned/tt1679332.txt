The film opens with a group of Space Marines of the Imperial Fists Chapter under attack from an unknown enemy
A Space Marine by the name of Nidon is told to protect the Codex and races to obey his orders just before a fireball engulfs them all
Elsewhere aboard a Space Marine Strike Cruiser Brother Proteus and Captain Severus of the Ultramarines Chapter spar in a training duel
Proteus manages to disarm Severus however he quickly escapes Proteus s grasp and in turn defeats him proclaiming that a Space Marine never yields
The members of Ultima Squad are then shown a sacred weapon in their ship s reclusium a Relic Thunder Hammer
The Captain and his right hand man Apothecary Pythol lead the initiates in a swearing in ceremony on the Hammer
With the ceremony finished Ultima Squad prepare themselves for their first mission a sortie to the planet of Mithron
In orbit above the planet Captain Severus departs the cruiser with only the Ultima Squad highly eager to prove themselves in battle for support
En route to the planet s surface Severus addresses the squad informing them of the distress call received shortly before all contact with the planet was lost and how it is still unclear whether it is automated or not
Soon they are on the tough and unforgiving surface of Mithron and the only location of importance is a shrine guarded by 100 Imperial Fists
Ultima Squad quickly discovers that a terrible battle has taken place with the garrison force annihilated and the planet s Imperial shrine desecrated
It is also evident that the forces of Chaos are responsible and Severus decides they must continue the mission to search for any remaining survivors
While approaching the ruins the Ultramarines are ambushed by the Black Legion
Three Ultramarines are killed but the ambush is thwarted
The squad continues on and in a dark passage of the shrine they are attacked by a Daemon Prince which grapples with Severus and they both fall through the wall and down a ravine
With Severus gone and Crastor dead command of the squad falls to Proteus who decides to continue with the mission
Progressing to the reliquary at the shrine s summit they find Chaplain Carnak and Brother Nidon the sole surviving Imperial Fists
They reveal they have been protecting the Liber Mithrus an ancient sacred Codex given by the The God Emperor of Mankind himself
Ultima Squad agrees to help escort the book to safety but Verenor and Proteus remain suspicious questioning how just the two of them have managed to survive for so long
As Ultima Squad retreat to the extraction point they are attacked by a huge force of Chaos Space Marines
During the fight they suffer heavy casualties and just as they are about to be overwhelmed Severus suddenly reappears and aids their escape
Back on board Proteus confides to Severus his suspicions of Carnak and Nidon believing that they may have been tainted by Chaos
They confront the Imperial Fists with Severus taking the book and discovering that it is blank
When Hypax enters with the Ultramarines standard it ignites indicating the presence of Chaos
Severus declares that Carnak has been tainted and kills him
Nidon becomes enraged and attacks Severus but is easily thrown off and knocked unconscious
Hypax questions why the standard continues to burn with Carnak dead and it clear that Severus was possessed by the Daemon that he fought
Hypax charges the daemon and pushes it into the armoury
When Proteus and Nidon regain consciousness they find both Hypax and Decius slain
Accompanied by Nidon the three confront Severus in the ship s reclusium
Severus assumes daemon form and reveals its plans to possess Proteus and infiltrate the Ultramarines homeworld of Macragge
Pythol arrives in time to save Proteus but is killed
Using the diversion Proteus then takes the Thunder Hammer to kill Severus and banish the daemon possessing him
Later it is shown that Proteus is promoted to Sergeant with Verenor as his second in command and the final scene mirrors the opening one showing the new recruits swearing on the sacred hammer

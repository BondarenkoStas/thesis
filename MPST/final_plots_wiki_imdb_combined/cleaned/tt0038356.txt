In this cartoon within a cartoon Bugs and Elmer are in the midst of their usual hunting chasing scenario
After Bugs tricks Elmer into running through a hollow log and off a cliff three times Elmer becomes enraged and frustrated that the writers never let him catch the rabbit in the pictures they both appear in
He tears up his Warner Bros cartoon contract and walks off the set to devote his life to fishing stunning Bugs who piteously protests and effortlessly tries to ask him to reconsider
During a relaxing fishing trip Elmer falls asleep
Bugs observes Elmer s nap and takes sleeping pills in order to rock Elmer s dreamboat crosses over Elmer s head
Elmer s anger at a failed pursuit through the surreal landscape down connected rabbit holes is promptly used against him by Bugs who inquires What s the matter doc ya cold
Here I ll fix dat
Before Elmer can protest Bugs dresses him like a woman by wrapping his body with green material from the right slapping a wig on him and applying lipstick
Bugs inspects his handiwork then lifts the backdrop to reveal a trio of literal wolves lounging by the sign at Hollywood and Vine
When the trio notice Elmer one wolf hollers Hooooow old is she
right before another wolf begins flirting with Elmer
Bugs enjoys watching the male wolves hit on Elmer who yells Gwacious
before he grabs the hem of his gown and flees from the wolves who give chase briefly stopping to ask the audience Have any of you giwls evew had an expewience wike this
In an attempt to help Bugs persuades Elmer to follow a mad dash towards stage right as Bugs plays the old gag run this way
putting Elmer through a bizarre series of steps which include running on his feet flipping upside down to run on his hair hopping like a frog as well as Russian folk dancing
As Bugs and Elmer dive off a cliff Bugs drinks some Hare Tonic and screeches to a halt in mid air while the dream Elmer continues to careen toward earth finally crash landing into the real Elmer s snoozing body as he wakes up with a start exclaiming Ooh what a howwible nightmare
Elmer dashes back to the cartoon s original set pieces his Warner contract back together and agrees to finish what he started
The chase through the log begins anew
Bugs faces the audience in a closeup closing with the catchphrase from the Beulah character on the radio show Fibber McGee and Molly Ah love dat man

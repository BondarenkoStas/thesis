The voice of General Dwight D Eisenhower is also heard reminiscing about the experiences of the battle
Archival news footage is also used in some cases with the characters inserted through rotoscoping
While proceeding up north they head towards Ypres which Linus recognized as the site of a series of battles during World War I
They arrive at a field of red poppies which grew throughout the wastelands of battles fought during the war and which serves as a marker for the Ypres battle site
Linus then recites the poem In Flanders Fields after directing the group to the British field dressing station where McCrae was inspired to write the poem
They come away realizing what the impact of the wars were and how important the sacrifice of the soldiers was
Standing among the field of red poppies Linus then turns and asks What have we learned Charlie Brown

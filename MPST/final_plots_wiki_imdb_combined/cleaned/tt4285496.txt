The film tells two stories thirty years apart both featuring Karamakate an Amazonian shaman and last survivor of his tribe
He travels with two scientists firstly with German Theo von Martius in 1909 and American named Evan in 1940 to look for the rare yakruna a sacred plant
Theo an ethnographer from TÃ¼bingen who has already resided in the Amazon for several years is very sick and is travelling by canoe with his field notes and a westernised local he saved from enslavement on a rubber plantation named Manduca
Karamakate prolongs his life blasting white powder called the sun s semen up his nose but is reluctant to become involved with a westerner and refuses his money
Theo is searching for yakruna as the only cure for his disease and the three set off in the canoe to search for it
Many years later an American botanist Evan paddles up to a much older Karamakate who has apparently forgotten the customs of his own people
Evan says he is hoping to complete Theo s quest and Karamakate does assist again reluctantly saying his knowledge is spent
Evan has a book of Theo s final trek which his aide sent back to Europe as he did not survive the jungle
The book includes an image of Karamakate which he refers to as his chullachaqui a native term for hollow spirit
Karamakate agrees to help him only when Evan describes himself as someone who has devoted himself to plants although Evan s real purpose is actually to secure disease free rubber trees since the United States s supplies of rubber from South East Asia had dwindled due to the Japanese wartime advance
Both expeditions feature an Apocalypse Now style Spanish Catholic Mission by the side of an Amazon tributary run in 1909 by a sadistic lone Spanish priest who beats orphan boys for any pagan behaviour and in 1940 by a delusional Brazilian figure who believes he is the Messiah
He only trusts the visitors when he believes they are the Biblical Magi but Karamakate wins his respect when he heals his wife
By now the children of 1909 have grown into disturbed and violent acolytes
In 1909 we are left with Theo sick and having fled the Mission arriving at a frontier post just about to be invaded by Colombian soldiers during the Amazon rubber boom where the sacred yakruna is being abused by drunken men and cultivated against local traditions
Karamakate is furious and destroys it
In 1940 Karamakate does show Evan the origin of the plant in striking denuded dome shaped mountains allegedly the home of yakruna
He reveals one yakruna flower that is on the last plant he has destroyed all the others and prepares it for Evan
The preparation being hallucinogenic aids Evan in undergoing a superconscious experience
A part of this experience has been shown in colour to signify its intensity
The film ends with a transformed Evan remaining enamoured by a group of butterflies

Lankester Merrin is a veteran Catholic priest and exorcist who is on an archaeological dig in Iraq
There he finds an amulet that resembles the statue of Pazuzu a demon whom Merrin had defeated years before
Merrin then realizes the demon has returned to seek revenge
Meanwhile in Georgetown actress Chris MacNeil is living on location with her 12 year old daughter Regan where Chris has just wrapped the final scene of a film about student activism directed by her friend and associate Burke Dennings
After playing with a Ouija board and contacting a supposedly imaginary friend whom she calls Captain Howdy Regan begins acting strangely including making mysterious noises stealing constantly using obscene language and exhibiting abnormal strength
Chris hosts a party only for Regan to come downstairs unannounced telling one of the guests who is an astronaut You re gonna die up there and then urinating on the floor
Regan s bed also begins to shake violently much to her and her mother s horror
Chris consults multiple physicians but Dr Klein and his associates find nothing medically wrong with her daughter despite Regan undergoing a battery of diagnostic tests
One night when Chris is out Burke Dennings is babysitting Regan only for Chris to come home to hear he has died falling out the window
Although this is assumed to have been an accident given Burke s history of heavy drinking his death is investigated by Lieutenant William Kinderman who interviews Chris as well as priest and psychiatrist Father Damien Karras who has had his faith in God severely weakened and left badly shaken after the death of his frail mother
The doctors thinking that Regan only believes she is possessed recommend an exorcism to be performed
Chris arranges a meeting with Karras
After recording Regan speaking backwards and witnessing the etching of the words Help Me on her stomach Karras is convinced Regan is possessed
Believing her soul is in danger he decides to perform an exorcism
The experienced Merrin is selected to do so instead with Karras present to assist
Both priests witness Regan perform a series of bizarre vulgar acts and confine her to her bedroom
They attempt to exorcise the demon but a stubborn Pazuzu toys with them especially Karras
Karras shows weakness and is dismissed by Merrin who attempts the exorcism alone
Karras enters the room and discovers Merrin has died of a heart attack
After failing to revive Merrin the enraged Karras confronts the mocking laughing spirit of Pazuzu tackling the demon to the ground
At Karras s furious demand Pazuzu then possesses Karras leaving Regan s body
In a moment of self sacrifice the priest throws himself out of the window without allowing Pazuzu to compel him to harm Regan and is himself mortally injured
Father Dyer an old friend of Karras happens upon the scene and administers the last rites to his friend
A few days later Regan who is now back to her normal self prepares to leave for Los Angeles with her mother
Although Regan has no apparent recollection of her possession she gives Father Dyer a kiss a likely hint at posthumous thanks to Father Merrin and Father Karras
Kinderman who narrowly misses their departure befriends Father Dyer as he investigates Karras s death

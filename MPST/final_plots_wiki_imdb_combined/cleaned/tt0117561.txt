Although the film does not have a linear plot a skeletal structure exists telling the same story from three different perspectives divided into three acts
At the beginning of the film Soderbergh speaks to the audience in a style meant to evoke Cecil B DeMille s introduction to The Ten Commandments
He states In the event that you find certain sequences or ideas confusing please bear in mind that this is your fault not ours
You will need to see the picture again and again until you understand everything
Act 1 The film s main character is Fletcher Munson an office employee working under Theodore Azimuth Schwitters
Schwitters is the leader of a self help company religion lifestyle known as Eventualism a clear reference to L Ron Hubbard and Scientology
The audience sees the events unfold in the opening act through Fletcher s point of view
Fletcher sees the underlying meaning in everything paying more attention to what is meant rather than what is said
As he progresses through his day the audience sees the lack of attention he is paying to the people around him degrading to the point where he comes home for dinner and he and his wife illustrate their lack of communication by simply describing what they are saying
Fletcher Generic greeting
Wife Generic greeting returned
Fletcher Imminent sustenance
Wife Overly dramatic statement regarding upcoming meal
Fletcher Oooh false reaction indicating hunger and excitement
When Fletcher s co worker Lester Richards unexpectedly dies while getting pictures developed at the drugstore Fletcher must take his job as speechwriter for Schwitters
His personal life suffers because of his work and he becomes even more detached from his wife who is trying to cope by having an affair
Meanwhile Elmo Oxygen a local exterminator spends much of his time going from house to house bedding the bored housewives of the men in the community who work for Schwitters
In each house he takes pictures of his genitals using various cameras he finds on tables and in cabinets
Elmo and the women speak in a nonsensical code that for all its complexity clearly conveys amorous intent Housewife Arsenal
Nose army
Elmo Nose army
Beef diaper
Housewife Nomenclature
As Elmo makes his rounds he is followed by a couple in an SUV
Fletcher finishes this act in a parking lot
Finding that his key will not work in his car door he looks around and finds that his actual car is an exact match for the one he is trying to get into
He goes to enter his own car when he sees a man who is his exact double climb into the car he himself just tried to enter
Fletcher follows his doppelganger home closes his eyes and becomes this mystery man
Act 2 Although the second act begins as a direct transition from the first its events actually unfold simultaneously with the previous act
The second act follows Fletcher s doppelganger one Dr Jeffrey Korchek
Korchek is a conservative dentist who has been mentioned by one or two smaller characters in the first act
He is always in a jogging suit although he only jogs from his car to the door of wherever he is going
He is also quite a fan of Muzak
Korchek it turns out is the mystery man that Fletcher s wife has been having an affair with causing Fletcher Korchek to comment Oh my god
I m having an affair with my wife
Despite being with essentially the same man Mrs Munson seems to feel comfortable with Dr Korchek
The communication is better and she feels needed and wanted
Korchek suggests she leave Fletcher and move in with him
The next day Korchek has breakfast with his heroin addicted brother who first asks to stay with Korchek and then to borrow money
Korchek says he can t help and that his brother should not be dealing with drug dealers anyway
The brother disagrees and Korchek goes to work
Once there he meets Attractive Woman Number 2
Korchek falls instantly in love with her and writes a letter professing his love
Dear attractive woman number 2 only once in my life have I responded to a person the way I ve responded to you but I ve forgotten when it was or even if it was in fact me that responded
I may not know much but I know that the wind sings your name endlessly although with a slight lisp that makes it difficult to understand if I m standing near an air conditioner
I know that your hair sits atop your head as though it could sit nowhere else
I know that your figure would make a sculptor cast aside his tools injuring his assistant who was looking out the window instead of paying attention
I know that your lips are as full as that sexy French model that I desperately want to fuck
I know that if for an instant I could have you lie next to me or on top of me or sit on me or stand over me and shake then I would be the happiest man in my pants
I know all of this and yet you do not know me
Change your life accept my love
Or at least let me pay you to accept it
He leaves this note on her door and goes home
Once there he sees a car parked in the driveway
It is Mrs Munson who has considered the offer and has left Fletcher
Korchek has to admit that he has fallen in love with someone else
Mrs Munson is justifiably upset and leaves
The next day Korchek gets to work and is confronted by a large man who says Your brother eight hours fifteen thousand dollars
In fact almost all of this man s dialog consists of some combination of these three commands
Korchek goes into the office and finds a registered letter from a law firm representing Attractive Woman Number 2 who is filing a sexual harassment suit against Dr Korchek
The day goes from bad to worse when it is revealed that Korchek s brother has stolen all of his money
Broke tired loveless and depressed Korchek leaves work only to find that the large man s time limit has elapsed
Korchek is shot dead
During this act the couple following Elmo in the SUV approaches him to give up playing his role in the film in order to become a star in his own action show
Contrary to the experience of the other characters Elmo s storyline seems to move forward in time continuously without rewinding repeating between acts
Act 3 The final act is seen through the perspective of Mrs Munson
We move through the storyline again and see her experience with Fletcher s growing disaffection Dr Korchek s affection and the day to day routine of being a mom
The action follows roughly the same events except that Fletcher and his doppelganger speak Japanese Italian or French with the cultural stereotype of each nationality reflecting Mrs Munson s perception of the men
This is in a similar vein to the generic greetings of the earlier act
Once she leaves Korchek she makes a tired reconciliation with Fletcher and they go home together
Fletcher finishes Schwitters speech and all seems to be well
The day of the speech Schwitters mounts the podium and prepares to give the oration which is by all accounts quite good
After acknowledging applause with a Thank you Elmo who has been missing for this entire act bursts into the auditorium and shoots Schwitters in the shoulder
Schwitters survives and Elmo is arrested
After nonsensical ranting repeating nose army again and again Elmo exposes his crotch during a police interrogation
The police recoil and shield their eyes implying that Lester Richards may have died the same way at beginning of the film after seeing photos of Elmo at the drugstore
The movie ends with a pair of monologues
First Munson is seen in a shopping mall narrating the events of the rest of his life his wife will leave him in five years in eight years he will drunkenly collapse and fall asleep in a snowbank after a wedding reception in Alaska and be discovered and successfully thawed the following spring
Then Soderbergh returns in front of a blank movie screen and asks if there are any questions
After offering several responses he walks offstage as the camera pulls back to reveal he s been talking to an empty auditorium
Credits The film has no beginning or end credits
A man clad only in a black T shirt appears at the beginning and conclusion of the film shown to be chased by men in white coats over a green field
When he is first seen the T shirt sports the title of the film in his later appearance it says The End
There is a single frame of copyright information at the end of the film

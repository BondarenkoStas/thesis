Since she has cancer and doctors inform her that she will die soon Maimoona seeks her brother s help in arranging Khirad s marriage
To compensate for not taking better care of Maimoona Baseerat promises that Ashar will marry Khirad
This irks Farida who has always wanted Ashar to marry his cousin Sara the daughter of Farida s sister Zarina Ajmal
In spite of their reluctance Ashar and Khirad are married moments before Maimoona passes away
Sara who is in love with Ashar is heartbroken upon learning this and attempts suicide
Both Ashar and Khirad are aloof towards each other and feel uncomfortable in the forced marriage
Ashar still promises Khirad that he will attempt to maintain a stable relationship
Khirad feels that by marrying a man who is financially superior she has lost her self respect
Gradually the duo fall deeply in love with each other
Ashar admires Khirad s innocence simplicity and purity of heart his admiration is reciprocated by Khirad who is in awe of his caring personality
While he develops a strong and loving relationship with his wife Ashar remains friends with Sara
When she humiliates Khirad Ashar reprimands her for her callousness
Soon Baseerat becomes ill and on his death bed he reminds his son that it is important for him to always look after Khirad
Encouraged by Ashar Khirad enrolls in university for graduate studies
She meets Khizar Sara s paternal cousin who has strong feelings for Sara
In order to win her affection he agrees when he is asked to create misunderstandings between Khirad and Ashar
He begins to visit their house while praising and flirting with Khirad this makes Ashar increasingly paranoid and jealous
Farida offers Khizar a deal to receive money and Sara s hand in marriage he must convince Ashar that he is having an affair with Khirad
In the meantime Khirad discovers that she is pregnant with Ashar s child and plans to surprise him
Khizar invites Khirad to his apartment and alongside Farida and Zarina successfully causes Ashar to witness what appears to be Khizar and Khirad s intimacy
Farida pretends to be outraged at Khirad s supposed adultery and insults her while Ashar listens tearfully
Khirad protests and calls Khizar who continuously insists that they had an affair
Leaving no chance for Ashar to speak to her Farida exiles Khirad from the house
Before taking refuge with her mother s old friend Batool Bano in Hyderabad Khirad leaves a note for Ashar in which she proclaims her innocence and reveals her pregnancy
She desperately attempts to contact Ashar however he refuses to listen to her
A few months later Khirad goes into labour and tries to contact Ashar one last time who ignores her phone call
Khirad gives birth to a baby girl and names her Hareem she vows that she will never forgive Ashar for what he did to her
Four years later Khirad reluctantly returns to Karachi where she visits Ashar to seek financial assistance for Hareem who needs open heart surgery
He initially refuses to help and fails to believe that Hareem is his daughter but relents and also allows them to stay at his house by believing Hareem is his daughter
When Sara discovers that Khirad has returned she confronts Ashar and informs Farida who returns from a trip to America and threatens to exile Khirad once again
In retaliation Khirad threatens to tell Ashar the truth behind their misunderstanding
Ashar informs Sara that he has never loved her and suggests that she should stop pursuing him
Khizar arrives from America and blackmails Farida by threatening to reveal Khirad s innocence if Sara does not marry him
Farida urges Sara to marry Khizar but Sara and her mother refuse and blames Farida for ruining Sara s life
Meanwhile Hareem s operation is successful and Ashar finds that his feelings for Khirad have rekindled
Zareena is disturbed by Sara s everlasting depression which stems from Ashar s rejection and her refusal to love anyone else
Ashar attempts to reconcile with Khirad citing their daughter but she rejects him and decides to leave Hareem in his care
Having realized that Sara will never marry him Khizar visits Ashar to reveal the truth but an angered Ashar has him escorted out by security
The incident sparks the memories of Ashar s past with his wife and in his sorrow he accidentally discovers the letter that Khirad left for him which Farida had hidden
Ashar then overhears his mother s conversation with Khizar and finally learns of their connivance
Sara commits suicide and her mother blames Farida for her misery
With the pretense that Hareem has fallen ill Ashar asks Khirad to return from Hyderabad who is living with her mother s old friend Batool Bano He then confronts Farida accusing her of destroying his life and simultaneously blames himself for failing to trust his wife
Farida loses her sanity when she realizes what she has done
Ashar begs for Khirad s forgiveness and asks her to return to his life she finally forgives him and they reconcile
Three months later the two are shown to be living a happy life with their daughter

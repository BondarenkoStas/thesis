Judgment at Nuremberg centers on a military tribunal convened in Nuremberg Germany in which four German judges and prosecutors stand accused of crimes against humanity for their involvement in atrocities committed under the Nazi regime
Judge Dan Haywood is the Chief Trial Judge of a three judge panel that will hear and decide the case against the defendants
Haywood begins his examination by trying to learn how the defendant Ernst Janning could have sentenced so many people to death
Janning it is revealed is a well educated and internationally respected jurist and legal scholar
Haywood seeks to understand how the German people could have turned blind eyes and deaf ears to the crimes of the Nazi regime
In doing so he befriends the widow of a German general who had been executed by the Allies
He talks with a number of Germans who have different perspectives on the war
Other characters the judge meets are US Army Captain Byers who is assigned to the American party hearing the cases and Irene Hoffmann who is afraid to provide testimony that may bolster the prosecution s case against the judges
German defense attorney Hans Rolfe argues that the defendants were not the only ones to aid or at least turn a blind eye to the Nazi regime
He also suggests that the United States has committed acts just as bad or worse as those the Nazis perpetrated
He raises several points in these arguments such as U S Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr s support for the first eugenics practices the German Vatican Reichskonkordat of 1933 which the Nazi dominated German government exploited as an implicit foreign recognition of Nazi leadership Stalin s part in the Nazi Soviet Pact of 1939 which removed the last major obstacle standing in the way of Germany s invasion and occupation of western Poland initiating World War II and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the final stage of the war in August 1945
Janning meanwhile decides to take the stand for the prosecution stating that he is guilty of the crime he is accused of condemning to death a Jewish man of blood defilement charges namely that the man slept with a 16 year old Gentile girl when he knew there was no evidence to support such a verdict
During his testimony he explains that well meaning people like himself went along with Hitler s anti Semitic policies out of a sense of patriotism even though they knew it was wrong
Haywood must weigh considerations of geopolitical expediency and ideals of justice
The trial takes place against the background of the Berlin Blockade and there is pressure to let the German defendants off lightly so as to gain German support in the growing Cold War against the Soviet Union
All four defendants are found guilty and sentenced to life in prison
Haywood visits Janning in his cell
Janning affirms that Haywood s decision was just but asks him to believe that he and the other defendant judges never desired the mass murder of innocents
We never knew he insists that it would come to that
Judge Haywood replies Herr Janning it came to that the first time you sentenced a man to death you knew to be innocent
Haywood departs a title card informs the audience that of 99 defendants sentenced to prison terms in Nuremberg trials that took place in the American Zone none were still serving their sentences as of the film s 1961 release

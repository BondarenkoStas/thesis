The story is set after the end of the Second World War and concerns a British submarine HMS Trojan which is out on a routine exercise to test its new snorkel mast when it encounters a derelict floating magnetic mine left over from the war
The submarine dives but sets off the mine
The mine blows the bows of the submarine off and floods the after section through the displaced snorkel mast killing the 53 crew members in the bow and stern sections
The submarine settles to the bottom leaving twelve crew members alive amidships who have been saved by the watertight doors which had been closed by order of the captain when he realised the imminent danger
When the shore base becomes aware that Trojan is overdue surface rescue vessels are sent out to investigate
The captain of the submarine Lieutenant Commander Peter Armstrong sensibly provides an indication of their position to these vessels by expelling a quantity of oil which rises to the surface
Following standard escape procedure a diver is sent down with an air line while everyone prepares for the rescue
Armstrong selects the first four for release they escape safely without incident and are picked up on the surface
The eight remaining crew assume there are plenty of breathing sets for them all to escape successfully
However the captain discovers that all but four have been destroyed in the blast
This means the final four will have to remain under water until a full salvage operation can be carried out which may take a week or more
Armstrong assembles the others to draw lots through a pack of cards he deals out to decide who goes and who remains
Two the cook A B Higgins and the first lieutenant Lieutenant Manson with the lowest cards select themselves to stay behind along with Armstrong
The top three to go first also select themselves with high cards
Of the other two there is a tie both knaves between Stoker Snipe and E R A
Marks
On losing a re deal young Snipe goes berserk with fear and has to be physically restrained
Armstrong approaches Marks and asks if he will forfeit his place for Snipe sensing difficulties if Snipe is left behind
Marks agrees
They begin to prepare for escape but Snipe now hangs back falsely claiming he has hurt his arm in the scuffle
He insists that Marks should go
Marks and the other three escape safely through the hatch and are picked up by the salvage vessels
Below Manson has a fainting fit but Snipe catches him using both arms without difficulty
Cheerfully at first the four begin the wait for the salvage operation
Above all goes well to begin with in fine weather
Divers manage to secure cables under the submarine which is slowly winched up but only fifteen feet per day can be achieved
However as the days go by the weather turns and soon there is a full storm at sea
As a result the submarine shifts on the cables and sinks again to the floor of the sea
Manson has remained in ill health below nursed with care by Snipe
However chlorine begins to leak from a site next to his bunk
Manson is overcome by the gas and dies
The storm is so bad that the captain of the salvage ship decides his own men are at risk and abandons the salvage operation altogether
The three left in the submarine sense that there is no hope for them
The film ends with Armstrong reading from a naval prayer book
From early scenes in the film and from dialogue throughout the viewer is given insights into the personal and home lives of the crew their hopes and their now thwarted ambitions
For example Snipe is married to a wayward wife whom he idolises whilst Armstrong has been offered a lucrative shore job by his wealthy father in law and had been planning to leave the Navy to take it up as soon as this patrol was over

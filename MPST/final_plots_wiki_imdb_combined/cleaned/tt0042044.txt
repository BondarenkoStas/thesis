Rat and Mole are called to the estate of Toad Hall by Mr McBadger
The owner of Toad Hall J Thadddeus Toad has once again gone off and fallen into another extravagant hobby
This pains McBadger who has been trying to straighten out Toad s financial situation for some time
Toad is currently rampaging across the country in a gypsy cart pulled by a horse name Cyril After much scouring of the countryside Rat and Mole manage to find Toad and get him to stop for a talk
However he refuses to listen to their lecturing and proceeds on his way Not far off Toad lays eyes on a motorcar and he now has found a new mania to become obsessed over motor mania
Hearing his sputtering rantings Rat and Mole manage to get ahold of Toad return him to Toad Hall and lock him in his room hoping that rest will calm him down
However Toad now completely obsessed sneaks out of his residency Shortly thereafter Toad is arrested for supposedly trying to steal a motorcar
At the hearing Toad decides to act as his own attorney
Cyril is called to the stand who explains that after escaping from Toad Hall Toad met up with him and on a journey the next morning they spy a red motorcar which pulls up to a tavern
At the helm of the motor car are a band of weasels who then proceed into place of business
Even given their sordid reputation Toad enters the tavern and talks to the bartender named Mr Winky
Toad quickly makes it known that he wants the motorcar and is willing to pay handsomely
However having no money he decides to trade the deed to Toad Hall for it The prosecuting attorney still doubts this claim and Mr Winky is called to testify
However Winky claims that Toad actually was trying to sell him a stolen motorcar
With this testimony Toad is found guilty
His friends try to plead for a re trial but their requests are denied In prison Toad sorrowfully regrets his foolish acts
As Christmas approaches a visitor is allowed in to see Toad
Claiming to be his Grandmother Cyril infiltrates the jail and gives Toad an old woman s outfit to use to escape
Toad leads the police on chase first by foot and then behind the throttle of a locomotive
Finally abandoning the train Toad makes his way to Rat s residence where McBadger soon joins them
McBadger relays that he saw Toad Hall alight and filled with Weasels
Also in their midst was Mr Winky holding the deed to Toad Hall
This is proof that Winky lied in court and Toad is innocent
However to prove this the group must get the deed back After sneaking in through a secret entrance in Toad Hall the group go through a mad dash to try and retrieve the deed
Finally succeeding Toad s name is cleared and it seems that Toad has reformed finished with his mad mania
However no sooner do his friends toast their good fortune than a resounding crash is heart and Toad is seen outside flying an airplane

In a nameless Baltic country in the 19th Century Kurt Menliff arrives at his seaside castle after many years of wondering through Europe
But he is not warmly received for everyone knows that he is a sadist who gets sexual gratification from whipping his lovers
His former lover is Nevenka Menliff who is now married to Kurt s spineless younger brother Christian
Kurt and Christian s father an invalid Count has never forgiven Kurt for leaving in the first place
The maid Giorgia is anxious to get back at him for causing the suicide of her daughter who stabbed herself in the throat after Kurt walked out on her years ago
Nevertheless Kurt is allowed to stay because he is family The following morning Kurt confronts his other cousin Katia whom he knows to be secretly in love with Christian
He smugly assures her that he feels her pain as he is interested in Nevenka
Katia flees from this unwanted revelation
Kurt next enters the large cavernous living room where his father spends most of the time
Kurt explains that now he has returned home he feels that he deserves to be next in line to inherit the family estate
But the Count assures him that there is no chance of that happening
Everything you were to inherit you forfeited forever he tells Kurt
You did it yourself with your infamy
Angered Kurt storms out of the living room Embittered by this personal defeat Kurt goes to the beach where he sees Nevenka sitting pensively by the water
He approaches her and reminds her their past liaisons
They kiss and then Nevenka recoils striking Kurt across the face wit her riding crop
He then calmly takes it out of her hand and pushes her to the ground
Cracking the riding crop across her back he sneers You haven t changed I see
You ve always loved violence
He then proceeds to strike her again and again
Nevenka s reactions to being beaten are very subdued and the expression her face suggests sexual excitement
After striking her several more times Kurt tosses the riding crop aside and proceeds to rape her After finishing with Nevenka Kurt returns to the castle where he is confronted by Katia and Christian who ask him where Nevenka is to which Kurt replies that he has no idea
They immediately know that Kurt is lying when they see him holding Nevenka s riding crop
As it is getting dark Katia and Christian head out to look for Nevenka as Kurt retires to his bedroom
Soon after he is killed when an unseen person stabs him in the throat with a dagger Meanwhile Christian discovers Nevenka on the beach her back covered with welts
After putting Nevenka to bed Christian sends out for Kurt
The family butler Losat goes to fetch Kurt only to discover his dead body on the floor with the dagger lying beside him
Losat s screams bring the others into the room where Giorgia is hysterical with joy to see him dead killed by the same dagger her daughter used to commit suicide After Kurt s funeral Christian timidly asks his father if he was responsible for the killing
The Count is enraged by these accusations and tells his son to leave the living room
Soon after the entire family unit begins to unravel
The marriage between Christian and Nevenka becomes more strained
Nevenka starts to see visions of Kurt
At one point his ghost visits her in the middle of the night whipping her more ferocious than ever Soon afterwards the Count is found murdered in the living room in the same fashion as Kurt with the same weapon
Christian vows to find the killer and Katia accuses Giorgia pointing out that she had every motive to kill Kurt
Giorgia admits that she wanted to kill Kurt but assures everybody that her love for the Count would have made it impossible for her to kill him
Elsewhere Nevenka s mind becomes more unhinged and each nightmarish vision of Kurt unsettles her ever further
After explaining everything to Christian even he comes to believe that Kurt may have been behind the murder of their father and that his ghost is doing all the killing Christian and Loast unearth Kurt s decaying dead body from the family crypt and burn the remains to try to put Kurt to rest
As they watch Kurt s remains burn the dead man s sinister laughter rings out
Following a cloaked figured dressed as Kurt Christian and Loast follow it to the castle where Christian pulls off the hood to reveals none other than Nevenka
At last the terrible truth comes out Nevenka was the one who murdered Kurt after sneaking back into the castle and sneaking out through hidden passageways
But at her remorse over the crime coupled by the realization that she really did love Kurt compelled her to act out as if he is still alive by dressing in his clothes to complement the illusion
Nevenka even went as far as to whip her self during those nights and murdered her father as revenge for his ostracizing her love Nevenka escapes from her husband stabbing him in the arm in the process and makes her way back to the crypt
Now really believing that Kurt is alive Nevenka decides to put a stop to it all by killing him again
Kurt appears to her for a final time where in their final embrace she stabs him but instead stabs herself in the chest with the dagger and she falls dead

It is the year 1942 in Paris France
The scene opens with a young girl playing with her brother in a bedroom
The two children are laughing and having fun together when several sharp knocks sound on the front door of the apartment
The girl Sarah Starzynski immediately quiets down
Sarah and her mother Madame Starzynski go to the front door and and are greeted by two French policemen
They are able to see Sarah and her mother but they do not see or hear her brother or her father
Sarah says that both her father and her brother have been missing for several days but inside she knows that her brother is in the bedroom Sarah rushes back to the bedroom where her brother is and tells him to hide in a closet despite his protests
The boy reluctantly climbs in after Sarah tells him that it is just like the game that they played before and that she will be back soon
Sarah locks the door then takes the key holding it tightly in her hand
Sarah and her mother are then arrested by the officers
On their way out of the alleyway they bump into Sarah s father M Starzynski
Sarah secretively explains to Rachel that she locked her brother in a closet to avoid having the French police find him and that she must get back to Paris to let him out
The two girls agree to go with each other and escape
They sit in the barrack contemplating the best way to do it The two girls eventually decide to escape during the day
They figure that when the sun is out it will be hot and the guards will be in the shade
Sarah remembers seeing a small ditch under a portion of barbed wire
If they were to escape at night the guards would notice any movement and they have searchlights
Sarah tells Rachel to layer up with as many sweaters as she can
When Rachel questions this logic Sarah explains that the barbed wire around the camp will hurt less when they crawl under it The two girls hatch their plan sneaking out of the barracks in broad daylight
It is swelteringly hot outside
Like they expected all of the guards are in the shade and are avoiding looking in the sun
The two girls run over to the barbed wire in their sweaters
Sarah finds the ditch and lifts the barbed wire over it so that Rachel can escape
When Rachel is about halfway through the wire a large shadow appears from the guard
Both of the girls look up at him
The guard announces that escaping is against the rules
Sarah looks at the guard and quietly says his name Jacques
The officer stunned asks how Sarah knows his name
Sarah remembers when the officer released the apple for her and shortly after heard someone say his name
She is able to break the officer by saying that she will never forget him for what he has done
The officer emotional looks around then lifts up the wire for the two girls to escape The two girls run through a field of grain then into a forest
Rachel realizes that if they are to have any chance of not getting caught they need to remove their yellow stars indicating that they are Jews
As night falls the two girls look desperately for any sign of civilization
Rachel however is getting weak and is not sure if she will be able to make it back to Paris
Suddenly Sarah sees lights coming from a village and begins running towards it
They are roaming the streets when they see a series of military trucks
The girls rush to hide
After that they begin roaming the streets looking for anyone that can help them
They come across a house with the windows open
Sarah shouts trying to gain their attention so that they can help Rachel
The man inside shuns both of the girls and slam the windows shut
The girls find the mans shed and sleep for the night The next morning the man comes to the shed to find the two girls sleeping
He shouts at them to scram but Sarah explains that her friend is gravely ill
The man hesitating looks around and takes both of the girls to the home
Sarah introduces herself under a fake name but Rachel is too ill to speak
The owner of the home Jules Dufaure and his wife Genevieve Dufaure decide to call a physician to examine the girl
The physician arrives with a German officer
While the physician treats Rachel the guard asks if there is another child since there was recently an escape at the camp
Genevieve knowing this might happen had hid Sarah before the officer came
Genevieve and Jules both agree to let the officer inspect the home
As the officer begins his search the doctor comes back announcing that Rachel has died
The officer distracted follows the physician back outside
The two men leave leaving Genevieve Jules and Sarah in the home Days later the Dufaures board a train to take Sarah back to her familys apartment in Paris
The Dufaures not wanting trouble for having one of the escapees dress Sarah in boy s clothes to avoid detection and Jules creates fake identification papers for Sarah
When an officer comes around to check the papers Jules papers are copied well enough to fool the officer and Sarah is allowed to continue
In Paris Sarah rushes into the apartment building and despite the Dufaures calls for her to be cautious Sarah keeps running
She runs up to the third floor knocking furiously on the apartment door
A young boy opens the door and answers Sarah pushes him aside without explanation and finds the closet where she locked her brother
When she unlocks the cupboard she is horrified by what she finds and screams hysterically
The audience presumes that the boy has died After the war Sarah continues to live as a family member with the Dufaures and their two grandsons
When she turns 18 she moves to the United States hoping to put everything that happened behind her
She stops corresponding with the Dufaures when she gets married and has a son William
When her son is nine Sarah still despondent and blaming herself for her brother s death commits suicide by driving her car into the path of an oncoming truck
It s explained to her son that her death was an accident The movie cuts to the present day 2009

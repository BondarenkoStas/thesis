Norah Dain a nightclub disc jockey and aspiring actress living alone in a Manhattan apartment receives a series of obscene phone calls from someone who seems to be watching her on a daily basis
She also finds a decapitated teddy bear in her apartment
At first it is not clear to either the viewer or Norah who is making the calls
A police detective Lt Dave Madden whose own wife was raped and murdered takes a personal interest in Norah and her case
Lt Madden engages in suspicious behavior such as suggesting to Norah several times that he himself could be the caller secretly tape recording his discussions with Norah listening to tapes of Norah and other women talking about obscene phone calls and obsessively studying pornography and the behavior of sex perverts despite the fact that he is exposing his ten year old daughter to such adult concepts and he is being reported to his superiors at work
However midway through the film it is revealed to the audience that the obscene caller is actually Lawrence Sherman a waiter at the nightclub where Norah works
Lawrence lives with and cares for his 19 year old sister Edie who is brain damaged and has the mind of a child
Edie s brain damage is apparently the result of an accident when she was a little girl and saw her older brother Lawrence having sex with an unidentified older woman she ran away in horror or fear and fell down the stairs
Lawrence is unable to have a normal romantic or sexual relationship due to his guilt over the accident and his duty to look after Edie following the death of their parents
He is also frustrated when Edie dresses up in an adult dress high heels and makeup and seems to make advances towards him
He tries to get rid of his frustration by visiting adult bookstores and movies in Times Square but still is obsessed with watching and calling Norah
Despite Lt Madden s warnings that the caller might be someone Norah knows Norah never suspects Lawrence until it is too late
Instead she is friendly to him and even attracted to him complimenting him on his body when they meet at the gym and offering to stay late after work to teach him to dance
Marian Freeman the older experienced manager of the nightclub where Norah works also takes a personal interest in Norah and tries to advise and protect her
She offers to spend the night with Norah at her apartment so Norah won t be alone and afraid
While Marian is visiting Norah receives yet another telephone call and starts to cry
Marian consoles her but Norah senses that Marian is actually making a lesbian pass at her and revolted asks her to leave the apartment immediately
Marian leaves in a huff still wearing Norah s coat which she had been using as a bathrobe
Lawrence who is outside sees Marian leaving in Norah s coat and mistaking her for Norah chases after her and kills her
Lawrence finally attacks Norah after closing time in the empty nightclub and violently rapes her but does not kill her
Lt Madden who has just figured out that Lawrence was watching Norah through the reflection of a mirror arrives too late to save Norah from the rape
He beats Lawrence and then inexplicably lets him leave the club
Lawrence runs through traffic in Times Square imagining that he is running through Central Park towards a welcoming Norah
Police officers chase him and ultimately gun him down as the film ends

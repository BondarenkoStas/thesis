Ghost Dog sees himself as a retainer of Louie a local mobster who saved Ghost Dog s life years ago
While living as a hired hitman for the American Mafia he adheres to the code of the samurai and interprets and applies the wisdom of the Hagakure in his contracts for the mob
Louie tells Ghost Dog to kill a gangster Handsome Frank who is sleeping with the daughter of local mafia don Vargo
Ghost Dog arrives and kills the gangster before seeing that the girl is also in the room at the time she lends him a book he leaves her alive and exits
In order to avoid being implicated in the murder of a made man Vargo and his associate Sonny Valerio decide to get rid of Ghost Dog
Louie knows practically nothing about Ghost Dog and the hitman communicates only by homing pigeon
The mobsters start by tracing all the pigeon coops in town
They find Ghost Dog s cabin atop a building and kill his pigeons
Ghost Dog realizes he must kill the entire mafia or otherwise they will kill him and his master
During the day Ghost Dog frequently visits the park to see his best friend a Haitian ice cream salesman named Raymond who speaks only French
Ghost Dog does not understand French and Raymond does not understand English but the two seem to understand each other
Ghost Dog also makes friends with a little girl named Pearline to whom he lends the book Rashōmon and Other Stories he received from Vargo s daughter
Paralleling a major theme of Rashōmon Louie and Ghost Dog have different accounts of the circumstances of their meeting in Louie s flashback he shoots Ghost Dog s attacker in self defense while in Ghost Dog s flashback Louie shoots the attacker just as the attacker is about to kill Ghost Dog
Eventually Ghost Dog attacks Vargo s mansion single handedly and kills almost everyone he encounters sparing only Louie and Vargo s daughter
At night Ghost Dog kills Sonny Valerio in his house shooting a bullet through Valerio s bathroom pipe
Ghost Dog is later expecting that Louie attacks him
He goes to the park and gives Raymond all his money helping him to stay in the country and build a boat
Pearline appears and gives back Rashōmon to Ghost Dog expressing that she liked it
Ghost Dog then gives Pearline his copy of Hagakure and encourages her to read it
Though Louie feels some loyalty to Ghost Dog he finally confronts Ghost Dog at Raymond s ice cream stand with Raymond and Pearline watching
Ghost Dog is unwilling to attack his master and allows Louie to kill him
His last act is to give Louie the copy of Rashōmon and encourage him to read it
It is then revealed that Vargo s daughter ordered Louie to murder Ghost Dog
Pearline takes Ghost Dog s gun and shoots at Louie but the gun is empty
Ghost Dog dies peacefully with Raymond and Pearline at his side
Later Pearline reads passionately the Hagakure indicating that she may follow Ghost Dog s way in the future

Frost is transferred to a local safe house maintained by housekeeper Matt Weston a young agent on his first low level CIA posting
The CIA sends in a team led by veteran agent Daniel Kiefer to interrogate Frost and bring him back to the US
Weston watches uneasily as Kiefer and his men waterboard Frost
When the power to the safe house is cut the CIA team realize that they are in grave danger

The device contains Israeli intelligence which contain details of corrupt officials and secret money transfers involving American CIA British MI6 and other intelligence agencies Weston recognizes the reference to the Mossad because the CIA accused Frost of selling secrets to them before he became a rogue agent
Weston s own superiors may be implicated

In London a serial killer is raping women and strangling them with neckties
Most of the film takes place in Covent Garden which at the time was still the location of the city s wholesale fruit and vegetable market
Fairly early in the film the audience sees that fruit merchant Robert Rusk is in fact the murderer
However circumstantial evidence has already built up around his friend Richard Blaney
Blaney s ex wife Brenda runs a matchmaking service that Rusk used until he was blacklisted for beating up his dates
One day Rusk shows up at her office and tries to seduce her when she spurns his advances he rapes and strangles her in a fit of rage
Suspicion falls on Blaney who is previously seen threatening his ex wife in public as well as being seen leaving her building shortly after her murder
The subsequent murder of Blaney s girlfriend Barbara Babs Milligan occurs off screen the audience sees her entering Rusk s apartment with him but the camera then pulls back down the stairs all the way out to the other side of the street
The audience next sees Rusk at night carrying a large sack and lifting it into the back of a lorry among sacks of unsold potatoes bound for Lincolnshire
Rusk soon finds that his distinctive jeweled tie pin is missing and realises that Babs must have torn it off as he was murdering her
He climbs into the back of the lorry but it starts off on its journey north
The killer desperately scrabbles through the sack of potatoes to find the dead woman s hand
Rigor mortis has set in and he has to break her fingers in order to prise the pin from her grasp
Owing to fake evidence set up by Rusk Blaney is gaoled while protesting his innocence
Chief Inspector Oxford the detective investigating the murders reconsiders the previous events and begins to believe that he has arrested the wrong man
He discusses the case with his wife in several scenes of comic relief concerning her pretensions as a gourmet cook
With the help of his fellow inmates Blaney escapes from prison
Oxford knows he will head to Rusk s flat for revenge and immediately goes there
Blaney arrives first to find that the door to the flat is unlocked
He creeps in and sees what appears to be Rusk asleep in bed and strikes the body three times with a tyre iron
However the body is in fact the corpse of another of Rusk s female victims strangled by a necktie
Oxford bursts through the door
Blaney is still standing by the corpse holding the tyre iron and begins to protest his innocence but then they both hear something or someone banging heavily coming up the staircase
The two men wait in the flat and witness Rusk dragging a large trunk inside to cart away the body only to come face to face with two determined witnesses
The film ends with Oxford s urbane but pointed comment Mr Rusk you re not wearing your tie
Rusk drops the trunk in defeat

In Kino s Journey the protagonist Kino accompanied by a talking motorcycle named Hermes travels through a mystical world of many different countries and forests each unique in its customs and people
She only spends three days and two nights in every town without exception on the principle that three days is enough time to learn almost everything important about a place while leaving time to explore new lands
Kino says in The Land of Visible Pain that this principle is probably a lie specifically noting if I stay any longer I m afraid I will settle down
The recurring theme of the anime and novels is described by the phrase The world is not beautiful therefore it is beautiful
Kino s Journey explores what the anime director Ryūtarō Nakamura described as a radical sense of beauty and brutality loneliness nonsense oppression and tragedy are often juxtaposed against compassion and a fairy tale atmosphere
For protection and hunting Kino carries a 44 single action revolver that uses liquid explosives in place of gunpowder and a 22 automatic pistol
Later in Kino s adventures in the novels Kino also uses a pump action shotgun and a semi automatic sniper rifle along with a variety of other tools including knives
In the anime Kino is shown to carry no fewer than five knives including one which can fire 22 bullets from its hilt
Kino is an unusually quick draw and practices every day before dawn
Technology in this world exists sometimes to the level of science fiction although anachronisms are common
The level of technology also varies from country to country

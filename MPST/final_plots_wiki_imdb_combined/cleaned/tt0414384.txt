The predator then sets off his ship s self destruct sequence but this fails to kill him as he is outside the range of the explosion
Shamed by defeat and having exposed his race to the humans the Predator is exiled by his clan to a planet inhabited by deadly alien creatures
One hundred years later the Predator now called Scarface is offered a chance for redemption
The Predator technology derived from Scarface s abandoned equipment has proliferated into the hands of Bruno s descendants and warring gangs who have utilized it in New Way City now known as Neonopolis City of Light as well as against other Predators

Lucretia sends a group of mechanically enhanced Russian Mercenaries known as the Machine Men led by Viktor the Chechen to New Way Field to deal with Scarface
However the four mercenaries are butchered by the Predator who takes Viktor s head
Lucretia is shocked when El Hongo later calls her to tell her the Machine Men have been killed and she sends El Hongo to a high security black market trading depot at the docks which is protected by Borgia Black Ops disguised as Ex Porn Star Hookers led by Baby Blew

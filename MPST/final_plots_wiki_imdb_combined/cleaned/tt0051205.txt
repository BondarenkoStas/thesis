The title and credits are shown over a painting of a jungle at dusk
We open with a view of the Thames River
A man enters the Explorers Club
In a comfortable club room Dr James Moran is discussing an interesting tale recounted by a deceased colleague by the name of Ashby
Dr Patterson and Lewis Carling listen with some skepticism
Moran tells them he was made aware of a tribe in the Amazon that can bring the dead back to life
He has a map and he intends to go see for himself
He asks Carling if he wants to join him
Carling thinks the departure date is too soon
Moran is called from the room
Dr Patterson warns Carling that while brilliant Moran is very strange and insanity runs in his family
Ultimately Carling joins Moran and they fly to the Amazon
Hacking through the jungle they spot a mountain noted on Ashby s map
The tribe they seek is related to the Inca
A native ritual is underway when they encounter the tribe
A man and a woman stand on a raised platform
The snake handling witch doctor presides
The native girl appears to be drugged swaying to the beat of the drums
Carling is overwhelmed by the ceremony and shouts at the natives
He is killed with a spear
The native girl is led to a large plant the womaneater which waves its many arms
She sees the plant and screams as she is pulled towards it
The next day Moran is stricken with jungle fever
He is taken away on a stretcher with very little chance of survival ENGLAND
Five Years Later
A car pulls up to a large country home
Moran survived and is doing research in his study
He unlocks the door to and enters a well equipped basement lab
A native man Tanga plays a drum with a jungle beat
He leads a woman Susan Curtis towards the same plant we saw five years earlier
The woman is pushed into the plant
Moran notes She ll become part of the plant
And from it I ll get the serum to bring the dead back to life
She won t have died in vain
Tanga burns her clothes in the furnace as Moran checks on his formula
He injects the formula into an eggplant shaped object which begins to pulsate
A few minutes later it stops the formula is a failure Sergeant Bolton pays a call on Moran
He tells Moran he is making inquires about the disappearance of Susan Curtis
Moran lies and denies any knowledge
He asks his housekeeper Mrs Margaret Santor if she s seen the girl
Mrs Santor sees the policeman out At a carnival we meet Sally Norton helping a barker Bristow the carnival owner draw customers
She performs a hula dance to entice the crowd
During a break she meets Jack Venner and agrees to meet him the next day at his garage
Sally was fired because of a fight the night before between Venner and Sally s boss
Venner takes Sally to see Dr Moran for a job
Sally goes to the door and Tanga greets her
She is shown into the study by Tanga
Moran initially tells her he has no job at the moment but changes his mind
He asks her Would you be prepared to live in
She agrees but later tells Venner He s rather a strange person though had a funny look in his eye
Sally grabs her bag and walks up to the house to start her new job
Over Margaret s strong objection Moran has engaged Sally to help with the housework
Moran warns Margaret Be nice to her
The police are still investigating the Susan Curtis disappearance
They suspect it may now be murder
They agree that Moran s property needs to be searched
They return to see Moran again
Inspector Brownlow and Bolton are invited in by Sally
Brownlow asks Morans permission to search the grounds
Of course they find nothing
Tanga and Moran draw a beaker of plant sap from the womaneater
Moran is convinced he can improve on the formula to restore life It is too dangerous for Moran to recruit local victims so he goes to the city
In London Moran walks the city streets at night
He follows a woman Judy into a private club
The woman has joined a man at a table for a drink
When the boyfriend becomes angry and walks out Moran moves in
He pays for her drink and offers her a cigarette
Judy goes off with Moran
Moran takes Judy home and down into the basement lab
Tanga seizes her and prepares her for the plant
Moran returns to his study and is confronted by a suspicious Margaret
Five years before Moran and Margaret had a spark for each other but Moran is no longer interested in Margaret
I believe you re doing something wicked Margaret tells Moran
He threatens to send her away
Cowed by the threat Margaret backs down and returns to her room
Judy is now drugged and prepared for the plant
Tanga plays the drums and then leads Judy to the womaneater
It stands about seven feet tall and has half a dozen branches like arms drawing its victim towards the mouths The next day Sally visits Jack Venner at his garage
Jack blurts out Sally how about us getting married
She thinks it s a crazy idea as they ve only known each other for two weeks
Sally returns to the house late and Mrs Santor voices her objections to Moran but she is overruled
Moran tells Sally he is sending Mrs Santor away and she is to replace her
Sally is reluctant to accept the promotion and tells Moran so
Like Margaret Sally is suspicious
Moran and Tanga draw off another beaker of plant sap
Sally leaves the house and returns to Jack s garage
She tells Jack Oh Jack I ve got to leave that place
I can t stay there
Jack gives her a drink
He tells her not to return but she tells him she will spend the night and pack and leave the next morning
Margaret admits she s still in love with Moran but he does not reciprocate
Margaret gets angry at being jilted for a younger woman
She pulls a ceremonial knife off Moran s desk and tries to stab him
He manages to disarm Margaret and chokes her to death The next morning Sally brings Moran tea
She tells him she won t accept the job
Moran tells Sally she can leave anytime she wishes
Sally returns to her room and packs her clothes
Before she can walk out the front door Moran uses the final salary ruse to draw her into his study
When pressed for an explanation for refusing the job Sally tells Moran she s going to marry Jack Venner
Moran expresses his love for Sally
He takes her down into the lab At police headquarters Brownlow gets a telephone call that relates to Moran and the plant
Evidence of a girl s clothes was found close to the Moran house
Venner is waiting at the garage Sally is overdue
He calls the Moran house but gets no answer
Venner drives over to the Moran house
He knocks on the door
Moran answers
He tells Venner that Sally left this morning
Venner tells Moran he thinks Sally is still in the house and he demands to see her
Venner leaves and vows to go straight to the police and report his suspicions
Moran returns to the lab and unlocks the door Sally is behind
He takes her to see the plant
She asks What is it
Moran answers It s the great juju of Tanga s tribe
Its their idol
They worship it
Tanga begins playing the drums to the rhythmic movement of the plant s arms
Venner stops at the police station to see Sgt
Bolton
He is told Bolton is out investigating a missing person out by the Moran house Sally watches as Moran injects his formula into a body on a gurney
The body begins breathing and the pulsometer responds
Margaret sits up and the sheet covering her face falls away
Moran calls to Margaret but she does not speak
Moran concludes that the body is revived by the formula but not the mind
Moran accuses Tanga Your people cheated me
They gave me only half the secret
Our secrets are not for you Tanga replies
Margaret mimicking the plant reaches out and pulls her arms back while she walks towards Sally
Sally screams
Margaret s head snaps back and she falls to the floor
Margaret is once again dead
The police arrive and pound on Moran s door
Venner forces a window and they enter the house
Tanga leads Sally towards the plant
She resists but Tanga picks her up in his arms and carries her to the plant
Moran seeing Sally as the next victim of the plant attacks and struggles with Tanga
While the police search the house Venner finds the basement lab and takes Sally out as Tanga and Moran struggle
Moran manages to knock the younger man out
He tells Tanga You ve cheated me
Now I ll destroy your Idol as you ve destroyed me
Moran throws a flammable liquid on the plant
It bursts into flames
Moran tries to exit the lab but Tanga awakens and hits him with a knife in his back
We close with Tanga falling to his knees before the burning womaneater plant

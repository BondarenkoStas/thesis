Gabriel Oak is a young shepherd
With the savings of a frugal life and a loan he has leased and stocked a sheep farm
He falls in love with a newcomer six years his junior Bathsheba Everdene a proud beauty who arrives to live with her aunt Mrs Hurst
Over time Bathsheba and Gabriel grow to like each other well enough and Bathsheba even saves his life once
However when he makes her an unadorned offer of marriage she refuses she values her independence too much and him too little
Feeling betrayed and embarrassed Gabriel offers blunt protestations that only foster her haughtiness
After a few days she moves to Weatherbury a village some miles off
When next they meet their circumstances have changed drastically
An inexperienced new sheepdog drives Gabriel s flock over a cliff ruining him
After selling off everything of value he manages to settle all his debts but emerges penniless
He seeks employment at a hiring fair in the town of Casterbridge
When he finds none he heads to another such fair in Shottsford a town about ten miles from Weatherbury
On the way he happens upon a dangerous fire on a farm and leads the bystanders in putting it out
When the veiled owner comes to thank him he asks if she needs a shepherd
She uncovers her face and reveals herself to be none other than Bathsheba
She has recently inherited her uncle s estate and is now wealthy
Though somewhat uncomfortable she employs him
Bathsheba s valentine to Boldwood Meanwhile Bathsheba has a new admirer the lonely and repressed William Boldwood
Boldwood is a prosperous farmer of about forty whose ardour Bathsheba unwittingly awakens when her curiosity piqued because he has never bestowed on her the customary admiring glance she playfully sends him a valentine sealed with red wax on which she has embossed the words Marry me
Boldwood not realising the valentine was a jest becomes obsessed with Bathsheba and soon proposes marriage
Although she does not love him she toys with the idea of accepting his offer he is after all the most eligible bachelor in the district
However she postpones giving him a definite answer
When Gabriel rebukes her for her thoughtlessness regarding Boldwood she fires him
When Bathsheba s sheep begin dying from bloat she discovers to her chagrin that Gabriel is the only man who knows how to cure them
Her pride delays the inevitable but finally she is forced to beg him for help
Afterwards she offers him back his job and their friendship is restored
Sergeant Troy returns At this point the dashing Sergeant Francis Frank Troy returns to his native Weatherbury and by chance encounters Bathsheba one night
Her initial dislike turns to infatuation after he excites her with a private display of swordsmanship
Gabriel observes Bathsheba s interest in the young soldier and tries to discourage it telling her she would be better off marrying Boldwood
Boldwood becomes aggressive towards Troy and Bathsheba goes to Bath to prevent Troy returning to Weatherbury as she fears Troy may be harmed on meeting Boldwood
On their return Boldwood offers his rival a large bribe to give up Bathsheba
Troy pretends to consider the offer then scornfully announces they are already married
Boldwood withdraws humiliated and vows revenge
Bathsheba soon discovers that her new husband is an improvident gambler with little interest in farming
Worse she begins to suspect he does not love her
In fact Troy s heart belongs to her former servant Fanny Robin
Before meeting Bathsheba Troy had promised to marry Fanny on the wedding day however the luckless girl went to the wrong church
She explained her mistake but Troy humiliated at being left at the altar angrily called off the wedding
When they parted unbeknownst to Troy Fanny was pregnant with his child
Fanny Robin Some months later Troy and Bathsheba encounter Fanny on the road destitute as she painfully makes her way toward the Casterbridge workhouse
Troy sends his wife onward with the horse and gig before she can recognise the girl then gives Fanny all the money in his pocket telling her he will give her more in a few days
Fanny uses up the last of her strength to reach her destination
A few hours later she dies in childbirth along with the baby
Mother and child are then placed in a coffin and sent home to Weatherbury for interment
Gabriel who has long known of Troy s relationship with Fanny tries to conceal the child s existence but Bathsheba agrees that the coffin can be left in her house overnight from her sense of duty towards a former servant of the household
Her new servant Liddy repeats the rumour that Fanny had a child when all the servants are in bed Bathsheba unscrews the lid and sees the two bodies inside
Troy then comes home from Casterbridge where he had gone to keep his appointment with Fanny
Seeing the reason for her failure to meet him he gently kisses the corpse and tells the anguished Bathsheba This woman is more to me dead as she is than ever you were or are or can be
The next day he spends all his money on a marble tombstone with the inscription Erected by Francis Troy in beloved memory of Fanny Robin Then loathing himself and unable to bear Bathsheba s company he leaves
After a long walk he bathes in the sea leaving his clothes on the beach
A strong current carries him away but he is rescued by a rowing boat
Climax A year later with Troy presumed drowned Boldwood renews his suit
Burdened with guilt over the pain she has caused him Bathsheba reluctantly consents to marry him in six years long enough to have Troy declared dead
Troy however is not dead
When he learns that Boldwood is again courting Bathsheba he returns to Weatherbury on Christmas Eve to claim his wife
He goes to Boldwood s house where a party is under way and orders Bathsheba to come with him when she shrinks back in surprise he seizes her arm and she screams
At this Boldwood shoots Troy dead and tries unsuccessfully to turn the gun on himself
Although Boldwood is condemned to hang for murder his friends petition the Home Secretary for mercy citing insanity
This is granted and Boldwood s sentence is changed to confinement during Her Majesty s pleasure
Bathsheba profoundly chastened by guilt and grief buries her husband in the same grave as Fanny and the child and adds a suitable inscription
Ending Throughout her tribulations Bathsheba comes to rely increasingly on her oldest and as she admits to herself only real friend Gabriel
When he gives notice that he is leaving her employ she realises how important he has become to her well being
That night she goes alone to visit him in his cottage to find out why he is deserting her
Pressed he reluctantly reveals that it is because people have been injuring her good name by gossiping that he wants to marry her
She exclaims that it is too absurd too soon to think of by far
He bitterly agrees that it is absurd but when she corrects him saying that it is only too soon he is emboldened to ask once again for her hand in marriage
She accepts and the two are quietly wed

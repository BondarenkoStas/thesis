The special begins with a musical number showing that Beansboro Elementary School is canceled for the day due to a seven inch snowfall
While the adults incessantly complain about the problems snow and ice cause the children enjoy the opportunity to play outside
The scene then shifts to Holly DeCarlo a lonely young girl and aspiring magician with only one friend a tone deaf somewhat geeky character named Charles who has a knack for climatology
While practicing a magic act with Charles the wind blows Holly s hat off her head out the window and onto a snowman who comes to life as Frosty thus revealing that Holly s hat was that old silk hat featured in the original song and previous adaptations
Meanwhile a new product appears in Beansboro that successfully causes snow to instantly disappear an aerosol spray called Summer Wheeze
Summer Wheeze s inventor Mr Twitchell hopes to use the product to win over the people of Beansboro so that he will be crowned King of the Beansboro Winter Carnival apparently believing that the title will give him actual dominion over the townspeople
At a presentation before the town council one of the trustees voices concern about the environmental impact of the untested product to which Mr Twitchell responds by opening a trapdoor beneath her seat
To Twitchell s delight and Frosty s dismay the town of Beansboro falls head over heels for Summer Wheeze causing Frosty to fear for his long term safety
When many of their classmates rally for the elimination of snow when in class the next day only a day after singing about its virtues Holly and Charles take on the duties of protecting Frosty including hiding him in a freezer and securing refuge for him in an ice castle built for the Carnival
Later Holly gets Frosty to appear at the Winter Carnival in an attempt to persuade the townspeople to rethink their hatred of snow
Singing about the joy of winter Frosty is unanimously declared king of the carnival
In the end Frosty and Holly make amends with Mr Twitchell let him wear the crown and cape and let him ride in the sled of the carnival king
Later Frosty must leave Beansboro but he assures Holly that he will be back again someday

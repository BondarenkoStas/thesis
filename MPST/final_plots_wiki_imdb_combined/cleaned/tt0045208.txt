Daffy Duck is Duck Drake a Private Eye Ear Nose and Throat
He receives a call that summons him to the J Cleaver Axe Handle Estate where somebody supposedly has been murdered
He arrives at the house and suspects a shapely female duck with red hair and a curve hugging red dress of committing the crime
The woman referred to as The Body shows him affection saying Rowr
Rowr
Oh baby
gorgeous hunk of duck and showers him with kisses
However Drake is only interested in inquiring about the murder
Drake immediately accuses her of hating the deceased and drawing her little pistol out of her bag pointing it at him and slowly squeezing the trigger tighter and tighter and tighter until six rounds plug Drake right in the face
At first the bullets appear to have decapitated him until his head sticks out from his jacket with his beak full of holes and proclaims loudly Not so TIGHT
He then elaborates how The Body grabbed the deer rifle off the wall prompting the man to run screaming from the room then letting him have it when he tries to sneak out
Drake is shot multiple times while mimicking a game dummy so that the scoreboard goes from 5 to 200 before eventually saying Pretty good shooting sister
The woman insists that he searches her and kisses him on the lips two more times
Amazingly the target is still alive and kicking so the next scene involves her crushing him with a grand piano suspended from the ceiling
Drake predictably ends up on the receiving end of this reenactment after startling the woman into releasing the rope holding up the piano which falls and crushes him through the floor leaving him with piano keys for teeth
Even though the victim has been shot twice and squished by a piano he is still defiantly clinging on to life with the love struck duck getting another chance to kiss him on the cheek
This results in a last desperate attempt to kill him by moving nearby train tracks to the front door because the victim always watched the 5 15 express go past every day
At that precise time Drake opens the door and is flattened by the oncoming train leaving him with a lantern on his head
After insulting the driver he makes the shocking discovery that he is in the wrong house
Silly boy
The ax handle estate is a couple of blocks up the street The Body tells him
Finally accepting that the seductress is innocent he is further stunned when she claims being guilty Of being crazy about you sweatheart
Drake having ignored her advances throughout the entire episode notices the old ball and chain look in her eye and flees
He runs right through the front door
Not giving up on her cutie pie The Body hikes up her skirt and chases after him also breaking through the front door which now houses their bride and groom imprints

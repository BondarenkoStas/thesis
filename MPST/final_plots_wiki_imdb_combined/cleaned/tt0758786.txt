Thomas Bardo has been down on his luck ever since the company he worked for had closed
He has been without a job his unemployment had run out and he seems to be lost in the system as he tries finding a new job
He is forced out of his ghetto apartment by a heartless landlord and he takes the small lot of possessions and heads for a public park bench to spend the night Brandi Boski is an attractive young female she is a nurses aide at a retirement home who seems to be very caring for the residents there
At night when work is out Brandi likes to party and the company she keeps is shady to say the least
She scores some ecstasy at a bar one night and then makes plans to go back to her house and sleep with her drug dealer As Brandi is on her way home she is talking on her cell to her boyfriend drug dealer Rashid
At the same time a policeman rudely awakes Thomas and tells him to head for the shelter across town because its illegal to be in the park after dusk
As Thomas makes his way across town Brandi who isn t paying attention to the road hits Thomas with her car with great force
Thomas is now literally stuck half way through her front windshield with his legs hanging out of the window on the hood of the car Brandi is freaked out and confused about what to do
She tries dropping him off at a hospital but the idea of getting caught scares her off to hide her car with Thomas stuck in her windshield in her garage
When she learns that he is still alive she promises to get him help
Since she is still high on drugs and alcohol she instead goes into her house and makes love to her drug dealer Rashid
She drags Rashid into this whole fiasco the next day as she figures he has done this sort of thing before as far as getting rid of bodies Rashid finds it hard to do the deed and instead is betsed by Thomas who had hid a bic pen in his sleeve and revealed it at the right time right through Rashid s eye
Then he took Rashid s gun and shot him
Brandi comes out of her house and sees Thomas escaping and smashes him in the head with a hammer
She drags him into the garage and decides to spill gasoline all over the car Thomas and Rashid
Thomas somehow bests her and she burns alive in her own garage

On a tip from an informant they venture into a building where Washington is presumed to be hiding
Washington preemptively fires a submachine gun through his front door seriously wounding Casey
Backup arrives to swarm the building but Washington executes a cunning escape in an NYPD squad car after murdering two police officers while another officer is killed by friendly fire
In a surprising move after the suspect s lawyer Sam Vigoda brings him in district attorney Morganstern appoints Sean Casey a newly graduated assistant district attorney and Liam Casey s son to prosecute Washington
Passing over the more experienced executive assistant Elihu Harrison Morganstern deliberately picks Casey due to Harrison s expected opposition in the upcoming election for District Attorney
During the trial Vigoda does not dispute his client s guilt but postulates that the police were specifically looking to murder Washington
The defendant corroborates this theory by revealing that he had been bribing certain officers including one called Kurt Kleinhoff in return for protection while dealing drugs
Vigoda theorizes that when a rival dealer named Carlos Alvarez offered the officers more money Washington refused to match it thus becoming a target
Although inexperienced Casey mounts a strong argument questioning Washington s credibility and his father provides effective testimony
Casey wins the case as Washington is sentenced to consecutive life terms without parole
At the celebration after the win an associate from Vigoda s legal team Peggy Lindstrom begins an affair with Casey
After Morganstern is incapacitated by a heart attack Casey is persuaded by the mayor to run for DA
He wins the election
Meanwhile Kleinhoff s decomposed body is discovered floating near a maritime dock
An address book found at the scene contains the names of several cops from precincts who responded to the Washington shooting
After several interrogations a number of officers confess about their entanglement in the bribery and narcotics scandal
Allegretto admits he initially lied about his involvement he accepted bribes while also plotting to murder Washington with the other corrupt officers killing the third dead officer instead
Berated as scum by Casey for his conduct and unwilling to face jail a depressed Allegretto commits suicide
Liam discloses to his son Sean that he and Allegretto were not legally authorized to arrest Washington due to an expired search warrant
Liam concedes that he forged a judge s signature with a new warrant
Following an admission of guilt by Liam about the forgery in a private consultation with Judge Dominick Impelliteri the judge decides to fill out a new warrant and purposely obviates the technicality
He also suggests to Sean that he destroy the invalid warrant
The film ends with Casey giving the introductory lecture for a new class of assistant district attorneys urging them to approach their job with diligence

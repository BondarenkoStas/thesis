The story revolves around two Prefecture of Police officers LÃ©o Vrinks head of the BRI and Denis Klein head of the BRB
Both want to catch a vicious gang of armoured car robbers that have killed nine people
But when their immediate superior the chief of the criminal police announces that he will soon retire the rivalry pushes Klein to play dirty in order to get the promotion
Vrinks is a good investigative detective with a loyal cadre of detectives and officers as well as a stable of unsavory informants he has cultivated over the years
Klein who has questionable ethics is not so accomplished
Vrinks also helps people in particular a bar tender who was raped and beaten by a criminal Bruno who was robbing the bistro where she was employed
Vrinks and his team kidnap Bruno and drive him out to a forest for punishment
The gangster is stripped naked given a mock execution pushed into open grave and warned to never molest that woman again
Unfortunately Vrinks methods catch up with him when he is tricked by Silien an incarcerated informant on day release to be his getaway driver in the murder of Silien s gangster colleagues whose testimony had sent Silien to prison
However the murdered guy was too one of Klein s informants so Silien in a quid pro quo exchange of Vrinks s alibi and silence reveals the detective where the armoured car gang are hiding in an industrial suburb
Vrinks and his team stake out the factory with Klein s team acting as backup but after patient surveillance when on the verge of catching the robbers Klein ignores procedure and drunkenly comes out of hiding
The gang alerted thereby spark a firefight which results in the death of Vrinks best friend and taking hostage a young detective woman
An internal investigation is launched into the botched operation but Klein avoids censure for his behaviour when finding a prostitute and illegal immigrant who witnessed Silien s murder and saw Vrinks who drove him out of the scene
Vrinks is arrested and thrown into jail for his role by a cop hating judge whereas Klein is exonerated by the police inquiry of the failed gang arrest because Vrinks evidence is ruled inadmissible to incriminate him
While awaiting his indictment proceeding Vrinks manage to disarm his guards just to obtain a free short face to face meeting with Camille in the Court s corridor
Later Camille is contacted by Silien and they agree to meet but their phone call is tapped by Klein s team who follow her to the meeting our of town
Silien gets into her car gives her some money to keep on whereas Klein s people move in and a car chase is on whereby Camille s car is forced off the road
It ends by her car crushing and the killing of both her and Silien which enables Klein to clear his name again
He uses Silien s gun to first shoot the already dead Camille then use his own gun to shoot at Silien body
It now looks like the informant shot Camille in the car causing them to veer off the road and Klein shot Silien in self defence
Seven years later Vrinks is released from prison for just his silence in Silien s killings
Klein who has become chief of the Paris criminal police kept people silent by handing out promotions or by forcing others to retire or transfer
Vrinks then has an emotional reunion with his now grown up daughter telling her that he is going far away but first he has to take care of unfinished business
Vrinks goes to see Titi an old colleague who quit the police and works at a club where he was recently threatened by men who were ejected out and seemed strangely familiar namely the friends of Bruno the rapist whom Vrink s people abandoned naked in the forest
Vrinks gets a gun from Titi planning to take revenge on Klein who is attending the annual Parisian police ball
Using a stolen police ID Vrinks gets into the venue and confronts Klein in the lavatory
Meanwhile the men who were ejected from the club follow Vrinks to the soiree and wait ominously outside
Klein explains that Camille was already dead when he shot her and Vrinks realises what a sad man Klein has become and suggests he kill himself with the gun that he brought
After Vrinks leaves Klein follows him into the street shouting obscenities and blaming Vrinks for Camille s death
Afterwards Bruno shows up on a motorcycle and shoots Klein in the head
It is then revealed that Titi said to his attackers at the bar Klein s name instead of Vrinks s name
Vrinks meets his daughter at the airport
The film ends with them queuing at the airport security check on their way for a new life abroad

Young archaeologist Dr Valerie Cammon and her colleague Dr Kim go by ship to a volcanic island in the Mediterranean sea
While she seeks relics in a cave a seaquake sinks their ship without survivors
At about the same time all archaeologists except for Dr Cammon get eaten by the re awakened ancient Lernaean Hydra
During the tempest a whole island disappears
Two months later Vincent and Dixie Camden intended to organize a man hunt for cranky millionaires
Their Captain unaware of the Hydra suggests the nearby aforementioned island as a substitute
Four ex convicts Tim Nolan George Stults Gwen Russell Bob Crick and Ronnie Kaplan are marooned at the shore and given 24 hours headstart
The following day the rich hunters arrive but attract the Hydra s attention and get eaten
The same fate befalls some of the fugitives
Dr Cammon runs into the surviving fugitives and helps Tim to find the magic sword of Hercules
As Dr Cammon tries to distract the Hydra Tim gets the sword so he can now fight the beast but sadly he retrieves the sword too late and Dr Cammon is torn apart and eaten by the Hydra
Tim manages to cut off its heads for good but fails to cut the last head completely off
With Dr Cammon dead the remaining fugitives are forced to go on without her help
Eventually the only ones left are Tim and Gwen and they return to the ship not knowing that the Hydra has recovered and is following them
Now only one headed it can move like a snake and makes its way into the belly of the ship
Gwen wants to use the radio for calling SOS but the microphone is damaged
Mr Camden blindsides her and blackmails Tim
The Hydra kills Camden from behind then devours Dixie
Tim grabs the magic sword again and this time he really kills the monster
Tim and Gwen reach Sardinia and use the 10 000 000

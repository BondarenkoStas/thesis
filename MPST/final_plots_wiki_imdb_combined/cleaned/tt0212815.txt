In June 2000 Henry Hart a gay successful artist living in New York receives a call from his old friend Grace Cornwell a kindergarten teacher in his hometown who tells him that his grandfather Sam suffered a stroke
Although his assistant Mary Bishop wants him to stay Henry feels himself bound to visit and help his ailing grandfather
He jumps on the next plane to his hometown Big Eden Montana giving up his new home and career
Stranded in his place of birth Henry is confronted by the changes of time
Though Sam is becoming better Henry has the feeling that he should stay with his helpless grandfather because he himself fears becoming an orphan
While accompanying Sam to church every Sunday he involuntarily becomes part of the town life and gossip again
The town folks somehow always knew about his sexuality but never mentioned it publicly
Further complicating the situation is the presence of his former high school crush Dean Stewart who moved back in town a week earlier
Dean has just split up with from his wife and has returned to Big Eden with his kids Ben and Andrew
This leaves Henry trying to work out his unresolved feelings for Dean
Grace set up a support system for both Henry and Sam
Included is widow Thayer and Pike Dexter a very shy Native American
Pike is the town s general store owner and the Widow Thayer is center of gossip and society in Big Eden
She attempts several times to hook up Henry with different people first women but after a few social gatherings she realizes her error and invites men instead
While all this is going on the Widow Thayer cooks for grandfather and grandson daily and Pike takes it over to their house and helps setting the table
After a few weeks Pike realizes that the food is inappropriate and learns how to cook healthy dishes
He keeps this secret telling neither the Harts nor Thayer exchanging Thayer s dinner with his own delicious meals
He also orders the special supplies Henry needs so he can continue painting up in Big Eden
Pike who wants to have things nice for Henry has obviously fallen in love with him too
Meanwhile Dean is around Henry a lot helping him build a ramp for Sam s wheelchair and taking Henry dancing and to the mountains
With all of his efforts he tries to show Henry his affection and feelings but Dean eventually tells Henry that he couldn t live together with him
Time passes and Sam becomes worse
One night Henry arrives at home and finds Sam dead in his bedroom
The town falls into mourning at Sam s death
He built every house in town and was closely connected to each and every one
Though Dean comforts Henry Pike does the opposite by secluding himself
A funeral is held for Sam where everyone shows up except for Pike
Henry now completely alone realizes that Pike meant something to him
Pike had shared a promised dinner together with him one night where he fascinated Henry by his knowledge of stars and mystical stories
That upsets Henry even more because he thought Sam meant something to Pike too
They both don t talk until the day Henry is leaving for New York
In the very last minute Pike accepts his love for Henry and tries to catch him at the airport but he is too late
On his way home Pike sees Sam s truck in front of his store not expecting Henry to be waiting for him

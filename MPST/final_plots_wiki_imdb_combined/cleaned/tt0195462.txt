Chandler Smythe is murdered on his 35th birthday
He is then recruited as an agent of the Corps and becomes a partner to Henry McNeil
Henry was killed in the 1970s and still dresses like Shaft
The Corps best described as God s police force on Earth has the mission of locating citizens who have made a Faustian style bargain with the agents of evil
When the Corps find a lost soul they must decide whether to rehabilitate them or eliminate them from existence if they are beyond redemption
Overseeing their patrols are Decker and Ford who give the weekly assignments
Deacon Jones acts as series narrator and appears on screen as the Deacon
The Deacon is the representation of the wrathful Old Testament version of God
He is very strict bad tempered and unforgiving
Chandler s teenage son Ben played by Tony Denman occasionally appears
Chandler guides him in subtle ways
The Corps itself functions much like any police force does with various departments and a city based structure
Paramedics supply officers spies intelligence agents forensic specialists therapists and munitions experts are all on hand to help with cases
They operate throughout the world in various cities
Chandler and Henry work out of the Hollywood station
They are based at Ravenswood a high rise art deco establishment which also doubles as purgatory
All the agents of the Corps have gone through a violent mortal death but merely being alive again does not render them immortal
They can die again and they face immediate judgement upon dying which may be a problem for those who have not completed their redemption
Injury can happen to them as can all the usual mental anguish that mortals suffer
Corps agents have no magical powers to give them an advantage over the opposition
Another limitation is that agents of the Corps cannot have any intimate contact with mortals
They also cannot overtly contact their friends and family from before they died
The Corps battle with two types of foes Faustians and Morlocks
The Faustians are ordinary people who have made a deal with the forces of evil and bask in the fortunes that such a deal allows them on Earth
The Morlocks are Faustians who have died their mortal death and are now the ground troops for the dark side evil s equivalent to the Corps
They are identifiable as people who have suddenly become sarcastic and courageous to extreme degrees
In addition mirrors reveal the true nature of Morlocks their reflections are twisted and demonic
Unlike Corps agents Morlocks have superhuman resilience and they cannot be easily killed
Any member of the Corps who dies at the hands of a Morlock immediately becomes a Morlock as well
Both Morlocks and the Corps have double agents planted in each other s ranks

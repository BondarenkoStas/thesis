When he discovers that his ex wife Stacie is getting married to her boyfriend Matt George grows despondent
After dropping off an audition tape of him practicing his sports announcements George goes to help his son s soccer team practice
The team isn t very good with the coach giving little attention to his players
The team s parents quickly pressure Stacie to ask George to become the new coach which he reluctantly agrees to
Once coach George attracts the attentions of various mothers and receives a bribe from Carl King who wants him to give his children preferential treatment
He specifically draws attention from the divorced Barb ex sportscaster Denise and Carl s wife Patti
Denise appears to be particularly forward with George sending him an e mail telling him that she s thinking of him
At practice the next day George is invited to a dinner party at Carl s house is approached by Barb and is also told by Denise that she has been given a copy of his audition tape to watch and pass along
At Carl s party George learns that Carl has been having affairs and that his wife is aware of his infidelities unbeknownst to Carl
Carl then lends George a Ferrari under the implication that he takes care of his friends which George uses to drive to see Stacie
The two discuss what could have developed between the two of them to which Stacie says that she doesn t wonder about the past anymore
When he gets home he discovers Barb waiting for him
She confesses that she s very lonely and has set up a dating profile in order to find a match
After asking him if he finds her attractive the two sleep together
The following day George is called by Carl who asks him to pick up some money from Patti in order to bail him out of jail as he got into a fight at the party

During this time George discovers that Lewis is sad that his mother is marrying Matt and that he won t call Matt dad
George is then called by Denise who informs him that ESPN is looking for a new soccer sportscaster and that he must come to the studio to record a tape

George manages to later coax Lewis into playing soccer in the rain which both of them finds fun
Meanwhile Stacie and George begin to reconnect romantically which causes small rifts in her relationship with Matt
George manages to earn the job with ESPN but this necessitates his moving across the country to Connecticut
He asks Stacie to come with him
She initially refuses but then he meets her at her car and she kisses him
At the game later that same day George finds that Barb has begun to date his landlord and that Carl has discovered pictures of Patti in George s house from the time she came on to him
The two men begin to fight which Stacie witnesses
Stacie sees the pictures which upsets her despite George s claiming that it wasn t what it looked like
During the fight Lewis s team wins the game
After the game George leaves for his new job

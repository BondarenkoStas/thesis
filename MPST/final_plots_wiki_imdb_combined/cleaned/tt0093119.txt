A spacecraft flies near Earth and releases a bright object which enters the atmosphere
In the Val Verde jungle Major Alan Dutch Schaefer and his team medic Mac Elliot tracker Billy Sole gunner Blaine Cooper explosives expert Jorge Poncho Ram√≠rez and radio operator Rick Hawkins are tasked by the CIA with rescuing an official held hostage by insurgents
CIA agent liaison and former US Army Colonel George Dillon a former commando and an old friend of Dutch is assigned to supervise the team despite Dutch s reservations
The team discovers the wreckage of a chopper and three skinned corpses whom Dutch identifies as members of a U S Army Special Forces unit he knew personally
They reach the insurgent camp and kill the soldiers including a Soviet intelligence officer searching through secret CIA documents
Confronted by Dutch Dillon admits the mission was a setup to retrieve intelligence from captured operatives and that the dead unit disappeared weeks earlier in a failed rescue
After capturing a guerilla named Anna the group proceeds to extraction unaware that they are being tracked with thermal imaging by an unseen observer
Anna escapes and is chased by Hawkins but they are ambushed by the creature
It spares Anna but kills Hawkins and drags his body away
Dutch organizes a manhunt during which Blaine is killed by the creature s plasma weapon
An enraged Mac initiates a firefight which wounds the creature revealing luminescent green blood but fails to draw it out
The unit regroups and questions Anna learning that their stalker is a creature locals call el demonio que hace trofeos de los hombres
That night Mac mistakes a wild pig for the creature and kills it
In the confusion the creature steals Blaine s body leading Dutch to realize their enemy uses the trees to travel
The next day an attempt to trap the creature fails leaving Poncho injured
Mac and Dillon pursue the alien but it outwits and kills them both
It catches up with the others killing Billy and Poncho and wounding Dutch
Realizing the creature does not target unarmed prey because there is no sport Dutch sends Anna to the helicopter unarmed
The creature pursues him through a river causing its cloaking device to malfunction
Though the creature is only a few feet from Dutch he does not see him and moves on
Dutch realizes that mud covering his body is masking his heat signature from the creature s thermal sensor
While the creature removes the spinal columns from the bodies Dutch crafts traps and weapons and lures the creature with a war cry
He disables its cloaking device and inflicts minor injuries but is cornered
Acknowledging Dutch as a worthy foe the creature discards its mask and weapon and engages him in hand to hand combat
Dutch is almost beaten but crushes the creature under a trap s counterweight
As the creature lies dying Dutch asks What the hell are you
but it simply repeats the question in garbled English before activating a self destruct device echoing Billy s laughter as the countdown begins
Dutch takes cover just before the self destruct device explodes in a mushroom cloud
He is picked up by his commander General Phillips and Anna in the helicopter

In 2007 at the Dixmor Asylum for the Criminally Insane a severe thunderstorm causes the security system at the asylum to momentarily go offline opening the cell doors throughout the facility resulting in the populace wandering freely through the corridors
Two such inmates are Daniel Lamb and Leo Kasper
Daniel is disoriented and partly amnesiac unable to remember how or why he came to Dixmor
Under Leo s guidance they escape the facility and make their way to the ruins of Daniel s old home
Inside Daniel recovers medication which Leo says he left there for himself in the event of his forgetting the past
The medication helps to clear his head somewhat and he begins to remember fragments of his former life
He and Leo then set out to unravel the secrets of Daniel s past all the while pursued by bounty hunters and agents of a mysterious organization called The Project
As the plot unfolds Daniel learns that he was once a top scientist in the employ of the Pickman Project a government sponsored weapons program involving brainwashing and mind control techniques
The Project s goal was to create the perfect assassin to accomplish this they developed the Pickman Bridge a brain implant containing the personality and skills of a trained assassin which could be activated on command
In theory the two personalities could co exist in the same mind completely unaware of one another
The idea was that the assassin could be remotely triggered carry out his mission and then revert to the original persona who would have no memory of what he had just done hence would be immune to interrogation
As Daniel puts the clues together and begins to remember more of his past he and Leo set out to find Dr Whyte a Project researcher and one of Daniel s co workers
However before they can get to her they are ambushed and sedated
Daniel wakes up in a room with Whyte who reveals the truth to him
Six years prior with the Project s funds under threat Daniel volunteered himself to test the Pickman Bridge hoping that the resulting payoff would allow him to clear his family s debts and provide a financially secure future
However the Bridge malfunctioned soon after it was implanted causing Daniel to suffer from dissociative identity disorder resulting in him being able to directly communicate with the implanted personality who he perceives as a real person Leo Kasper
Whyte explains that Leo is dangerously unstable and has been working against Daniel from the very beginning
She reveals that after the implant malfunctioned Leo s personality asserted itself suppressing Daniel s own and he went on a rampage across the city murdering police officers and members of the Project destroying the Project s records of Daniel and himself and finally making his way to Daniel s household and killing his wife
His goal was to weaken Daniel s grip on reality to the point where Leo could take complete and total control of his mind
However the Project caught Daniel Leo after the murder erased his memory torched his house and had him committed to Dixmor where they had been working to study the effects of the implant and repair the damage without success
Upon learning the truth Daniel determines that he must destroy Leo once and for all
He enters a deep hypnotic state and faces off against Leo within the confines of his own mind
He is finally able to let go of the guilt he feels over his wife s death allowing him to kill Leo and assert control
Having done so he awakens on a deserted road in San Andreas county with his memory erased once more
However he is holding an envelope informing him that his name is David Joiner providing him with a new home address at 526 Hope Street Apartment B in San Fierro and wishing him luck
Daniel briefly hesitates before walking towards San Fierro
The game also includes an alternate final level where the final battle is played from Leo s perspective
He successfully destroys Daniel s personality and wakes up in control of his mind and body
Whyte who thinks she is speaking to Daniel asks him if he is okay to which he replies he is keen to get back to work on the Bridge
As he looks at himself in the mirror Daniel sees Leo s reflection looking back at him

The story revolves around a blind boy named Mohammed who is released from his special school in Tehran for summer vacation
His father shamed and burdened by Mohammed s blindness arrives late to pick him up and then tries to convince the headmaster to keep Mohammed over the summer
The headmaster refuses so Mohammed s father eventually takes him home
Mohammed s father who is a widower now wants to marry a local girl and is preparing for the wedding
He approaches the girl s parents with gifts and they give him
He tries to hide the fact that he has a blind son because he fears the girl s family will see that as a bad omen
Meanwhile Mohammed happily roams around the beautiful hills of his village with his sisters
He touches and feels the nature around him counting the sounds of animals and imitating them
He displays a unique attitude towards nature and seems to understand its rhythms and textures as a language
Mohammed goes to the local school with his sisters and reads the lessons from his textbook in Braille which amazes the children and the teacher
Fearing his bride to be s family will learn of Mohammed his father takes him away and leaves him with a blind carpenter who agrees to make him an apprentice
The blind carpenter mentors the boy who wants to see God
Mohammad says God does not love him and thus made him blind and tells him about how his teacher told him that God loves them more as they are blind but then asks why God should make him blind if he loves him more
He also tells him that he wanted to be able to see God to which his teacher had said that God is everywhere and that you can also feel God
The carpenter then just says that he agrees with his teacher and walks away possibly affected by the boy s words as he himself is blind
Mohammed s grandmother is heartbroken when she realizes that Hashem has given him away to a blind carpenter and she falls ill She leaves the family home but Hashem tries to convince her to stay back questioning his destiny wondering why he lost his father as a young boy asking why God has taken away his wife and cursed him with a blind boy and asking his mother what she did for him
Mohammed s grandmother faints on her way so Hashem carries her back home
Eventually Mohammed s grandmother dies
The bride s family sees this as a bad omen and the wedding is called off
His hopes destroyed Hashem decides to bring him back
The film shows glimpses of shame and pity that Hashem felt for himself and his son all along
He goes back to the blind carpenter and takes back Mohammed
They head for home through the woods
As they cross a small crudely made wooden bridge over a stream the bridge collapses and Mohammed falls into the water and is carried away by the strong currents
For a moment his father stands petrified looking on in shock at the sight of his son being dragged away he appears to be mentally torn between rescuing him and finally becoming free of this lifelong burden
Moments later he makes his decision and dashes into the river and is also carried along swiftly by the roaring water behind Mohammed
As the film ends Hashem wakes up on the shore of the Caspian Sea and sees Mohammed lying motionless a short distance away
He drags himself up and stumbles towards Mohammed s body and takes it in his arms
In the ending scene Hashem sits weeping over his son s body and looking to the skies
You can hear the sound of a woodpecker and Mohammed s fingers slowly start to move perhaps he is reading the sound with his fingers as if they are Braille dots
Maybe he thinks the woodpecker is giving clues about the color of God
Or maybe he has finally touched God

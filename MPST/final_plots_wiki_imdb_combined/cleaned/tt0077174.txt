16 year old Gail Osborne is a typical high school student with a passion for photography
Six months ago she and her parents moved from New York to a smaller town due to her father Neil s claim the city was too dangerous following a burglary
Gail a high spirited romantic initially started dating classmate E K
Miller but he broke off their relationship because Gail was unwilling to sleep with him
Now Gail is dating Steve Pastorinis despite her overprotective mother s objections
After a while she receives an anonymous letter which says I am watching you
Gail thinks the letter is creepy but is convinced by her best friend Allison Bremer that it is a practical joke from some student
However when another note is found saying I know where you are I m watching you you tramp I m coming after you and phone calls from a strange man laughing in a creepy way
Gail decides to warn her principal who informs her it could be the act of her current or former boyfriend someone she s rejected or perhaps someone she s knows that s hanging around
One day Gail tries to tell her mother Anne about the stalking but Anne is too busy to pay attention and blows Gail off
Therefore Gail ditches school and heads to San Francisco to visit her father at work
There she finds out her father has been fired
Back home she confronts her mother with this who demands her to keep silent so Neil will not feel ashamed
Gail realizes more serious matters are going on in her life and decides to no longer pay attention to the notes and phone calls
One day when she s late for class there is another message sticking out of her locker
A black and white picture of herself that she took in photography class with the word RAPE all in red across her face
One night she is babysitting the children of Jessica Hirsch who is dating Gail s teacher Chris Elden
She receives a phone call from her boyfriend Steve Pastorinis and he asks if he can come over after work and spend time together
Gail relieved says yes and he tells her he ll be there soon
The phone rings again thinking it s Steve she answers but it s the same stalker laughing hysterically asking Are you in the house alone
Afraid Gail locks the door and windows all around the house
Someone knocks on the front door
Excited to see Steve Gail opens the door and sees it s Allison s boyfriend Phil Lawver who stopped by
Phil asks if Allison is around because she said she was going to come by and Gail responds she isn t there
Phil then asks to use the phone to call Allison s house
Phil picks up the receiver and dials the number but then puts his finger on the receiving end to cancel the call and then pretends to be on the phone with Allison s mother while pulling out a handkerchief wiping off the phone
Gail looks over and sees him wiping the phone and he looks back at her before dropping the phone on the ground
He looks at her and says I really had you fooled didn t I
Gail lets out a sigh of relief figuring he was pulling a prank on her
Phil continues saying Had you real scared
Gail upset replies Phil will you cut it out showing fear
Phil then says in a raspy creepy voice Are you in the house alone
Phil then reveals that it wasn t a prank and that he s been stalking her that he knows all about her he knows what she likes he s been watching her a long time he s been real patient that he s waited for her and not to give him that lily white virgin stuff cause he knows she has nothing to lose
He then attacks her forces her down on the ground and proceeds to rape her
He sits up sweaty looks down at her beaten bloody body and runs out of the house
Due to the trauma Gail is hospitalized and at first refuses to say that Phil raped her claiming it was all a blur knowing she won t be believed refusing to return to school
Another female officer comes in to ask if she can try to remember and Gail continues to lie out of fear
The female officer leaves but tells her that if she changes her mind to call her at the station
She also mentions that if Gail doesn t give her a name they have no case and her attacker can do this to someone else
Fearing that some other girl might endure what she just went through she tells the officer it was Phillip Lawver
Her father is outraged at Phil but finds out they can not sue him because Phil s father is a close friend of the local judge
The fact Gail recently lost her virginity to Steve also plays a role
Gail is eventually encouraged by her teacher Malevich not to be afraid any longer and she returns to school
There she finds out another girl is receiving the same creepy notes
Determined to stop Phil she attempts to catch him with her camera
Phil however is on to her and attempts to beat her up but he is caught by Steve
In the end Phil pleads guilty to assault but is not charged with rape
He has since disappeared and one rumor has it he is in a boarding school in New Hampshire

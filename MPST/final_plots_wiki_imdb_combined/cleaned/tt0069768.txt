Told as a flashback to the early 21st century with a wraparound sequence narrated by the orangutan Lawgiver in North America 2670 A D this sequel follows the ape leader Caesar years after a global nuclear war has destroyed civilization
In this post nuclear society Caesar tries to cultivate peace between the apes and the surviving humans
A gorilla general named Aldo however opposes this and plots Caesar s downfall
Caesar is married to Lisa the female ape of the previous film and they have a son named Cornelius in honor of Caesar s father
Caesar regrets never having known his parents until his human assistant MacDonald tells him about an archive film of his parents where he can also learn about the future
The archives are located in the Forbidden City now a radioactive ruin
After obtaining a geiger counter and weapons from the armory Caesar travels with MacDonald and orangutan Virgil to the Forbidden City and sneaks in to find the archives
However there are mutants still living there under the command of Governor Kolp
Caesar and his party view the recordings of Cornelius and Zira and learn about the future of the world but barely have time to study the tapes before they have to escape being captured
Caesar assembles a meeting to report his discoveries at the Forbidden City
Aldo objects when some humans show up and he leads the gorillas away
A team of scouts sent by Governor Kolp return and tell him about the Ape City
Kolp considers this covert trip by Caesar an act of espionage
His assistant Méndez believes they did nothing wrong and should be left alone but Governor Kolp stubbornly declares war on Ape City mustering the mutant humans to destroy the ape society
Aldo is furious that Caesar wants to co exist peacefully with humans and plots a coup d état in order to become the Ape leader himself
Cornelius overhears this while trying to catch his escaped pet squirrel in a nearby tree
Aldo spots him and hacks the tree branch down critically injuring Cornelius
After a gorilla scouting pair is attacked by the approaching humans Aldo orders all humans to be corralled and leads the gorillas to loot the weapons armory much to Virgil s dismay
Cornelius eventually dies from his wounds leaving Caesar devastated but not without leaving him with a warning about Aldo s coup
It is at that moment that Kolp s ragtag force launches their attack against Ape City
The initial mutant attack succeeds forcing Caesar to order the defenders to fall back
When Kolp finds Caesar lying among dozens of apes he threatens to kill him but the fallen apes who were feigning death or hiding on Caesar s orders launch a counter attack that captures most of the mutants
Kolp and his remaining forces are killed by Aldo s troops while attempting to retreat
After the battle Aldo wants to kill the penned humans but Caesar shields them
Aldo declares that Caesar should be killed if he shields the humans
However Virgil reveals Aldo s responsibility for Cornelius death and the breaking of the ape community s most sacred law
An infuriated Caesar pursues Aldo up a large tree resulting in Aldo falling to his death during the fight
Caesar then attempts to free the humans but they refuse to leave the pen unless humans are treated as equals
Caesar then realizes the apes are just as despicable as the former slave owners
The apes and humans then decide to coexist with one another and begin a new society
The Lawgiver finishes his wrap around narration
It s revealed he s talking to a group of young humans and apes apes and humans have continued to coexist in peace
When asked by a human child Who knows about the future
the Lawgiver replies Perhaps only the dead

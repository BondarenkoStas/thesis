Charlie Brown decides to enter the Junior Olympics at his school after it is revealed he is not going on vacation after all
The decathlon is the only thing left open and Charlie Brown accepts the challenge
Peppermint Patty who is the school s coordinator for the Junior Olympics oversees Charlie s rigorous training for the event
Marcie also watches and Snoopy works out with him
During a review of the ten events Patty worries of whether or not he could win and decides to enter Marcie to back him up
On day one Charlie is introduced to his competitors Marcie Freddie Fabulous from Fremont and The Masked Marvel
He places well in the first five events enough to place him in third after the day is over
Lucy states she is annoyed that Charlie Brown cannot be a total blockhead by his third place ranking as the Masked Marvel came in dead last
Day two starts off bad for Charlie
First he feels nervous due to the increased pressure then he performs badly in the 110m high hurdles
However after a tough talk from Peppermint Patty a great showing in the pole vault and first place finishes in the discus and javelin throw catapults him into first place
Now it s all on the 1500m run to finish it all off and be the school s hero
When Charlie Brown gains the lead over Freddie Fabulous Lucy is aghast that the world must be ending as Charlie Brown is coming in first
Unfortunately after taking the lead Charlie Brown closes his eyes and dreams of his victory and winds up running off the track off the school grounds and out of contention
It is learned afterward that their school still wins the Junior Olympics due to Marcie winning the 1500m and the disqualifications of Freddie Fabulous and The Masked Marvel
Peppermint Patty consoles Charlie Brown telling him that everybody knows he did his best
Marcie arrives and Charlie Brown congratulates her on the win
Marcie in turn replies You re a great competitor and a real gentleman
I think you re the greatest Charles
Uncharacteristically she then lifts her glasses and winks at Charlie Brown who blushes

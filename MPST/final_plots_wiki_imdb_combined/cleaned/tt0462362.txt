On his way home from his drab run of the mill job drab run of the mill Harry Balbo is stopped on the corner by a homeless man and asked whether he can spare any change so that he can get something to eat
Harry isn t carrying any change but he does stop at a convenience store to buy him a hotdog
When he gets back to the corner the man is nowhere to be seen until the headlights of a passing car show him having his blood drained by a beautiful girl with fangs
She then rips off his head and leaps through a window three stories high
Of course nobody believes his story not LAPD Detective Michael Loper not coworker Chet and not even Javier the other jerk he works with
The only one who gives some credence to his story is Ronnie Klein the convenience store clerk but Ronnie has problems of his own
His new chick is so hot for sex that she s draining him of all his energy The next night when Harry has trouble sleeping he wanders out to the crime scene where he sees the chalk outline of the headless victim drawn on the sidewalk and has a feeling that Ronnie might be in danger
He climbs up the fire escape outside Ronnie s apartment and peeks in the bedroom window to see Ronnie having his blood drained by the same girl that ripped off the head of the homeless man
Unfortunately Harry knocks over a flowerpot which alerts the girl to his presence
She tears past him gashing his cheek on the way
The next day when Harry hears that Ronnie has been found dead he becomes certain that the girl is a vampire
Searching the internet he finds a website all about vampires sends mail to the owner who calls himself Nightstalker and asks what to do
Nightstalker says that the only thing he can do is to find the vampire stake her and cut off her head
Harry refuses to do that on grounds that it s murder Turns out that Nightstalker lives in the same apartment building where Harry lives and works part time doing maintenance as he finds out when Strickland in 3D calls him to fix a stopped up toilet
Strickland an L4 quadriplegic works out of his apartment tracking vampires
He is currently following the whereabouts of nine of them including the one in Los Angeles
She set up housekeeping in L A about two months ago Strickland explains and shows Harry the map he has made of her known killings and the areas where he thinks she might be resting during the daytime
By searching the tax records for delinquent payments he has located 12 possible abandoned buildings she could be calling home Harry decides to try and find the vampire before she finds him
The next day he calls in sick
Then armed with the map and an armload of wirecutters crowbars sledgehammers stakes and a big cleaver he begins searching through the selected buildings
In the last one he comes upon the vampire asleep on the floor
Just as he s about to pound the stake through her chest she wakes up and pleads with him not to kill her
I have to eat to live just like you she says pitifully and Harry can t kill her
Instead he comes up with a plan
He steals a load of steel pipes from his company and builds a cage in the basement of his apartment building
That night he goes out looking for her
When she sees him she starts chasing him
Harry runs back into his apartment building leading her down to the basement and straight into the cage
Before she realizes what s happening Harry slams the cage shut and locks it At first the vampire is enraged
When she calms down she introduces herself as Tatiana and tries to sweet talk Harry into letting her go free
When Harry refuses she tells him that he must either feed her or kill her
Harry agrees to feed her
The next day he brings home a rabbit
She begrudgingly accepts it but suggests that Harry bring home an enemy or at least someone he doesn t like
The only person who fits that bill is Javy the jerk at work that hounds him relentlessly but Harry refuses When Strickland finds out that Harry has encaged the vampire rather than killing her he is livid
He tells Harry the story of how he was paralyzed at 18 years of age when his army troop came upon a village in Vietnam where every man woman and child had been wiped out by two vampires a male and his concubine
It took all their firepower and then a flamethrower to destroy the male but then his girlfriend showed up and single handedly wiped out every one of the soldiers in Strickland s unit with the exception of Strickland
Him she batted just once breaking his spine
He lay there pretending to be dead until a reinforcement troop found him and took him to a hospital after wiping out the female vamp with napalm
Strickland suggests that Harry kill Tatiana now before she overpowers him
He recommends that Harry find himself a new girlfriend
Harry tries to kiss Cindi a girl who lives down the hallway from him when she brings him a dish of lasagna but Cindi rebuffs him Tatiana is having a hard time living on rabbit blood and keeps requesting that Harry bring home Javier for her because she needs human blood
One day a meter reader comes down in the basement and finds Tatiana in the cage
She begs him to let her out but he offers only to get the police so she grabs him through the bars and feeds on him leaving the body for Harry to dispose of
Realizing that rabbits aren t going to do it for Tatiana Harry goes online and buys her a pint of human blood and brings it to her on a plate with a red rose but she tosses it across the room refusing to drink it because it s dead blood Poor Harry
He s falling in love with Tatiana
She haunts his dreams and offers to love him back in ways that he can only imagine
Meanwhile he s making mistakes at work sending out the wrong flanges and his theft of the steel pipes has caught up with him
When Chet informs him that Mr Henderson from the main office is coming to see him and Javy starts taunting Harry about how he s going to lose his job Harry has had it
He confesses to Javy about the insatiable girl he has in his basement and how she needs more lovers than just him
Javier who thinks of himself as a sexual Tyrannosaurus is more than happy to meet Tatiana and eagerly arrives at Harry s apartment decked out with his bag of love toys
At the last minute however Harry has a change of heart and tries to talk Javy out of going into the basement
Javy slugs Harry knocking him out and grabs the keys When Javy sees Tatiana he is aroused and willing to help her satisfy her appetite
She asks him to get the key on the wall so that he can open the cage
When he comes closer she begins caressing his arm until she can control herself no longer and bites down
Harry stumbles down the stairs and tries to pull Javy away from Tatiana but she rips off his arm pulls his entire body into the cage and proceeds to drain him dry Meanwhile the body of the meter reader has been uncovered in a plastic bag in the dump and Detective Loper and his partner have been able to identify the fingerprints on the bag as belonging to Harry Balbo
From the meter reader s meter they have gotten the address of the last place he visited Harry s apartment building
After the detectives visit Harry s workplace looking for him Chet gives Harry a call and warns him that the cops are on the way
Knowing that it s all over Harry calls Strickland to say goodbye
Then he offers himself to Tatiana along with the key to her cage
Tatiana is reluctant but finally agrees to turn him
After the deed is done Harry goes upstairs knocks on Cindi s door hands her a rose and asks to be fed
She invites him in
In the final scene Strickland waits in his wheelchair facing the front door a loaded rifle in his hand
Come on you motherf rs he shouts
I know you re out there so come and get me
Come on

The story begins when Winnie the Pooh is on his way to his thoughtful spot
Today is a very windy day
But as Pooh sits thinking Gopher pops out of the ground and advises Pooh to leave the spot because of it being Winds day
Pooh having misunderstood his warning goes across the Hundred Acre Wood to wish everyone a happy Winds day
Pooh first goes to his friend Piglet who lives in a beech tree
Piglet initially came out to rake leaves but the wind proves too strong for him to handle
Piglet is nearly blown away but Pooh quickly hangs on to him by his scarf like a kite on a string
As Pooh struggles to keep a hold of the scarf he passes by Kanga and Roo wishing them both a happy Winds day Eeyore whose stick house Pooh breaks as he passes and finally Rabbit who Pooh inadvertently helps harvest the carrots in his vegetable garden as he slides by
The blustery wind finally blows Pooh and Piglet over to Owl s treehouse where he invites them in
Pooh wishes Owl a happy Winds day as he has everyone else but Owl informs them that the wind is due to a mild spring zephyr rather than to a particular holiday
While Owl begins telling Pooh and Piglet stories of adventures his relatives had the strong wind rocks his house back and forth causing it to sway and eventually the tree and house both collapse
Owl blames Pooh at first but Pooh says he did not do it
Christopher Robin and the others come and examine the wrecked house and since it cannot be repaired Eeyore volunteers to seek out a new house for Owl who proceeds to tell the others more stories of his relatives for quite some time talking from page 41 to page 62
Meanwhile on page 62 as night falls the wind is still blowing and Pooh is kept awake by growling and scratching noise and he opens his door for the visitor outside
An orange bouncing tiger named Tigger emerges from outside rolling over Pooh and sitting on him
Tigger introduces himself with his signature song and informs Pooh that he has come looking for something to eat
He then decides to try some of Pooh s honey but after some tastes he gets disgusted and decides that Tiggers don t like honey
Before leaving Pooh s house Tigger tells him that there are Heffalumps and Woozles in the forest that steal honey
Pooh frightened by Tigger s tale stays up to guard his honey but eventually falls fast asleep
As he is sleeping he has a nightmare about Heffalumps and Woozles stealing his honey and chasing him around until he wakes up during a flood inducing rainfall
Later Piglet is washed away from his home
He writes a bottle note for help just before the waters carry him off sitting on a chair
Pooh manages to reach higher ground with only ten honey pots
However as he is eating some of the honey the rising waters carry him away
Kanga Roo Rabbit and Tigger all gather at Christopher Robin s house which is situated on the highest ground while Eeyore continues house hunting for Owl
Roo finds Piglet s bottle and Owl flies off to tell Piglet that help is on the way
Owl manages to reach Piglet and Pooh but before he can inform them of the impending rescue a waterfall threatens to carry them all over the side
Pooh switches places with Piglet as they take the plunge and luckily for them the waterfall washes them right into Christopher Robin s yard
Thinking that Pooh had rescued Piglet Christopher Robin decides to throw a party celebrating Pooh s heroic deed
During the party Eeyore announces that he has found a new home for Owl
He leads everyone over to his discovery which known to everyone except for Owl and Eeyore is Piglet s beech tree
Owl is very impressed with the house but before anyone can tell him who the home belongs to Piglet decides that Owl should have the house
Pooh decides to allow Piglet to move into his home and is very impressed by his selflessness asks Christopher Robin to make the hero party for two instead of one

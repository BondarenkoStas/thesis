The Enterprise has traveled to the Pentarus system where Captain Picard must mediate a dispute among some miners on the fifth planet
Wesley Crusher receives word that he has been accepted to Starfleet Academy and for his final mission he will accompany Picard on his shuttle trip to Pentarus V A distress call comes in from Gamilon V where an unidentified vessel has entered orbit and is giving off lethal doses of radiation
Picard orders Riker to take the Enterprise to resolve that situation while he and Wesley travel in a shuttle sent by the miners commanded by Captain Dirgo
En route Dirgo s shuttle malfunctions and they are forced to crash land on the surface of a harsh desert like moon
Though they are unharmed the shuttle is beyond repair and its communication systems and food replicators are disabled
Dirgo admits he has no emergency supplies on board so they are forced to search for shelter and water
With his tricorder Wesley identifies some caves and a potential source of water some distance away and the three set out across the desert
Reaching a cave they find a fountain like water source but it is protected by a crystalline forcefield
Dirgo attempts to use a phaser to destroy the field but this activates a burst of energy from the fountain which encases the phaser in an impenetrable shell and causes a rock slide Picard pushes Wesley out of the way but is severely injured in doing so
Meanwhile the Enterprise has arrived at Gamilon V finding the unidentified ship is an abandoned garbage scow filled with radioactive waste
Their initial attempt to attach thrusters to the barge to propel it through an asteroid belt into the Gamilon sun remotely fails and Commander Riker is forced to attempt to tow the barge themselves using the tractor beam exposing the crew to the lethal radiation
As Wesley continues to analyze the forcefield Dirgo becomes impatient and attempts to breach the field again but this time the energy burst encases him as well killing him
Picard weak from his injuries gives Wesley advice about the academy and tells him he is proud of him
Wesley refuses to give up
Meanwhile the Enterprise despite the rising lethal radiation levels on board manages to get the barge headed into the sun and speeds off to help in the search for the shuttle
Wesley continues to study the fountain and devises a plan to disable the forcefield
He fires his phaser at the fountain to attract the energy defense mechanism but reprograms it using his tricorder to disable the field instead and is finally able to access the water
Shortly thereafter the Enterprise locates the wreckage of the mining shuttle and Picard and Wesley are rescued
As Picard is carried from the cave he tells Wesley that he will be missed

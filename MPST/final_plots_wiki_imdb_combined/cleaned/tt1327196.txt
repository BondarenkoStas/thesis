Ever wake up with someone you ve never met
It s awkward
You don t know where you are or how you got there
Has that ever happened to you
Your wallet keys and cell phone have been stolen
You re locked in a crappy apartment on the 16Th floor of a high rise in Newark and the only person who can hear you scream for help is Pixie the ex hooker next door who s pissed at you because she s trying to give her boyfriend Louie the Pixie L Amour Hula Special
That s what happens to Chad a body building underwear salesman from Brazil who loves every inch of himself and Annie a Catholic kindergarten teacher from Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrows Pixie s not having a great day either
Once she was the highest paid hooker in Newark but she gave up all her other tricks when Louie said he was going to divorce his wife and they would be together
That was 32 years ago today and she s beginning to think he s never going to leave her
Louie has been seeing her every Wednesday morning from nine to eleven except during Lent
He gives her up for Lent Meanwhile Zander the guy who locked Chad and Annie in his apartment shows up says he s a cab driver and they stiffed him for his fare last night and he s not going to let them out until he gets his money
Annie signs a check for him because she has an entire kindergarten waiting for her not to mention a nun the kids call Sister Quasimodo
Chad gives him his ATM code because he has a meeting for a 3 million account for men s fiber filled shorts
Zander leaves to get his money Louie agrees to let Pixie give him her hula special but he wants to do it on the clothes dryer
He likes the vibration
Louie gets up on the dryer
Pixie gets up on the washer but when Louie twists around to turn the dryer on his back goes out
He can t move
He screams in agony
Pixie says she ll call 9 1 1
Louie screams even louder
No 911
No 911
Why Not
They ll take you to the hospital
And Medusa will find out about us
She ll skin me alive
She ll take every dime I ve got and make me pay alimony until I m dead
That ll be better than dying right here on the dryer
Louie writhes in pain It s not my heart
I m not going to die right here on the dryer
Ya got any drugs
Pixie thinks back Yeah
I got Maui Wowie
She whips out her plastic bag of stash dated 1986
Louie whines We re gonna smoke dope from the last century
Meanwhile Bubbles Zander s girlfriend who is not too bright knocks on Zander s door Sugar Buns
Let me in
I forgot my keys at work
Annie answers I can t let you in
Zander s got these locks that won t open from the inside
Bubbles answers Oh yeah
Why does he have those crazy locks on there
I don t know
I m asking you
What are you doing in my boyfriends apartment
I don t know
I woke up in here and I couldn t get out
When Bubbles finds out that Zander brought Annie and a man home with him her mind boggles with the possibilities
I m going to kill him
She storms off
Meanwhile Louie and Pixie light up and choke their brains out on the twenty five year old weed Then Annie and Chad begin to remember last night
They lie down on the bed Annie looks deeply into his eyes Chad
Was I any good
You were very pleasant
What should I do to improve
Moving would help
Zander pounds on the door with his gun
Excuse me folks
I m back
Louie stoned out of his mind asks Pixie if she s ready to give him The Pixie L Amour Hula Special
Equally buzzed she manages to get up on her knees on top of the washer and crawl over to him
We hear a crack
She screams
Louie asks What is it
Is it your back
No
It s my hip
We gotta get to the phone
I don t care if Medusa finds out
But Louie still can t move and she can t move
Now they re the ones screaming for help
What a way to start the day We follow our six characters as they bob and weave through the labarynth of love always going somewhere one would never expect and just when it seems nothing is going to work out everything changes one night in Newark

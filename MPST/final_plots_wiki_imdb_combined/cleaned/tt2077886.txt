Act I It is now 1881
As Carlotta the Opéra s resident soprano prima donna rehearses for that evening s performance a backdrop collapses without warning
The anxious cast members whisper about The Phantom of the Opera who Carlotta reveals has been troubling the Opera Populaire for the past three years
The Opera s new owners Firmin and André try to downplay the incident but Carlotta angrily chastises the pair for saying these things do happen and storms offstage closely followed by Monsieur Piangi
Meg Giry the daughter of the Opéra s ballet mistress Madame Giry tells Firmin and André that Christine Daaé a chorus girl and orphaned daughter of a prominent violinist has been well taught and could sing Carlotta s role
With cancellation of the performance their only alternative the owners reluctantly audition Christine and to their surprise she is exceptional in the role
Backstage after her triumphant début Christine confesses to Meg that she knows her mysterious teacher only as an invisible Angel of Music
The new patron Raoul Vicomte de Chagny finds Christine his old childhood playmate in her dressing room
Christine reminds Raoul about the Angel of Music stories that her late father used to tell them and confides that the Angel has been visiting her and given her her astonishing voice
Raoul good naturedly accepts her revelation and invites her to dinner
Christine to his puzzlement is not as willing claiming that her Angel is a stern taskmaster and that he will not be pleased by her absence
Raoul jokingly states that he will not keep her up late and exits telling her that he ll be back for her in two minutes

Christine fearfully calls after him that things have changed as the jealous Angel of Music condemns Raoul for sharing in my triumph
Christine begs him to reveal himself
The Angel obliges and materialises in her mirror
The mirror opens revealing the Angel to be the Phantom of the Opera who leads Christine away
Raoul finds Christine s dressing room empty and calls out for her

The Phantom and Christine cross a subterranean lake to his secret lair beneath the Opéra house

The Phantom explains that he has chosen Christine to sing his music and serenades her
Overwhelmed Christine faints and the Phantom carries her to a bed and expresses his adoration for her
As the Phantom composes music at his organ Christine awakens to the sound of the monkey music box
She slips up behind the Phantom lifts his mask and beholds his face
The Phantom rails at her damning her for her curiosity as Christine hides herself in fear
The Phantom ruefully expresses his longing to look normal and to be loved by her

Christine returns the Phantom s mask to him and the Phantom leads her back to the Opéra house
Meanwhile inside the Opéra House Joseph Buquet the Opéra s chief stagehand regales the chorus girls with tales of the Opéra Ghost and his magical lasso
Madame Giry warns Buquet to exercise restraint
In the managers office André and Firman read notes from the Phantom aloud and are interrupted by Raoul who accuses them of sending him a note saying that he should make no attempt to see Christine again
Carlotta and Piangi then burst into the office demanding to know who sent Carlotta a note saying that her days at the Opera Populaire are numbered
As André and Firmin try to calm the distressed Carlotta Madame Giry delivers another note from the Phantom he demands that Christine replace Carlotta in the new opera Il Muto or there will be a terrible disaster beyond imagination
Firmin and André assure the enraged Carlotta that she will remain the star begging her to entrance us once again
The performance begins well with André and Firmin joking about the disaster the Phantom threatened
The Phantom s voice suddenly cuts through the performance angrily reminding them that he had instructed them to keep Box 5 empty for his use
As Christine whispers that she knows the Phantom is near Carlotte reminds her that her role is silent calling her a little toad
The Phantom states that it is Carlotta who is the toad and reduces Carlotta s voice to a frog like croak
Firmin quickly tries to calm the situation by telling the audience that Christine will take over the starring role moving forward the ballet to keep the audience entertained
Suddenly the corpse of Buquet hanging from the Phantom s magical lasso drops from the rafters
Firmin and André plead for calm as the Phantom s diabolical laughter is heard

In the ensuing chaos Christine escapes with Raoul to the roof where she tells him about her subterranean rendezvous with the Phantom
Raoul is skeptical telling her that what she experienced was just a dream

Seeing Christine s fear is real he swears to love and to protect her always
They acknowledge their love for each other as Christine and Raoul return to the Opera House
The Phantom who has overheard their conversation is heartbroken and accuses Christine of denying and betraying him
He tearfully rues that Raoul was bound to love you when he heard you sing
As Raoul and Christine s expression of love for each other reverberates through the rooftops he angrily vows revenge destroying the Opéra s mighty chandelier with a massive explosion as the curtain falls

Act II Six months later in the midst of a splendid masquerade ball the Phantom costumed as the Red Death makes his first appearance since the chandelier disaster
He announces to the stunned guests that he has written an opera entitled Don Juan Triumphant
He demands that it be produced immediately with Christine as the lead female role and threatens dire consequences if his instructions are not implicitly obeyed before vanishing in a ghostly flash of fire and smoke
Raoul demands that Madame Giry tell him about the Phantom
She reluctantly replies that he is a brilliant musician and magician born with a terrifyingly deformed face who escaped from captivity in a travelling freak show and disappeared
During rehearsals Raoul tired of the tyranny with which the Phantom rules the Opera thinks to use the première of Don Juan Triumphant as a trap to capture the Phantom and put an end to his reign of terror once and for all
Carlotta falsely accuses Christine of being the mastermind and that it is her plan so she can be the star
Christine angrily defends herself saying that it is not true
Carlotta storms out in rage
Raoul knowing of the Phantom s obsession with his fiancée asserts that the Phantom will be sure to attend
Christine torn between her love for Raoul and her fear of the Phantom visits her father s grave longing for his guidance but understanding that she must move on
The Phantom appears once again under the guise of the Angel of Music
Christine tired and heartbroken once again accepts her Angel as a friend nearly succumbing to the Phantom s influence but Raoul arrives to both rescue her and confront The Phantom
The Phantom taunts Raoul magically summoning pillars of fire at them and causing them to flee
Furious the Phantom sets fire to the cemetery waging war upon them both
Don Juan Triumphant opens with Christine and Piangi singing the lead roles
During Don Juan s and Aminta s duet Christine comes to the sudden realization that she is singing not with Piangi but with the Phantom himself
Mimicking Raoul s vow of devotion on the rooftop the Phantom once again expresses love for Christine and slips his ring onto her finger Christine rips off his mask exposing his horrifically deformed face to the shocked audience
Chaos ensues
Piangi s garroted body is revealed backstage the cast and audience fly into a state of panic and the Phantom seizes Christine and flees the theatre
An angry mob vowing vengeance for murder Buquet and Piangi searches the theatre for the Phantom while Madame Giry tells Raoul how to find the Phantom s subterranean lair and warns him to beware his magical lasso
In the lair Christine is forced to don a wedding dress
Raoul finds the lair and attempts to persuade the Phantom to spare Christine begging him to show compassion
The Phantom refuses stating that the world showed no compassion to me and claiming that his intention was never to hurt Christine for Raoul s sins
The Phantom captures Raoul with his lasso and turns to Christine he bargains that he will free Raoul if she agrees to stay with him forever if she refuses Raoul will die
Christine heartbroken tells the Phantom that it is his soul that is deformed not his face
As the Phantom and Raoul both plead to her Christine mournfully wonders what kind of life the Phantom has known
She tells the Phantom that he is not alone and kisses him showing him compassion
The Phantom having experienced kindness at last understands that he cannot compel Christine to love him
He sets them both free telling them to forget about this angel in hell
Christine returns the Phantom s ring to him and he tells her he loves her
Christine exits with Raoul
Lamenting that without Christine it s over now the music of the night the Phantom makes his way to his throne and covers himself with his cloak
Meg enters the Phantom s lair and pulls away the cloak finding only the Phantom s mask
She holds the Phantom s mask up and looks out to the audience as the lights fade to black

In an alternate timeline dinosaurs have managed to survive the KT Extinction Event and now live amongst humans using disguises
Vincent Rubio is a Velociraptor private investigator along with his partner Ernie Watson a Triceratops
When Ernie s ex girlfriend s brother is found dead the incident is dismissed as suicide
However she doesn t believe her brother would kill himself and asks Ernie to investigate
When the pair investigate the crime scene Vincent notices the scent of another dinosaur on the windowsill concluding it was not a suicide
At the funeral Vincent talks to a man dressed in a strange suit who belongs to the cult that the deceased had previously joined The Voice of Progress
He pretends to be interested in their ideals and gets himself and Ernie invited to a gathering
During the funeral Vincent detects the same scent from the victim s bedroom indicating the killer is nearby
Vincent and Ernie go to the cult meeting where they are told the Voice of Progress ideals and history The Voice of Progress is revealed to be a collection of dinosaurs who believe that the prolonged use of disguises has robbed the dinosaur community of its unique identity
The cult also believes that humans have caused dinosaurs to see themselves as monsters and humans as normal
While Ernie appears indifferent to the cult s ideals Vincent is profoundly impacted by the cult s beliefs
As their investigation continues Vincent and Ernie come to realize what one man in the cult is planning a dinosaurian revolution by turning cult members into violent feral dinosaurs and releasing them on the humans
The resulting conflict will force both sides to face each other and allow dinosaurs to reveal themselves
Though Vincent is somewhat sympathetic to the cult he disagrees with the idea of a violent revolution leaving him unsure which side he s on

The film opens on two young children whose mother is dying in the present day Gimli Manitoba hospital
During a visit to see her the children s Icelandic grandmother launches into the grim and convoluted tale of Einar the Lonely a patient in a far distant past version of the same hospital in a Gimli we no longer know as the grandmother puts it
The rest of the film consists of Einar s story
Einar succumbs to a smallpox epidemic and is admitted to the Gimli hospital for treatment where he meets his neighbor Gunnar
While both are at first pleased to have a friend nearby in their time of illness the two men soon begin competing for the attentions and affections of the hospital s beautiful young nurses
Gunnar outperforms Einar in this regard given his storytelling abilities and his skill at carving birch bark into the shape of fish
The hospital is built above a stable and director Maddin appears in a cameo as a surgeon who operates while patients are told to observe a badly acted puppet show as a sort of anesthesia
Gunnar borrows Einar s fish carving shears and recognizes the decorated pair of shears as uncannily similar to those he buried with his wife Snj√≥fridur
Gunnar recalls the story of their courtship and her death from smallpox she contracted from Gunnar
His aboriginal friend despite Gunnar s protests then laid her body to rest in the traditional aboriginal manner on a raised platform with tokens and gifts including the shears
Einar relates to Gunnar the story of how he came to possess the shears while wandering in the dark one night he discovered the corpse of a beautiful woman on a raised burial platform
Einar stole the tokens buried with her and had sex with her corpse
Gunnar is furious but too weak to take immediate revenge on Einar and coincidentally a fire breaks out on the hospital roof
The Icelanders put out the fire by pouring milk over it which then drips down into Gunnar s face and blinds him
A blackfaced minstrel is buried and Einar contemplates further destroying Gunnar through carving him up with the selfsame shears stolen from his wife s corpse
Einar and Gunnar exit the hospital and wander around feverishly
Einar observes Lord Dufferin giving a public speech
Einar hallucinates that Lord Dufferin is the mythical Fish Princess
The men end up in a field together along with a Shriners Highland Pipe Band and begin to Glima Wrestle a traditional competition where fighters graps each other s buttocks and take turns lifting one another up until one collapses
They tear each other s clothes and claw at each other s buttocks until they bleed then both collapse
Einar is later back in his small shack fish smokehouse and is visited by a recovered and no longer blind Gunnar and his new fiance
They happily saunter along the beach of Lake Winnipeg while Einar regards them jealously still Einar the Lonely
The scene returns to the present day Gimli where the children are informed that their mother has died
They ask the storytelling Amma to be their mother and she says no but that she will still visit if your father lets me
They ask about heaven and she prepares to tell another story as the film ends

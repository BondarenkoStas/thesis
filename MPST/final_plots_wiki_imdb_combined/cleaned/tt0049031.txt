A deputy marshall kills a ranch hand and steals a sack of gold
He claims it was a fair fight but the marshal of Arizona s Southern Territory has his doubts
Unknown to Smeed there was a witness to the murder
While the investigation unfolds Smeed tries to cover up the evidence and eliminate people who can implicate him
Another deputy who has always admired Smeed defends him to his girlfriend but is astonished when Alvarado translates the written eyewitness account by Nachez
Smeed kidnaps Nachez taking him to a mine where he kills him and hides the body
Gentry shows up at the mine but is over powered by Smeed tied up and left to be buried in a cave in caused by Smeed setting a charge
The marshal arrives with his posse and hunts down Smeed inside the mine using an alternate entry
In the meantime Gentry who survives the cave in unties himself and joins the hunt
The posse corners Smeed who draws first and is killed by Gentry
In the closing scene Gentry is presented with a new badge by Forrester and congratulated for being appointed to the position of marshal of Arizona s Northern Territory

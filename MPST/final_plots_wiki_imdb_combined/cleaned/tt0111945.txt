Season 1 The first season s opening credits consisted of a caricature of Carey consisting of his face and a yellow tie singing the Robert McGuire penned Moon Over Parma
The song was trimmed for the opening sequence and the reference to Eastlake in the line Guide her to Eastlake underneath your silvery light was changed to a reference to Cleveland to stay in theme with the show
In the first season Drew and Mimi worked under Mr Bell who existed only as a voice on Drew s speakerphone excluding the season finale wherein he is fired by Winfred Louder s new owners
Other characters that appeared exclusively in this period were Drew s hillbilly neighbor Jules and his family
Drew s first girlfriend Lisa was introduced in this season as was Jay Kate s love interest who used to attend the same high school as Drew and his friends
Both characters lasted until Season 2 where they were quickly written out of the show in the early episodes
Nine of the episode titles were related to chemistry in some way with names such as The Joining of Two Unlike Elements Is a Mixture and Isomers Have Distinct Characteristics
However this theme was abandoned by the end of the season
Seasons 2 7 Moon Over Parma was phased out during the second season by Five O Clock World sung by The Vogues
This season introduced openings that paid homage to music videos which included the cast dancing and singing around the various sets of the show
In the third season yet another change was made to Cleveland Rocks a cover of an Ian Hunter song performed by The Presidents of the United States of America
This change lasted until the second wave of the show ended with the finale of Season 7
The man who took over Mr Bell s job after his firing was Nigel Wick who served as a foil for both Drew and Mimi in the workplace
During this period Drew and Mr Wick also periodically took the top management job away from each other
This would usually result in Drew ending up back at his old job as Assistant Director of Personnel and Mr Wick would miraculously retain his job as manager
By the end of Season 7 they were both Co Managers before Winfred Louder was closed down
Kate and Oswald became closer and eventually became romantically involved and almost married during the third season but Kate stood Oswald up at the altar
Kate and Drew also became romantically involved and were on the verge of getting married but they called it off when they realized they didn t feel the same about the prospect of children
Drew s cross dressing brother Steve was introduced during this period
He eventually fell in love with Mimi and they had a child together Gus
Drew also got married a number of times during this portion of the show
His first marriage was to Diane a cocktail waitress in Las Vegas
This was only temporary however as she needed Drew to retain custody of her children
His second marriage was to Mr Wick who forced Drew to marry him in a sham same sex civil union in Vermont in hopes that the marriage would placate the Immigration and Naturalization Service
At the beginning of Season 7 Drew married both Nikki and Kate
They found out about this and all three of these marriages ended in divorce and Drew became known as the Impotent Bisexual Bigamist
Nikki eventually returned and the actress Kate Walsh donned a fat suit again and moved in with Drew
During this period the show also had frequent event episodes
Recurring themes were What s Wrong With This Episode
in which the show contained numerous deliberate continuity errors and other mistakes and invited viewers at home to find the most errors and win a prize and live episodes with loose plots and improvised scenes featuring cast members from Carey s improvisational comedy show Whose Line Is It Anyway
contributed to these episodes with Brad Sherwood hosting
Seasons 8 9 Beginning in season 8 the show rotated through 9 different opening sequences each of which contained a new version of one of the show s three theme songs
Each theme was seen in three different segments in new wildly different arrangements
The show eventually went back to having just five main characters akin to the first season as Kate Mr Wick and Steve were eventually written out of the show
Kate s character was married off Mr Wick disappeared after three appearances until the Season 8 finale wherein it is revealed he became a weatherman Steve left at the beginning of the ninth season to find himself
With Winfred Louder closed the location became the office of online retailer Neverending Store
Drew Mimi and Mr Wick were hired as employees of the new company
Mimi was hired first in a similar role to her old job and Drew was eventually hired as Internal Expediting Analyst and a recurring gag began wherein Drew had no clue as to what his job entailed
Before being written out Mr Wick was at first a janitor and another recurring joke came in the form of Mr Wick attempting to climb the ladder back to being the boss
Before being written out he went from janitor to the carrier of the dessert trolley
Kate left after the first two episodes of season 8 the same two episodes that introduced Kellie an old high school friend of Drew s who had been working as a stripper
She eventually became a waitress at The Warsaw Tavern Drew s girlfriend and the carrier of his child
The plot of the final episode was Drew and Kellie attempting to get married before their child is born
Mr Wick also returned and stayed on for the series finale
The show began featuring cameos from reality TV participants in the final two seasons such as former Road Rules star Timmy Beggy The Real World alumna Cara Khan and The Amazing Race winner Reichen Lehmkuhl
Tony the Bus Driver became a regular serving as smart alecky bartender type to whom Drew could tell his problems
The eighth season was put in a timeslot that frequently clashed with Monday Night Football
It was pulled mid season and the remaining episodes were shown during the summer of 2003
The ninth season did not air until the summer of 2004 with most of the episodes out of order
The last season s tone changed radically from the previous seasons
The directors began experimenting with one camera set ups showing the sets completely built with four walls in most rooms and with rooms actually linked together
The writers also began experimenting including story lines in which Gus burns down Mimi s house forcing her to move in with Drew after Steve leaves her

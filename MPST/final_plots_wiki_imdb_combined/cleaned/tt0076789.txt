The plot reminiscent of the Alfred Hitchcock film Strangers on a Train focuses on two disparate characters
Conservative Henry Bell has been eased out of his job by condescending Bruce Tick while wealthy and wildly eccentric Karen Knightly has been abandoned by her lover Anthony Staxton Billing who opted to return to his wife Imogen
Both are intent on committing suicide by leaping from the Tower Bridge in London
When neither succeeds they strike a bargain whereby each agrees to exact revenge on behalf of the other although Henry is less enthusiastic about the plan
Karen disguised as a frumpy office temp finds employment as an assistant to Tick and quickly derails his marriage by leading his wife Hilary to believe he s involved in an extramarital affair
Henry meanwhile is finding it difficult to keep his end of the bargain since he has fallen in love with Imogen the object of Karen s revenge
Instead of planning her demise he begins an affair with the beguiling woman
Henry learns that Anthony left Karen not for Imogen but for beautician Daphne Teal and he begins to suspect Karen is more of a villain than a victim
The woman proves to be a formidable foe when she realizes Henry may renege on their deal
Adding to the humorous complications are Karen s oddball brother Oliver who delights in racing through the interior of their rural mansion on his motor scooter elderly and slightly befuddled housekeeper Winnie and Daphne s very inept daughter Norma who s being groomed to take over the household chores so Winnie finally can retire

Kenneth Zevo the owner of the Zevo Toy factory in Moscow Idaho is dying
He tells his assistant Owen Owens of his desire for the factory to be given to his brother Lt Gen Leland Zevo instead of his son Leslie
Even Leland is unsure of this pointing out how Leslie has been apprenticed at the toy factory most of his life
Kenneth agrees Leslie loves toys and his work but his childlike demeanor would not help him to be a successful business leader
Kenneth had even gone to lengths to hire Gwen Tyler as a factory worker believing Leslie would become attracted to her and she would help him to mature
Kenneth passes away and Leland reluctantly takes control of the factory
Leland who still aspires to meet his father s demands to be a 4 star General allows Leslie and his childlike sister Alsatia continue designing new toys
However Leland s interest is piqued when he hears about corporate secrets being leaked and he hires his son Patrick a soldier with covert military expertise to manage security
From Patrick Leland gets the idea of building war toys in the factory
Leslie points out that Zevo Toys has never made war toys
Leland offers to drop the idea but asks Leslie if he can portion off a small amount of the factory to develop toys of his own
He asks Leslie to stay out of the area for fear that his toys may not be good enough
Unknown to Leslie Leland is using the space to develop miniature war machines that can be controlled remotely aspiring to sell these to the military
However the military leaders refuse to buy into his plan and Leland becoming unhinged by their refusal moves ahead with his plan independently
He takes over more and more of the factory space and increases security on these areas
When Leslie sees children being led into one of Leland s secure areas he finds a way to sneak into the space
Inside he discovers Leland training the children to operate the miniature war machines with arcade like interfaces so the children would not be aware they are actually operating real war equipment
Leslie flees before he is discovered barely escaping the Sea Swine amphibious drone guarding an exit and makes his way to Gwen s house to reveal what he saw
Leslie is unaware that Leland has seen his actions through spy toys monitoring the area and prepares to defend his parts of the factory becoming more demented and promoting himself to general of his own army
Patrick learns that Leland lied about the death of his mother and quits to warn Leslie
Leslie Alsatia Patrick Gwen and Owen go to the factory to fight against Leland using the Zevo toys against Leland s war machines
Leslie manages to escape and disable Leland s control system for the toys
As Leslie and Patrick confront Leland Alsatia is attacked by the Sea Swine but she is revealed to be a robot built by Kenneth to be a companion for Leslie
As Leslie and Patrick tend to Alsatia Leland tries to escape but the Sea Swine stops and attacks him
As Leland is hospitalized Leslie takes control of the factory and continues his relationship with Gwen while Alsatia is repaired
Patrick prepares to leave to take on further missions but remains with Leslie and his friends long enough to attend a brief memorial to Kenneth

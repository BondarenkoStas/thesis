A family of little people are peacefully having dinner when the thundering sound of horsemen is heard
One of the male adults helps the other family members to hide but with nowhere else in the house to hide he jumps out a window and flees only to be ridden down by a horsemen captured and kidnapped to a foreign kingdom
He is dragged before a royal court of monsters consisting of the monstrously fat king and his equally repulsive court called Hop Frog because of his now limping gait and forced to become the new jester One morning the practical joke obsessed king orders the inventive yet sensitive Hop Frog to provide entertainment for the arriving Duke and Duchess of Siri Siril
Following Hop frog s physical comedy and a sumptuous banquet the king s guests wheel in a giant bird cage containing a young dwarfish woman named Tripetta as a gift for the king
It s love at first sight for Hop Frog but his feelings and the condescending and cruel treatment at the hands of the so called normal courtiers only tortures him even more
Events take an even uglier turn when the king summons Hop Frog orders him to come up with a original idea for an upcoming costume ball and forces him to drink goblets of wine
Trippetta who has been forced to be present tries to halt the bullying but has a goblet of wine thrown in her face for her efforts
This in turn has the effect of immediately sobering Hop Frog up and he comes up with a brilliant idea the king and his councillors will be covered in fur and pretend to be ourangutangs bound together by a lengthy chain and most appealing to the King s sadistic nature scare the you know what out of everybody
The conceit is a strange one but the King and his men readily accept it
Later that night Hop frog frees Trippetta from her cage to assist him in carrying out his plans for the costume ball The night of the ball arrives and the plan is carried out the king and his councillors are sewn into tight fitting body suits and equipped with carved wooden masks
The illusion is a flawless one so much so that when the Eight Chained Ourangutangs bust into the party at midnight and create their commotion none of the guests complain when Hop Frog lowers a chandelier chain down from the ceiling hooks it to the chain connecting the beasts and has it and the apes hoisted into the air
Using a torch to pretend to try and find out who these costumed people are he sets them all afire with the other partygoers too far out of reach to help
He and Trippetta watch coldly from the roof as the fire claims its victims then escape into the air on a makeshift flying machine as flames slowly spread through the kingdom

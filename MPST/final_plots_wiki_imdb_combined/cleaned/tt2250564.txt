Eka and Natia are two fourteen year old best friends living in Tbilisi in 1992 after Zviad Gamsakhurdia was deposed of and during the Georgian Civil War
Natia is the more vivacious of the two girls though she has a rough home life due to her alcoholic abusive father
Eka lives with her older sister and mother while her father is in prison
Natia has two boys who are interested in her Kote and Lado
Lado tells her that he is going to Moscow to visit his uncle but before he leaves he gifts her a gun with a single bullet
Natia is impressed with the gift believing it is Lado s way of taking care of her
After witnessing Eka being bullied on her way home by two boys Natia forces the gun on her and tells her to use it to intimidate the boys as violence is the only language they understand
However walking home Eka sees two boys beating up Kopla the main boy that bullies her
Initially intending to ignore the situation she ends up pulling out the gun and successfully using it to threaten the boys beating up Kopla
Standing in line waiting for bread some time later Natia is grabbed by Kote and pulled into a car with his friends
Though Eka tries to help her she is ultimately unsuccessful
She then turns on the adults in the line who have done nothing to stop Natia s kidnapping and swears at them until one of the men strikes her down
Eka attends Natia s wedding though she is unhappy for her friend
She gives the gun back to Natia without telling her about her interaction with Kopla
Natia s initial hesitant happiness in her marriage quickly dissolves
Visited by Eka she confesses to missing school and being disappointed at living with her husband s family who are restrictive and don t want her to see her old friends
After they quash plans for a birthday party Natia ends up sneaking out and spending the day with Eka at her grandmother s house where she also sees Lado
She is caught by her husband Kote who jealously takes her away
Later he fathers up a group of his friends and attacks Lado culminating in Lado being stabbed and killed
Hearing of the murder Natia becomes incensed and goes to get the gun but Eka beats her to her house and keeps it from her long enough to calm her down and prevent her from going to kill Kote
The two end up going to a pond where Eka throws the gun in the water
Later Eka who has always refused to go and see her father who is residing in jail goes to see him by herself

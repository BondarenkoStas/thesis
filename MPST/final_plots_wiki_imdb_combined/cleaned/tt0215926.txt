Refusing to sacrifice himself to restore the Pillars he doomed Nosgoth to eternal decay and proceeded to raise his vampire lieutenants including Raziel to besiege the land
By the time of Soul Reaver s introduction the vampires are now the land s dominant species and apex predators the humans have been decimated and the vampire tribes have each claimed a region of Nosgoth and turned their attention to internal matters
Unknown to the vampires beneath Nosgoth lurks The Elder God an ancient and powerful entity
The Elder God controls the Wheel of Fate a cycle of reincarnation of souls that circle the Wheel in a loop of predestination however because vampires are immortal their souls do not spin with the Wheel causing the land to decay as the Wheel stalls
By the time that Raziel is revived centuries after the game s opening cinematic Nosgoth is on the brink of collapse little more than a wasteland wracked with cataclysms and earthquakes

Raziel kills Zephon and uses the gained power to infiltrate an ancient crypt
There Raziel discovers coffins for members of the Sarafan a fanatical order of vampire hunters killed centuries before Kain s rule
To Raziel s horror he finds the crypt was designated for him and his brothers as cruel irony Kain revived the Sarafan to serve him as his vampire sons

Raziel traverses the caves and finds Kain in the Chronoplast s control room
Raziel is angered over what he has learned and Kain says his actions are justified due to his being subject to destiny before proceeding to inform Raziel that the Sarafan were far from the noble crusaders that Raziel believes them to be when the latter demands to know why he created him which Raziel refuses to listen to

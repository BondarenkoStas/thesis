M Hulot is the dreamy impractical and adored uncle of nine year old Gérard Arpel who lives with his materialistic parents M and Mme
Arpel in an ultra modern geometric house and garden Villa Arpel in a new suburb of Paris situated just beyond the crumbling stone buildings of the old neighborhoods of the city
Gérard s parents are entrenched in a machine like existence of work fixed gender roles the acquisition of status through possessions and conspicuous displays to impress guests such as the fish shaped fountain at the center of the garden that in a running gag Mme
Arpel activates only for important visitors
Each element of Villa Arpel is stylistically rather than functionally designed creating an environment completely indifferent to the comfort or lack of comfort of its occupants
In choosing modern architecture to punctuate his satire Tati once stated Les lignes géométriques ne rendent pas les gens aimables
From inconveniently located stepping stones to difficult to sit on furniture to a kitchen filled with deafeningly loud appliances every facet of Villa Arpel emphasizes the impracticality of a dedication to superficial aesthetics and electrical gadgets over the necessities of daily living
Despite the superficial beauty of its modern design the Arpels home is entirely impersonal as are the Arpels themselves
In fact M and Mme
Arpel have completely subordinated their individuality to maintain their social position and their shiny new possessions
Tati emphasizes his themes surrounding the Arpel lifestyle with monochromatic shades and cloudy days
By contrast Monsieur Hulot lives in an old and run down city district
He is unemployed and gets around town either on foot or on a VéloSoleX motorized bicycle
Gérard utterly bored by the sterility and monotony of his life with his parents fastens himself to his uncle at every opportunity
Hulot little more than a child himself at times is completely at home with Gérard but also completely ineffectual at controlling his horseplay with his school friends who take delight in tormenting adults with practical jokes
Exasperated at their relative s perceived immaturity the Arpels soon scheme to saddle him with the twin yokes of family and business responsibilities

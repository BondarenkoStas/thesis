In the film s prologue a hotelier ushers a child into a bomb shelter during the Liverpool Blitz
We see a brief flashback to a woman leaving her baby in a basement surrounded by flickering candles
Before departing from the house she quickly drops a string of pearls on the child s pillow twined around a single rose
Years later 16 year old Stella Bradshaw lives in a working class household with her Uncle Vernon and Aunt Lily in Liverpool
Lacking an adult in her life to whom she feels close she frequently goes into phone booths to speak with her mother who never appears in the film
Her uncle who sees a theatrical career as being her only alternative to working behind the counter at Woolworth s signs her up for speech lessons and pulls the strings to get her involved at a local repertory theatre
After an unsuccessful audition Stella gets a job gofering for Meredith Potter the troupe s sleazy eccentric director and Bunny his faithful stage manager
The impressionable Stella develops a crush on the worldly self absorbed Potter whose homosexuality completely eludes her
Amused he gives her the small role of Ptolemy the boy king in Caesar and Cleopatra but ignores her otherwise
Potter reveals himself to be a remorseless apathetic man who treats Stella and everyone else around him with scorn and condescension
He reserves his greatest cruelty for Dawn Allenby a desperate older actress whom he callously dismisses from the company she later attempts suicide
Potter also has a long history of exploiting young men
Stella is quickly caught up in the backstage intrigue and also becomes an object of sexual advances for men around the theatre company including P L O Hara a brilliant actor who has returned to the troupe in a stint playing Captain Hook for its Christmas production of Peter Pan
In keeping with theatrical tradition O Hara also doubles as Mr
Darling
O Hara carries himself with grace and charisma but privately is as troubled and disillusioned as the other members of the cast
Haunted by his wartime experiences and a lost love O Hara embarks on an affair with Stella to whom he feels an inexplicably deep emotional connection
Stella who is still determined to win over Potter remains emotionally detached but takes advantage of O Hara s affections seeing it as an opportunity to gain sexual experience
The last straw for Stella is during a cast outing when Geoffrey a fellow teenage stagehand whom Potter has been sexually toying with bursts out and headbutts him in the nose
The cast rushes to comfort Geoffrey but Stella exclaims that he ought to be sacked
O Hara explains to her that Potter has spent his life harming people like Geoffrey and causing pain to people like Bunny who really love him believe it or not it doesn t much matter him or her old or young to Meredith
What he wants is hearts
Concerned O Hara visits her aunt and uncle who disclose Stella s history
He finds out that Stella s long missing mother was his lost love whom he then knew by the nickname Stella Maris making Stella whom he s been sleeping with his child a daughter rather than the son he had imagined
Keeping his discovery to himself O Hara gets on his motorcycle and drives back out to the seaport
He distractedly slips on the wet gangplank hits his head and is pitched into the water
Before he drowns his last image is that of the woman from the earlier flashbacks clutching the infant
Stella is later seen hastening to the phone booth to confide her woes over the phone to her mother as has been her habit throughout the film
We are suddenly reminded that the absent Stella Maris had years ago won a nationwide contest to be the voice of the speaking clock
It is her recorded voice that provides the only response to her daughter s confidences

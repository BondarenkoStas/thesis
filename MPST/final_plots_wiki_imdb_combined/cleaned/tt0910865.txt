In Kathmandu Nepal the sorcerer Kaecilius and his zealots enter the secret compound Kamar Taj and behead its librarian
They steal a few pages from an ancient mystical text belonging to the Ancient One a long lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar Taj including Kaecilius in the mystic arts
The Ancient One pursues the traitors but Kaecilius and his followers escape
In New York City Stephen Strange an acclaimed but arrogant neurosurgeon badly injures his hands in a car accident leaving him unable to operate
Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer tries to help him move on but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands
Strange eventually learns of Jonathan Pangborn a paraplegic who mysteriously regained full use of his legs
Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar Taj where he is taken in by Mordo a sorcerer under the Ancient One
The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension
She eventually agrees to train Strange despite his arrogance which remind her of Kaecilius
Strange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo and from ancient books in the library that is now guarded by the master Wong
Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called Sanctums in New York City London and Hong Kong which are all connected and accessible from Kamar Taj
The sorcerers task is to protect the Sanctums though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy into just walking again
Strange progresses quickly and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto
Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature drawing a comparison to Kaecilius desire for eternal life
Kaecilius uses the stolen pages to contact the powerful Dormammu of the Dark Dimension where time is non existent
Kaecilius destroys the London Sanctum to weaken Earth s protection
The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum killing its guardian but Strange holds them off with the help of the Cloak of Levitation until Mordo and the Ancient One arrive
Strange and Mordo become disillusioned with the Ancient One after Kaecilius reveals that the Ancient One s long life is due to her drawing power from the Dark Dimension
Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong
Before dying she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement Mordo s steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius
Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead the Sanctum destroyed and the Dark Dimension irresistibly engulfing Earth
Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong then creates an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment of time
After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail Dormammu finally gives in to Strange s demand that he leave Earth and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the time loop
Disgusted by Strange and the Ancient One defying nature s laws Mordo departs

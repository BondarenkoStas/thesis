Sipowicz is the elder partner but is an alcoholic who drinks on the job as well as off duty and his behavior causes doubt that the partnership will last much longer
Kelly has a genuine affection for his partner but becomes increasingly exasperated by Sipowicz s behavior
In addition to his alcoholism Sipowicz is a deeply negative misogynist homophobic bigot
In the pilot Sipowicz is shot by a suspect he had attacked and humiliated earlier
This leads to his decision to sober up and save his job
While Sipowicz is recuperating the squad s lieutenant Arthur Fancy teams Kelly with a young cop from Anti Crime James Martinez
Kelly s personal life is as frenetic as his professional life
He is reluctantly going through a divorce from his wife Laura and is embarking on an affair with a uniformed cop Janice Licalsi
To complicate matters further Licalsi s police officer father is on the payroll of mob boss Angelo Marino
Licalsi in an attempt to protect her father has been ordered to do a hit on Kelly
Instead Licalsi murders Marino and the repercussions come back to haunt both her and Kelly
Sipowicz meanwhile sobers up and begins a relationship with ADA Sylvia Costas
The other detective in the squad Greg Medavoy a married man embarks on an affair with the squad s new administrative aide Donna Abandando
Season 2 Licalsi is found guilty of the manslaughter of Marino and his driver and is given a two year sentence
Because of Kelly s involvement with Licalsi and the widely held belief that he withheld evidence that could have given her a longer sentence he is transferred out of the 15th and chooses to leave the department altogether
He is replaced by Bobby Simone a widower whose previous job was that of driver for the Police Commissioner
This does not sit well with Sipowicz but after learning that Simone took the assignment in order to be present for his wife who was suffering from cancer Sipowicz learns to accept his new partner and eventually builds a strong friendship with him

Sipowicz as a recovering alcoholic recognizes from Russell s behavior that she also has a drinking problem
After much prompting she begins attending Alcoholics Anonymous
In another storyline due to his low self esteem and disbelief that a woman like Donna could love him Medavoy s relationship with her breaks down due in no small part to Donna s visiting sister
Season 3 At the beginning of the season Sylvia becomes pregnant with Andy s child
A baby boy Theo is born towards the end of the season
This is contrasted with the fate that awaits Sipowicz s older son Andy Jr who announces that he plans to join the police force in nearby Hackensack New Jersey after being discharged from the Air Force due to an injury
Sipowicz is finally bonding with his long estranged son when Andy Jr is gunned down trying to help people in a bar holdup
This causes the elder Sipowicz to fall off the wagon
Simone kills Andy Jr s murderers in an act of self defense while attempting to arrest them
Bobby and Diane who had placed their relationship on hold while she attended AA resume seeing each other
Diane begins drinking again when her abusive father beats her mother
Her father is eventually killed and her mother becomes the prime suspect
James Martinez and new detective Adrienne Lesniak begin an affair but Lesniak later breaks it off and tells Medavoy that she is gay because her last relationship with a fellow cop ended disastrously
After James is shot recovers and returns to work and he and Lesniak get to know each other she admits that the story she told Medavoy was a lie
Martinez later breaks up with her due to her controlling and unpleasant behavior and Lesniak eventually leaves the squad

Danny Sorenson
Two additional critical incidents occur during Season 6 the heroin overdose death of PAA Dolores Mayo and the death of Costas who is accidentally gunned down by Mayo s distraught father at the courthouse trial of the suspect accused in Mayo s death
Costas s final words to Sipowicz lead to his initial withdrawal from the squad
Yet his keen perceptiveness allows him to gain a confession from the accused suspect who tried to buy his way out of trouble
Furthermore Sipowicz reaches a level of understanding with PAA John Irvin whose homosexuality had been a stumbling block for Sipowicz in their interactions to that point

Season 9 also sees the introduction of Det

Sipowicz is awarded promotion to Detective First Grade for the same arrest that results in Clark Jr receiving his detective s shield though Sipowicz had been recommended for First Grade at the same time as Simone for their work on a high profile case several years earlier the promotion had been withheld from Sipowicz because of negative incidents earlier in his career
The remaining four years saw a continuing focus on Sipowicz as the main character as had been the case since Simone s death
Another unlikely romance developed between Sipowicz and Connie McDowell

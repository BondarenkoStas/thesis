Tiny a dog trainer hides with his dogs in a wicker basket on the stage of an abandoned vaudeville theater
He emerges to have them practice a trick attacking a tattered straw boater hat on command
When a second man Arnold Hugh emerges menacingly onto the stage Tiny fearfully backs away from him and falls into the orchestra pit getting his clothes snagged on a broken plank
Years earlier Tiny had found one of his dogs missing while performing his trained dog act in the theater
Even though he fears that the crowd no longer likes the act his friend Daphne encourages him to go on with the show
He is booed off the stage in favor of a silent movie which stars Arnold and Daphne and features the missing dog taken by Daphne
Arnold pressures her not to tell Tiny about the theft and goes on to make a string of successful movies with Daphne and the dogs
Tiny trains the dogs to jump up and place a boater on his head at his command
When Arnold uses this trick in one of his movies though it fails because he is taller than Tiny he angrily confronts Tiny and threatens to torture the animals unless they can reach his height
Angered Tiny re trains them to attack instead prompting Arnold to leave the studio for the confrontation seen at the beginning of the film
Daphne decides that she no longer wants to work with Arnold and follows him to the theater
Daphne swings a sandbag across the stage knocking Arnold down and confesses her involvement to Tiny
Arnold gets up and begins to strangle Daphne but Tiny delivers his attack command and the dogs advance menacingly toward him
Arnold pulls a metal latch off the wall to use as a weapon triggering the movie screen to come down on his head and kill him
Daphne sees no sign of Tiny when she turns back to the orchestra pit but he is lifted into view on the organ that had been used to provide background music for Arnold s movies
It now glows white being played by a spectral organist Tiny climbs off unhurt but Arnold s spirit rises from his body and steps on at the organist s beckoning
The organ swiftly drops out of sight carrying a terrified Arnold down to hell
As the theater begins to collapse Daphne persuades Tiny to overcome his fear of rejection and leave with her
They and the dogs exit into the light of the outside world

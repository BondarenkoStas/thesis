The story opens at a fabric dyeing mill
The quality of the dyes has noticeably worsened and the factory owner Wang and his subordinate chief Boss Wa decide to hire some Manchu overseers to improve the work
Wang decides to cut the workers salary to pay the mercenaries and when the workers protest they are viciously thrashed
When sitting in a tea house discussing their problems the workers are joined by Chu Jen chieh a good hearted small time con man and the foreman s younger brother who is posing as a monk
He offers to help but since he cannot actually do kung fu he and the foreman s assistant Ah Chao devise a plan to trick the Manchu into reinstating the full salary pay with Jen chieh posing as the Shaolin s head abbot San Te
At first the scheme works but Wang quickly works out that this man is an impostor and has him driven away and his Manchu hirelings retaliate against the workers
Feeling guilty about what has happened Jen chieh leaves and heads for the Shaolin temple to learn the real fighting arts
His first attempts to enter by stealth are thwarted by the vigilant monks and his own bumbling but eventually he manages to sneak his way in just to run into the abbot San Te
He too realizes that Jen chieh is not what he claims to be but he announces that he wants to give him a chance Jen chieh is to build a set of scaffolds all around the temple and renovate the entire complex
Somewhat reluctantly Jen chieh goes to work but he is constantly distracted by the monks practicing martial arts in the 36th Chamber which he can overlook from his high vantage point
Eventually he begins to train himself in kung fu by using the conditions of his assignment to improvise training facilities
However this causes him to lag behind in his work and it takes him more than a year to finish the gantry
As soon as Jen chieh announces that he is finished San Te wants him to dismantle the structure and leave the monastery
Rebelling against this decision Jen chieh lands himself inside the chamber and while trying to evade the abbot chasing him he inadvertently manages to pass all hazards set in the chamber with ease
San Te finally corners him and forces him to leave with a strange smile on his lips
Jen chieh returns to town to find that the conditions of the workers have worsened Their salary has been cut by nearly half and any who have protested had been laid off to eke out a meager existence
Elated by his return some of the ex workers begin to pester Jen chieh with their high expectations which leads to Jen chieh instinctively and to his own surprise fighting them off with his newly acquired kung fu skills
The next morning Jen chieh appears at the dye mill and thrashes the overseers using bamboo fibers to tie them up and incapacitate them introducing his style as scaffolding kung fu
Once the overseers are dealt with Wang and his bodyguards appear at the scene
Jen chieh lures them out of the city to a mansion under construction where he uses the building equipment and the tight quarters to his advantage
Finally overpowering Wang he forces him to pay his workers their full wages again
Wang admits defeat and Jen chieh continues his training on the half finished grounds

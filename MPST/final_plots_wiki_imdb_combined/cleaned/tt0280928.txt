In the year 1286 an evil sorcerer named Zarok plotted to take over the kingdom of Gallowmere with his undead army
It is told in legend that the champion Sir Daniel Fortesque led the King of Gallowmere s army to victory and managed to kill Zarok before he succumbed to his mortal wounds
In reality however Dan was in fact struck down by the first arrow fired in the battle with the king choosing to cover it up and declare Dan the Hero of Gallowmere
Zarok meanwhile was forced into hiding and was presumed dead
100 years later in 1386 Zarok reappears casting a spell over Gallowmere to awaken his undead army and steal the souls of the living
However in the process he unwittingly revives the corpse of Dan who has over time become a skeletal corpse missing his jaw and the eye he lost in the battle of Gallowmere
Having been unable to ascend to the Hall of Heroes due to his failures in life Dan uses this opportunity to defeat Zarok save Gallowmere and earn his place as a true hero
As Dan travels across Gallowmere fighting his way through Zarok s hordes and confronting all manners of beasts he soon arrives at Zarok s lair fighting off Zarok s skeletal warriors using the souls of his old allies retrieved by collecting the Chalices
After also managing to defeat Zarok s champion Lord Kardok Zarok turns into a powerful monster but Dan manages to defeat him
As Zarok uses his last breath to cause his lair to collapse Dan escapes and Zarok s magical influence over the land is thwarted restoring the souls back to the living and putting the dead back to rest
With the magic cast on him also wearing off as a result Dan returns to his burial chamber where he once again enters eternal slumber
If the player has managed to collect all the Chalices Dan will ascend to the Hall of Heroes where he is hailed as the rightful Hero of Gallowmere

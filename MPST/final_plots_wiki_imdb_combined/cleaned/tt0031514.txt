Foundry worker François shoots and kills Valentin
François then locks himself in his apartment
He is soon besieged by the police who fail in an attempt to shoot their way into the room
As they regroup to decide how to apprehend him François begins to reminisce on how he came to be in this predicament
Several months earlier he had begun to date Françoise a florist s assistant
They bond over the similarities in their names and the fact that they both were orphans
François fell in love with her and hoped to marry her but she turned him down in order to have a relationship with the older Valentin a narcissistic manipulative dog trainer
Embittered François began a relationship with Clara Valentin s former assistant in his dog show
Over the next few weeks Clara fell in love with François but he preferred to have only a casual relationship with her she knew it was because he had continued to see Françoise with whom he was still in love
One day Valentin told François that he was in fact Françoise s father she was the product of a youthful dalliance
Later that afternoon François asked Françoise if Valentin was telling the truth
She denied it saying that Valentin habitually made up stories
But she also confessed that she was falling in love with François and wanted to be with him
Valentin confronted François in his apartment
He admitted to having lied about being Françoise s father and brandished a gun with which he had intended to shoot François
Instead he taunted François with allusions to his sexual encounters with Françoise
Enraged François picked up the gun and shot Valentin
Alone in his room and out of cigarettes François realized he had no hope of escape
He does not know that Françoise delirious with guilt was now being tended to by Clara
The police decide to throw tear gas into François s room in an attempt to subdue him
But just before they do François commits suicide by shooting himself in the heart

The special begins at home one night when Alvin Simon and Theodore were arguing about when exactly they were born
Theodore insists they were born on the 12th Alvin insists it was the 15th and Simon insists that it was the 18th
But not even their adoptive father Dave Seville knows the exact date so Alvin decides that the only way to find out would be to look for their long lost mother
However Dave would never let them go so they decide to have their female friends The Chipettes take over the house
When Dave comes downstairs the next morning and sees the girls there he realizes that the boys went to find their mother and fears that they could get hurt by wild animals in the forest
So he sets out to find them while the girls join him on his search
Meanwhile the boys are in the forest after having been told by a Forest Ranger that the great winter drove animals over Eagle s Peak
As they continue their journey they imagine what their mother might be like while asking other forest animals about her climbing mountains and swinging across rivers
Later that night the boys decide to go home when they encounter a wild boar that is presumed to have escaped from hunters
It chases them into a log
Then it grabs the log by its tusks and throws it to the bottom of a mountainside knocking them unconscious
However someone at a nearby home finds them and takes them in for shelter
When the boys wake up the next day they find themselves inside the home of their long lost mother named Vinny who is happy to see her boys again
Meanwhile Dave and the Chipettes are right on the boys trail while Dave wonders why they left him
However the girls assure him that just because the boys are looking for their mother doesn t mean that they don t love him anymore
Back at Vinny s home the boys reminisce with her about when they were babies and then she tucks them in with a tendersweet lullaby that she used to sing to them when they were babies
The next morning the boys hoping to have waffles for breakfast end up disappointed when they hear that they re having maple leaves berries and nuts
A bitter Alvin then claims that Vinny never loved him and his brothers to begin with because she left them on a stranger s doorstep
However Vinny then tries to explain that she had her reasons for doing this those reasons being that the boys were too young to survive the long winter and that there was a severe food shortage
That it was the great winter that was very cold and wasn t getting any better
However she knew of a man who was very kind to the forest animals and had no choice but to leave them there with him
She then admits that giving them up was the hardest thing she ever had to do
Alvin feels guilty for the thoughts he had before
Suddenly the boar reappears and tries to ram its way into the house several times but soon notices a small rabbit and chases it instead
Meanwhile Dave and The Chipettes are still looking for them
Back at Vinny s home after noticing the door being completely broken the boys decide to have her come with them to live with Dave
But she tells them that she doesn t know anything about life in the city and that she wants them to live with her
Alvin failing to understand and not wanting to leave Dave behind walks away to a nearby log while Simon and Theodore try to comfort him telling him that they can t expect her to live in the city that it would be like them trying to live in the forest and that their lives are completely different even though it doesn t mean that she doesn t love them
Suddenly the Boar comes back and attacks them
After missing the boys the boar sees Vinny and rams into her injuring her badly
A weakened Vinny then backs up by the cliffside and jumps up to a nearby branch while the boar misses and falls into the river to his death
The boys hurry to their mother and fear the worst
They take her home and tend her wounds while Alvin recites something that Simon and Theodore told him
The next day the boys find that Vinny is nowhere to be seen and when they reach downstairs they learn that Vinny and the others are throwing them a surprise party and that she tells them she never forgets their birthday and that she always celebrates it on the 14th
They then celebrate with some blues music
Dave and The Chipettes all of whom are tired and exhausted find them but decide not to disturb them
However the boys notice Dave and run up to him and give him a hug telling him that they are coming back with him after all but they ll be back in the forest for visits
After another celebration at Vinny s house this time with Dave and the girls the special ends with the boys later that night back at home in bed with their birthday presents
They thank Dave for the presents
Then Alvin after being asked what his birthday wish was says that he initially wished they were like other families but he has now realized that they have parents who love them very much
A teary but happy Dave then closes the door as he leaves after hearing this

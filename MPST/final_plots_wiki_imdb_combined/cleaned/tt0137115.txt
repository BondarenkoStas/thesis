In Point Pleasant West Virginia home to the legend of the Mothman a group of high school seniors camp out next to a river near an old mill where the Mothman is supposedly buried under the incinerators
While pranking their friend Jamie by trying to scare him with the Mothman s legend the teenagers accidentally drown Jamie while they are pulling him into the water while swimming in the river
The teenagers decide to cover up the accident by claiming that Jamie hit his head while jumping into the river and even hit his head with a rock to prove this
Ten years later one of the teenagers named Katherine Grant now a reporter for the Washington Weekly returns to Point Pleasant after her boss sends her on a matter of the tenth Mothman Festival
Katherine meets with her former boyfriend Derek Carpenter and later with the rest of her friends who accidentally killed Jamie
After Katherine and her friends meet in a bar Jared heads back to his RV where he is murdered by the Mothman himself
The next day Katherine and Derek head to Jared s where they can t find him and leave
Yet they miss his remains and guts on the other side of the RV
Katherine and Derek head to the Mothman Festival where they meet a blind old man named Frank Waverly who tells them of the Mothman s legend warning them that he will strike again
Later that night at the bar Richard almost commits suicide over Jamie s death but changes his mind just as he is about to shoot himself
The Mothman enters through a mirror and kills Richard with broken glass
The Mothman then goes after Sally who drives away in her car
Sally s car stops and she is brutally murdered by the Mothman
The next day Katherine who is now starting to believe in the Mothman comes to Frank for help
Frank tells Katherine of how Point Pleasant is the only land in North America never to be occupied by Indians
This is because they feared that the land was home to an evil spirit
When the white settlers took over the land they killed the Indians and their chief Cornstalk escaped to where Point Pleasant is now
The whites found Cornstalk who offered a treaty with the whites
But the whites tortured him and before dying Cornstalk summoned the evil spirit so that he could take revenge on any murderers in the area
The whites cut Cornstalk in pieces and put them in a mirror lined coffin
Hence the spirit Mothman can only enter our world through reflective surfaces
Katherine leaves and heads back to her motel room where she is attacked by the Mothman who enters through the television screen
Derek arrives and wards off the Mothman
Katherine and Derek go to Frank for help where Frank admits to blinding himself because he and one of his friends accidentally murdered the mayor s son while driving drunk in 1967
Casey later discovers Jared s dead remains at his RV and is attacked by the Mothman
He manages to escape and calls Derek
Frank gives Katherine and her friends a bone like object to perform a banishing ritual to stop the Mothman
Katherine Derek and Casey head to the old mill where they perform the banishing ritual near an incinerator
However the banishing ritual actually appears to summon the Mothman as it appears after the banishing ritual is performed and hunts down Katherine and Derek as he chases them through the mill
Just as the Mothman has Katherine and Derek cornered Casey shoots him and the creature flies off
As Katherine and Derek attempt to escape Casey shoots at the Mothman once more and is carried away by the creature as Katherine and Derek leave
Katherine and Derek arrive at Frank s where he traps them in a tunnel where they are cornered by the Mothman
However Katherine and Derek eventually escape and find Casey who is actually alive
The three head to the Mothman Festival that night where Frank is planning on the Mothman taking revenge on the entire town
Frank arrives at the festival where all of the attendants spot the Mothman in the sky as he attacks a woman on a Ferris wheel
Katherine and Derek arrive at the scene where Frank is finally killed by the Mothman as well as the mayor who shoots at the Mothman
Casey rams the Mothman with his car and attempts to kill the creature
However the Mothman kills Casey and prepares to kill Katherine
Katherine fires her gun at the Mothman which sets off an explosion that seems to kill the Mothman
However the Mothman is still alive and again prepares to kill Katherine
Derek distracts the Mothman for a second until the creature carries him off and drops him
The Mothman then prepares to finally kill Katherine
Katherine stabs the Mothman in the chest with the bone like object which causes the Mothman to burst into flames and black moths
The next day Katherine visits Derek who is wounded and in a hospital
Katherine s eyes turn red and black moths fly from her
She is seemingly the Mothman and is preparing to kill Derek
As the scene closes a black moth is seen which bursts into flames and turns into the Mothman s glowing red eyes

Littlefoot notices a Longneck herd entering the Great Valley and informs his grandparents who tell him that the Longnecks are their cousins and that they must go and greet them
Upon the herd s arrival the Old One the herd s leader tells the Great Valley s residents that her herd has been migratory ever since a heavy period of rain turned their old home into a marshland called The Land of Mists and became the home of many dangerous creatures
Later Littlefoot meets a female Longneck named Ali and invites her to play
He introduces her to his friends but as she is not used to associating with diverse species she is afraid of them
Meanwhile Grandpa falls severely ill
The Old One notes that the illness is lethal and that no dinosaurs recover from it unless they eat the petals of the Night Flower a flower which can only be found in the Land of Mists
Though Littlefoot is warned that the Land of Mists is too dangerous he becomes determined to save his grandfather and asks Ali to take him there
She agrees on the condition that Cera Ducky Petrie and Spike don t come claiming that they will slow them down
As the two of them make their way they pass through a cave and a sudden earthshake causes various stalagmites and stalactites to come crashing down separating them
Ali decides to return to the Valley and convince the others to help her free Littlefoot
Meanwhile Littlefoot tries to find a way out and meets an old Archelon named Archie who offers to help him dig through the rocks
As they work Littlefoot and Archie are interrupted by a Ichthyornis named Ichy and a sightless Deinosuchus named Dil who intend to eat them
Ichy and Dil pursue Littlefoot and Archie but are knocked out when Ali and Littlefoot s friends dig a hole in the rock wall and send rocks tumbling down on them
Archie shows them a way to the Land of Mists and reminds them to stay close together before departing
In the Land of Mists Cera is separated from the group
The others meet a mouse that Ducky names Tickles after his fur and Tickles help them find Cera
However Cera falls into a river and is pursued by Ichy and Dil
Ali saves Cera and distracts the predators after which Cera softens towards Ali
Later Ali explains her prejudicial behavior but remarks that her attitudes towards Littlefoot s friends has now changed
When the seven stop for the night they realize they are in a field of Night Flowers after they bloom and quickly stock up on them
As they make their way home Ichy and Dil return for another attack
During the chase Ducky falls into a river while retrieving a Night Flower and Spike speaks for the first time by calling out her name
As Petrie rescues her from the predators Ichy and Dil get into an argument when Dil mistakes Ichy for Ducky and tries to eat him
When they dismiss each other Dil flings Ichy off with her tail but is pursued by a Hydrotherosaurus shortly after
Meanwhile the children say goodbye to Tickles and head home
They give Grandpa the blossoms and he gets better upon eating them
Ali then leaves with her herd but not before trying to convince Spike to say goodbye which he does not as he is too interested in consuming leaves
The narrator concludes that Littlefoot and the others will indeed meet Ali again one day

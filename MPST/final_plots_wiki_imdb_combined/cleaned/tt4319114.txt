In not too distant future Earth is dying The UN calls for an immediate evacuation to Mars
But while leaders of states launch mass evacuations the President of the Grand Turkish Republic has his own agenda
He demands to eat a chicken schnitzel for once before leaving Earth or else no one is going anywhere
Kamil the Chief aid to the President is charged with the task to find the last schnitzel Kamil unsure what to do first turns to the Minister of Nutrition for help
But all that the Minister can offer Kamil is a bottle of chicken flavored pills
Kamil then contacts the Worlds Museum of Live Food in Copenhagen upon the suggestion of the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Unfortunately Danish Minister of Museums Skov Jensen tells him that the exhibition was never real
But the simultaneous broadcast of the US Presidents speech exposes Jensens dishonesty
As it turns out Jensen and other EU States has eaten the whole museums exhibits which outrages the US President as he was not invited to the party
In retaliation he responds by launching all of nuclear warheads which will hit Europe in one hour Pressed with time Kamil takes matters in his own hands making one of the hardest decisions in his life
But his personal sacrifice pays off
He serves the last schnitzel to the President in the nick of time and to his surprise the President loves every bit of it With grand relief the Grand Turkish Republic shuttles leave for Mars as Earth explodes behind them

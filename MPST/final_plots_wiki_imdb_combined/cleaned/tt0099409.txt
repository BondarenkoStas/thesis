In Utah Nancy Breyers is a defense lawyer who is inexplicably in love with client Michael Bosworth a sociopathic convict
During a break from a courtroom hearing Nancy sneaks a gun to Bosworth
After Bosworth snaps a guard s neck Bosworth and Nancy slip away
Bosworth tears at Nancy s clothing and leaves her behind where she will tell authorities Bosworth held her at gunpoint during his escape
He speeds off in a car with his brother Wally and their partner the hulking half witted Albert then changes cars with one Nancy has left for him in a remote location
In the meantime decorated Vietnam veteran Tim Cornell arrives at his former home with his ex wife Nora who have two kids 15 year old May and her 8 year old brother Zack
Tim and Nora separated due to his infidelity with a younger woman and Tim shows up trying to reconcile with Nora with whom he is still in love
Needing a hideout until Nancy can catch up with them the Bosworth brothers and Albert settle on the Cornells home with a For Sale sign which is seemingly picked by Bosworth at random
Somehow Bosworth picks up intimate details of the Cornells and one by one all of them find themselves the prisoners of the Bosworth brothers and Albert
Nancy s innocent act does not fool FBI agent Brenda Chandler who puts surveillance on her every move
Nancy eventually cuts a deal with Chandler to have charges against her reduced by betraying Bosworth
As young Zack tries to escape through a window a friend of the Cornells who visits the house by chance meets him
Bosworth makes the family friend enter inside by force and as they discuss Bosworth shoots him then makes Albert dispose of the body as Albert gets anxiety ridden and decides to go off on his own
As Albert leaves while covered in blood he intercepts two beautiful college girls who then denounce him with a small gas station owner
The owner calls the authorities who chase after Albert
Albert ignores their order to surrender and is killed by police agents on a river bank
Nancy begs Agent Chandler to give her a gun but unbeknownst to Nancy Chandler removes the bullets
As she goes to the Cornells house the house gets surrounded and as a shootout starts by Bosworth Wally is fatally wounded in a barrage of FBI bullets and falls on top of a shocked Nancy
Wally s gun is taken away by Tim
Bosworth holds a gun on Nora and is prepared to use it if Tim interferes
He is unaware that Tim has removed the bullets
Tim then drags the criminal outside where Bosworth ignores the FBI s order to surrender and is fatally shot

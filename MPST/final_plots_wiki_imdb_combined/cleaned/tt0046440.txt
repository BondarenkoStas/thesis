Granny and Tweety are riding through the desert in their wagon to the tune of Oh
Susanna when they are ambushed by Indians
They are forced to hole up in a fort where Granny begins to shoot them down while Tweety counts
On the tenth one nearly takes Tweety but is shot down just in time
More attempts include an archer and a battering ram both foiled
One archer almost drags Tweety out again but Granny surprises him with a bomb instead
The cats attempts continue like this all of them backfiring or being foiled usually the cats are blown up or shot
In one instance the chief orders the actual Sylvester to sneak into the fort Sylvester emerges later with the top of his head having been scalped off by Granny
Finally Granny and Tweety disguise themselves as a fellow Indian and lead the cats into the powder house
When one asks for a match they kindly oblige and the powder house explodes causing all the cats to erupt into the sky and then fall
Oh my goodness
Tweety comments It s raining putty tats

On January 18 1960 Frank Morris arrives at the maximum security prison Alcatraz
Soon after arriving he is sent in to meet the warden who curtly informs him that no inmate has ever successfully escaped from Alcatraz
Among the inmates Morris makes acquaintances with the eccentric Litmus who is fond of desserts English a black inmate serving two life sentences for killing two white men in self defense and the elderly artist and chrysanthemum grower Doc
Morris also makes an enemy of the rapist Wolf who harasses him in the showers and later attacks him in the prison yard with a knife both men spend time in the hole
When the warden discovers that Doc has painted an ungainly caricature of him as well as other policemen on the island itself he permanently removes Doc s painting privileges in response a depressed Doc hacks off his own fingers with a hatchet from the prison workshop and is led away
Later Morris meets bank robber brothers John and Clarence Anglin who are his old friends from another prison sentence and he makes the acquaintance of the prisoner in the cell next to his car thief Charley Butts
Later during mealtime Morris places one of Doc s chrysanthemums at the table in honor of Doc but the warden stops by and crushes it
Litmus is enraged but as he reaches out to grab the warden he suffers a fatal heart attack
The warden coldly reminds Morris that some men are destined never to leave Alcatraz alive
Morris notices that the concrete around the grille in his cell is weak and can be chipped away which evolves into an escape plan
Over the next few months Morris the Anglins and Butts dig through the walls of their cells with spoons make papier mâché dummies to act as decoys and construct a raft out of raincoats
On June 11 1962 the inmates decide to leave
Wolf has been released from solitary confinement and prepares to stab Frank with a knife but English is able to intercept him
That night Frank John Clarence and Charley plan to meet in the passageway and escape
Charley panics and fails to rendezvous with them
Carrying the flotation gear Frank and the brothers access the roof and avoid the searchlights
From there they scramble down the side of the building into the prison yard climb over a barbed wire fence and make their way to the shoreline of the island where they inflate the raft
The three men enter the water partially submerged they cling to the raft and use their legs as the primary propelling force and kicking
When their escape is discovered the following morning a massive manhunt ensues
The warden does not want to blemish his perfect record and insists that the men drowned despite no bodies being found
On a rock on the shore of Angel Island he finds a chrysanthemum and throws it in the water after being told that they do not grow there

Daffy Duck and Porky Pig work in the hotel business on the western frontier
At the start of the cartoon we see Daffy sweeping the floor and exclaiming his dissatisfaction for his job
When Porky calls Daffy over and gives him a new broom as a present Daffy throws his hat on the floor in disgust and quits the job
Daffy then proceeds to build his own hotel business directly across the way from Porky
Porky looks on exclaiming all that because he gave Daffy a present
Daffy does everything he can to persuade business to his new establishment hanging signs reading Free Lunch Free TV We Give Plaid Stamps and Western Spoken Here
After Porky wishes Daffy luck he spots a customer whom he hastily invites to his newly built establishment
Upon his arrival to the hotel Daffy tries to take the gentleman s order but is instead robbed
Despite Daffy s many attempts at wooing customers with his free advertisements Porky s establishment is receiving all the business
Daffy wonders what Porky has that he doesn t so he wanders over to take a peek
Daffy sees a vaudeville show
Determined to fight fire with fire Daffy goes back to his hotel dressed up as a girl and then dances lip syncs to a record playing The Latin Quarter on the front porch to sway potential customers away from Porky s establishment
This works well until the record starts skipping and the bystanders realize what s going on

Daffy then attempts to join forces with Porky and asks him to be partners
When Porky replies by telling Daffy he has all the business he needs Daffy accidentally shoots himself with his own gun and then decides to forcefully destroy Porky s business
First Daffy tries to drop a boulder off a cliff onto Porky s hotel
It backfires when the boulder misses bounces and crushes Daffy s hotel to which makes Daffy s head change to resemble a donkey and he makes a he haw noise

The explosives blow up and we see that Porky has struck oil
We then see that Porky s hotel is destroyed and closed with a sign posted reading moved to a new location
Upon the panning of the camera we see his new and improved five star hotel in which Daffy now works for Porky again
Porky offers Daffy the chance to clean up and gives him his own office
When he opens the door to his office several brooms and mops fall out of the closet
Daffy then picks up a janitor hat and puts it on

Dalton Trumbo is a screenwriter whose talent places him among the elite of Hollywood
However his active membership in the Communist Party of the USA draws the contempt of staunchly anti Soviet entertainment industry figures such as columnist Hedda Hopper and actor John Wayne
Trumbo is one of 10 screenwriters subpoenaed to testify before the House Committee on Un American Activities regarding alleged Communist propaganda in Hollywood films
They refuse to directly answer questions confident that a liberal majority on the Supreme Court will overturn the convictions for contempt of Congress
Trumbo s friend Edward G Robinson who supports the cause sells the Portrait of PÃ¨re Tanguy to raise money for their legal defense fund
The unexpected deaths of Justices Wiley Rutledge and Frank Murphy ruin Trumbo s plan to appeal to the Supreme Court
In 1950 Trumbo serves 11 months in Federal Correctional Institution in Ashland Kentucky
As the Hollywood Blacklist expands to exclude more communists and communist sympathizers from working in the industry Trumbo and his comrades are abandoned by Robinson and producer Buddy Ross who disavow them to protect their careers
Trumbo is released from prison but he remains blacklisted and his finances and family life become increasingly strained
He resorts to giving the screenplay for Roman Holiday to his friend Ian McLellan Hunter to take credit and a share of the money and eventually the Academy Award for Best Story
Selling his idyllic lakeside home and moving to a house in the city he goes to work as a pseudonymous screenwriter for the low budget King Brothers Productions also farming out the writing of B movie screenplays to fellow blacklisted writers
He puts his wife Cleo and teenage children to work as his support staff adding to domestic conflict
King Brothers film The Brave One an original story by Trumbo under a pseudonym receives an Academy Award he cannot claim
His blacklisted friend Arlen Hird dies from cancer destitute but an attempt by Hopper s allies to intimidate the head of King Brothers to fire Trumbo fails completely
Over time industry suspicion of Trumbo s ghostwriting develops but he is careful not to confirm it
In 1960 actor Kirk Douglas recruits him to write the screenplay for his epic film Spartacus and director Otto Preminger recruits him to script Exodus both publicly credit Trumbo as the screenwriter despite Hopper s futile efforts to intimidate Douglas into dropping Trumbo
By 1960 the effectiveness of the Blacklist has been broken to the point where newly elected US President John F Kennedy publicly endorses Spartacus and Trumbo and others are able to begin rebuilding their careers
Ten years later finally receiving his due accolades from Hollywood Trumbo speaks about how the Blacklist victimized them all those who stood by their principles and lost their jobs and also those who compromised their principles to keep them

Simon is a young orphan being raised under the care of his uncle Tom
The early scenes of the film show him filming his conversation in the hospital with his dying grandfather
Through the eyes of Simon we see the grandfather as a caring wise man while through the perspective of his uncle we see the racist backwards side
Simon s grandfather hated Simon s father and claims that he intended to kill Simon s mother in the car crash when as Simon finds out at the film s conclusion he had an eye condition
This condition prevented him from being able to drive at night as the glare from oncoming headlights would blind him
The evening of the car crash reveals a different side of the story causing the memories of each character to meet head on connecting disparate stories of each character to unite in an Egoyanesque conclusion Simon s family narrative is cleverly knit into a news story presented to Simon by his high school French teacher as a translation exercise
An article is read by the teacher about an attempted bombing of an aircraft by a man who put explosives in his pregnant wife s luggage
Simon gets the idea to translate the story and write it from the perspective of the child in the woman s womb
The teacher encourages Simon to develop his story as a drama exercise however Simon presents it to the class and to the world via the Internet as if he really was that child
The teacher s silence as we find out later is owing to her relationship with Simon s late father who died with his mother in a car crash when he was still a child
The narrative of the car crash and the attempted bombing of the plane become intertwined as a way for the characters to deal with their past experiences which they have all been trying to deny The film is about a search for identity in a digital age where the truth is oftentimes irrelevant
Simon s story of his suicide bomber father is met on the Internet with sympathy anger and even support as we see a skinhead on webcam telling Simon that his father was a hero
The alienation experienced by Simon in relation to the world wide response he receives to this made up story ultimately serves as a mechanism that forces him to turn away from his computer and video screen to face the actual issues he experienced as a child
Simon s story takes a twist that involves all the other characters in his life everyone s narrative culminating in the piecing together of a fragmented past that needed to be re examined in order for those in the present to be healed and re connect with the people in their lives

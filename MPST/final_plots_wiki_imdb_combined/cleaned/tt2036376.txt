She is interrupted by her colleague Lu who comforts her and invites her out for a drink over Shae s breakup with Terry
Shae and Lu go out to another bar where they meet Simon Eric and Duncan
They drink and dance with them and then go back to Eric and Duncan s apartment
Shae kisses Simon and then goes to the bathroom where she passed out drunk
Feeling unwell again Shae decides to go home
Simon offers to take her home saying that he was about to leave anyway
They get a taxi together and are dropped off outside her apartment building

He persists asking first for her number and then for a kiss goodnight
She tells him to leave and he becomes violent grabbing her neck and forcibly kissing her
She hits him and runs upstairs
Before she can unlock her door he catches her pushes her onto the floor and rapes her

With no one to talk to she goes to Terry s house
He is furious that she has turned up at his house unannounced and takes her home
They go into her apartment and Shae having not told him that she was raped yet hugs him
He misunderstands and starts kissing her
She tells him to stop but he tries to force himself on her
She shouts at him to get off her and starts crying
He leaves telling her that he doesn t know what she wants from him
The next day Lu calls her and they go to a police station to report the crime
There the hostile and skeptical Officer Daniels gives Shae paperwork to fill in and sends her to the waiting area
Shae files her report with an unsympathetic detective and Lu notices Daniels looking at her
She flirts with him and she asks him if he wants to go somewhere to have sex
The go a local hotel where Lu cuffs him to the bed takes his gun and shoots him
Lu goes to Shae s apartment and tells her that they need to deal with the situation themselves by going back to Eric and Duncan s apartment and finding out where Simon lives for Shae to get her revenge
She tells Shae that she has a gun which she got from a police officer
They go back there and probe Duncan for Simon s address
He doesn t know it and when he jokes about how Eric told them he and Shae had sex Lu shoots him dead
Shae laughs and then throws up but is okay with it
When Eric comes back he tells them Simon s address and Lu shoots him too
They go to Simon s workshop and find him working alone
Shae knocks him unconscious and they tie him to his table
When he wakes up they torture and kill him by dismembering his limbs
Next they ambush Terry kidnapping him at gunpoint and driving him off in his own car
They drive to a secluded part of the woods and take him out of the car
Shae points the gun at him and he begs for her forgiveness
She can t bring herself to kill him and he starts to run away but Lu takes the gun and shoots him
They stay in a motel that night and when Shae starts crying Lu gets into bed with her and holds her
The next morning they talk about what they did and while Shae says that killing all those men who wronged her did not make her feel any better Lu enjoyed it and says that she enjoys killing and hurting people because she can
They go home and return to their lives
After a class Shae is asked out by her classmate Tyler and they go to the fair
She goes back to her apartment that evening and finds Lu waiting for her annoyed that she is back so late because she had wanted to surprise her with a ready dinner
Shae goes to a Halloween party with Tyler who is DJing
Lu secretly arrives and when Shae is in the bathroom and everyone else is watching fireworks on the roof she kills Tyler with a sword
Shae finds his body and returns home finding Lu s sword on a table
Lu steps out of the shower stark nude and tells Shae that she did it for us and to protect her
Shae takes the sword and kills Lu
Some time later Shae returns to work at the bar
During a break she is interrupted by a crying co worker
Shae asks is it a guy
and the woman replies that it is
As the two sit together a vision of Lu is seen behind Shae

In Storybrooke In the present day at an undisclosed location Gold chases down and captured a nun and the Evil Queen has shown up to witness what he planned to do to her as she is aware of his hatred towards fairies
As Gold reminds the Evil Queen that she is supposed to kill Zelena on his behalf he proceeds to toss magical dust on the fairy causing her to age immediately which he wants to serve as a message to the fairies
This has Belle more worried after seeing the aged nun and knowing that he ll use everything to take their child away
While doing research on how to stop Gold Belle comes across a Manual on Defeating Dark One book and as she opens it a red string appears on the floor that matches the page on the book and she followed it to her son who tells her the answer was in front of her and suddenly wakes up on top of the book realizing that she was dreaming while researching for the answer
In the meantime Jasmine tells Snow that she is nervous about the lamp assuming that a genie s magic could help her find Agrabah but fears what the genie will want in return
She decides to summon the genie anyway but when she rubs the lamp all that comes out are two cuffs implying that the genie was freed
Aladdin then puts the cuffs on turning himself into a genie instead
Around the same time the Evil Queen confronted Zelena and is ready to kill her but is stopped by Regina who not only takes the heart away from her other half but tells her that Gold is using her
Regina allowed the The Evil Queen to get away for now as she is aware that her heart has a dark hole inside of her
Even after saving Zelena s life Regina still upset over Robin s death can t forgive her while The Evil Queen confronted Gold and the partnership dissolves between them
The book that Belle slept on captures the attention of Hook as the book is written in Squid ink and suggests that he and Emma take care of the situation
When they arrived to the Pawn Shop Hook provoked Gold s anger to allow Emma to use the ink on him
However just as they were searching the shop Emma s visions resurfaced and her hand started to shake again and when they checked on Gold he disappeared ready to confront Belle with the aging dust telling her that he thinks their son may be the only person who could ever love him and is willing to do anything to steal their child from her
However Gold started having second thoughts after Belle tells him that she might also lose him forever
At Granny s Belle Emma and Hook have a conversation
As Emma tells Hook that a new vision involving her death has appeared Belle drops her mug on the ground revealing that the tea she was drinking was a spell which causes her pregnancy to accelerate and she goes into labor
As Emma and the fairies help Belle deliver she finds herself again in the dream world talking to her son who gives his mother a message you know what you must do
As Belle successfully delivers the baby she asked Mother Superior to make a request to be his fairy godmother and to take him far away from Storybrooke where he will be safe from Gold
Belle then named her son Gideon in honor of her favorite book hero before Mother Superior sends the child away
When Gold who was prevented to enter by a protection spell placed on the nunnery by Emma and the Fairies until the baby was delivered arrived to see his son he became furious with her as she refused to tell him what his name was and where he went but vows to find him
When Gold returns to his shop the Evil Queen is waiting and tells him that she was responsible placing the spell in Belle s tea that resulted in her pregnancy to accelerate
The Evil Queen tells Gold that he just made an enemy of her but he countered that she is merely a pawn in his game and vows to get even but not before she leaves with a message about the way Fairies make great mothers then he throws everything to the ground
Finally after Hook tells her that Regina reversed the aging spell on the nun Emma tells Hook that she feels stronger than ever ready to confront her vision returned to the shop where she finds the sword that will kill her in her vision and takes it

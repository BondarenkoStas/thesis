Mark decided to answer all ads in the paper tell everyone to look for the man with the rose and then not wear a rose
Mark figured that Vanessa would be happy enough that Mark answered her ad and would not worry about the rose and that the other women would not get mad at him because without a rose they would not know that Mark is the one who answered their ads
Earvin knew about Mark s plan and decided to go to the restaurant with the rose so that he could get a date with one of the women whose ad Mark had answered

The finale ended with a goodbye from the cast
While the series finale was viewed in its entirety on ABC affiliates in the Eastern Central and Mountain time zones ABC pre empted the episode on the West Coast 5 minutes in to break the news of the death of Princess Diana and the finale was never re run on ABC
Other than several complaints from viewers on the West Coast there was little if any controversy as this episode generally had low ratings and aired on a Saturday
However the episode eventually aired on syndication
ABC actually intended to bring back Hangin with Mr Cooper and Step By Step to TGIF for the 1996 97 season as midseason replacements if freshmen series Sabrina the Teenage Witch and or Clueless were cancelled
The wedding of Mark and Vanessa would have most likely been the sixth season premiere episode had the show been renewed after season five as Mark Curry reportedly wanted the wedding to begin a new season not be a series finale
Hangin with Mr Cooper was the only TGIF show cancelled after the 1996 97 season as CBS picked up Step by Step and Family Matters when that network attempted a TGIF style comedy lineup on Fridays called the CBS Block Party

In the midst of a unprecedented crime wave in the city of Columbus Ohio Governor John Meserve gives a press conference about his crime reduction efforts
When questioned by protestors about a proposed pipeline Meserve promises that he has commissioned an independent study of the pipeline
Abbie Hill and her family are watching the press conference and they are thrilled that the Governor has referenced the work her mother Vivian is doing
Vivian heads to the airport to pick up her husband Stanley who has returned from a job interview to manage a factory in Orlando Florida
When they arrive at their car they notice one of the tires is flat
Before Stanley can fix it a man approaches and asks them for money
Stanley politely refuses but another man sneaks up on Stanley and stuns him with a blow to the head
The first man stabs Vivian and takes her wallet
Stanley watches the men flee
The police use Stanley s descriptions to quickly capture the man who killed Vivian
However they let him go after Stanley positively identifies him
This enrages Stanley and now that he knows the man s name is Charley he starts to stalk him
When he sees a carefree Charley on the street Stanley goes home and retrieves a case from behind a wall
The case has several passports foreign currencies and several weapons
He calls Dennis his friend from the Special Forces and asks him for information about Charley and his crew
Dennis runs black operations from beneath a barbershop
Stanley uses Dennis intelligence to track down one of the men who attacked him at a local bar
As the man lies dying he hints that Vivian s murder was more than just a robbery
Stanley and Dennis are photographed as they dispose of the body
Local crime lord Lemi K is furious when he sees the photograph and he orders hits on the men who killed one of his crew
Stanley tracks down another man who was involved in the attack
He confronts him at a tattoo parlor after getting the words I Am Wrath tattooed on his back
After killing the man Stanley makes off with a bag full of drugs and money
Stanley and Dennis use the bag as bait to lure Charley to the VIP room at a Korean nightclub
Before being killed Charley tells Stanley that Vivian s murder was ordered by Lemi because she was too nosy
Lemi has tracked down Abbie and is holding her hostage
Stanley and Dennis arrive and kill Lemi
When two corrupt cops arrive Stanley realizes the entire plot was organized by Governor Meserve
He infiltrates the Governor s mansion and murders him
When the police arrive Stanley raises a weapon prompting them to shoot him in his bulletproof vest
While he recovers in the hospital one of the corrupt cops tries to assassinate Stanley but Stanley shoots him with a hidden gun
Dennis spirits Stanley away from the hospital and the film ends with Abbie reading a postcard from Stanley that he sent from Sao Paulo

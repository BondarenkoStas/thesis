Setting Arcanum is the name of the fantasy world in which the game unfolds
It consists of a continental mainland and three islands
The world is inhabited by various races resembling those from the works of Tolkien including humans elves and half elves dwarves gnomes halflings orcs ogres and various wildlife
Players can choose from humans elves dwarves gnomes halflings and human hybrid races including half elves half orcs and half ogres as playable races
The continent is divided between several different political entities
The Unified Kingdom is rapidly industrializing
Its two largest cities are Tarant and Ashbury and it is the most technologically advanced kingdom
The Kingdom of Cumbria is a deteriorated kingdom consisting of Dernholm and Black Root and ruled by an old conservative king
The Kingdom of Arland extending from Caladon to Roseborough is a small but thriving monarchy west of the Stonewall range
The Glimmering Forest the largest in Arcanum is home to the elven city of Qintarra and the dark elven city of T sen Ang and has been untouched by the technological advancements of the time
The Stonewall and Grey Mountain Ranges are home to the remaining dwarven clans the Black Mountain Clan the Stonecutter Clan the Wheel Clan and the Iron Clan
Many other minor settlements also exist as well as containing ruins of past civilizations
The biggest of these is the ruins of Vendigroth the most advanced city on Arcanum which met a sudden and mysterious end
An important in game dynamic is the dichotomy of magic and technology in the world
Technology is explained to function by using physical law to produce a desired result e g a bolt of electricity from a Tesla Gun would arc through the most conductive path to its target with some plated armors being more prone to electrical damage than others
Magic on the other hand is explained to manipulate physical law to make a lightning spell follow the shortest path to the target instead of the natural path
The two are incompatible to the point that they overwhelm each other
Technological devices will become ineffective or even permanently inoperative in the presence of powerful magic and vice versa
Much of the population has chosen to embrace technology for its efficiency accessibility and permanent results
The elves dark elves and some humans continue to practice magic exclusively
This also affects interactions between different characters as spells cast on technologists or firearms used against mages have a failure rate
Orcs and ogres are looked down upon as savage feral peoples by Arcanum s civilized folk who own virtually all the industry of the major population centers
There is a great enmity between elves and dwarfs the former being naturally inclined towards magically defined society the latter being forerunners of the technology race and many elves blame the dwarfs for the rise of human technology and concomitant waning of elfish political power
Scientists are unwelcome in magical societies like Qintarra or Tulla but will be respected if they are righteous and good folk
Conversely a mage would be admitted onto a steam train only on the provision that he take a third class seat on the last caboose so as not to cause interference with the engine
Powerful mages may be denied transport altogether
Plot Arcanum begins with a cut scene of the IFS Zephyr a luxury zeppelin on her maiden voyage from Caladon to Tarant
Two monoplanes piloted by Half Ogre bandits close in on the craft and commence attack runs succeeding in shooting it down
An old gnome who is a passenger aboard the Zephyr is now in his death throes under charred debris and tells the player to bring a silver ring to the boy and promptly dies
Being the only survivor of the crash the main character is proclaimed as The Living One a holy reincarnate by the only witness to the crash Virgil
The story follows the player s path as he searches for the origin of the ring
Over the course of the game the player uncovers more about the history of the continent the motivation of the assassins who are trying to kill him and the identity of the one threatening to end all life in the land
Arcanum is an example of a non linear role playing game
At various points throughout the game players may take the story in different directions sometimes permanently removing different paths of action
The game s central quest ultimately develops according to how players navigate its dichotomies the most apparent being that of magic and technology
Many of the game s side quests allow for more than one solution depending on the player character s specializations and certain portions of the main quest can be solved more easily through dialogue than through combat
The game s magic technology and good evil alignments also influence what followers a character can attract throughout the game or how other NPCs will react to the player

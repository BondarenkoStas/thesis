In the poor Adelaide suburb of Salisbury North 16 year old Jamie lives with his distressed mother Elizabeth Harvey and his brothers including Troy who rapes Jamie
One day his mother s boyfriend takes indecent photographs of the boys
When the police are reluctant to intervene Elizabeth is contacted by Barry a gay man who introduces her to John
John who despises paedophiles and homosexuals continually harasses the boyfriend until he moves away
John begins to assume the role of Jamie s father figure
Barry tells John the names and addresses of paedophiles in the area and John creates a wall with pictures and details about each including notes saying things like I m coming for you
Jamie finds himself slowly drawn into John s homophobic and violent tendencies unable to escape his charismatic and intimidating dominance
On one occasion he has Jamie shoot his dog
John meanwhile influences the rest of the neighbourhood with his extremely homophobic views and separates Barry from his younger boyfriend Robert
Only Troy seems to dislike John
Barry soon disappears leaving behind only an answering machine message saying that he is going to Queensland
John brings Jamie in as the neophyte member of his small team who bury men
Shortly afterward Jamie visits his drug addicted best friend Gavin with John who takes a dislike to Gavin
Later one night John and Robert take Jamie into his garden shed and show him the bodies of Barry and Gavin
Distressed Jamie lashes out at John but remains under his influence
When John learns that Jamie has been abused by Troy he and Robert torture Troy
Jamie later kills the brutalised Troy in an act of mercy
Now desensitised Jamie assists John in carrying out several murders
John and his team store the bodies in the vault of an abandoned bank in the town of Snowtown
Jamie is persuaded by John to lure his half brother Dave to the bank building ostensibly to look at a computer for sale
Jamie drives with him to the town vaguely conscious of what he is doing and leads Dave into the building where he is met by John and Robert
Unaware of what is going on Dave watches Jamie shut the door of the bank
Against a black screen captions reveal that South Australian Police discovered the remains of eight people stored in barrels in the bank vault of Snowtown on 20 May 1999 and the following day John Bunting and Robert Wagner were arrested

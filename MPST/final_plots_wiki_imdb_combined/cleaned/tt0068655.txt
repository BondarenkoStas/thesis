Bernard Milan the second in command of France s Counter Espionage department is out to discredit his chief Louis Toulouse so that he can supplant him
When a French heroin smuggler who has been arrested in New York claims that the drug smuggling was a secret mission on the orders of French Counter Espionage the resulting bad press reflects on Toulouse who cannot prove that Milan was responsible
In retaliation Toulouse hatches a plot to deal with his ambitious subordinate in a room which he knows is filled with hidden microphones he sends his assistant Perrache to Orly airport at 9 30AM the next morning making Milan believe that Perrache has gone to meet a master spy who will expose Milan s treachery
However Toulouse secretly instructs Perrache to choose someone at random from the crowd of travelers arriving at that time
After considering several possibilities from the flight arriving at the specified time Perrache selects Fran√ßois Perrin an unsuspecting violinist who is noticeable because as the result of a practical joke played on him by his fellow orchestra members he has arrived wearing a black shoe on one foot and a reddish brown one on the other
Milan takes the bait and immediately begins a series of attempts to find out what Perrin knows never ever realizing the fact that Perrin knows nothing at all about espionage
Milan s machinations involve Perrin in a series of increasingly peculiar adventures which he either avoids or escapes from by pure luck and although Perrin is largely oblivious to the mayhem occurring around him he can t help noticing Milan s top agent the beautiful femme fatale Christine
Adding to the confusion is the fact that Perrin is having an affair with Paulette Lefebvre the wife of his best friend Maurice and Maurice upon accidentally hearing a recording of Perrin and Paulette having torrid sex jumps to the mistaken conclusion that Paulette is having an affair with a florist
All the time Toulouse and Perrache watch the chaos serenely although Perrache is troubled by his chief s callousness towards Perrin s possibly being killed
In a startling scene Christine greets Perrin at her apartment s front door in a demure high necked black velvet dress then turns around and shows that the dress is backless displaying discreet buttock cleavage
A slapstick love scene ensues concluding with Milan s decision to have Perrin eliminated
More mayhem and treachery follow climaxing in the deaths of not only agents from both Toulouse s and Milan s groups but also Milan himself who only learns the truth about Perrin from Perrache just before he dies
Realizing how he has been fooled Milan dies with a smile of appreciation
Maurice who has repeatedly walked in on the aftermaths of the shoot outs in Perrin s apartment suffers a total mental breakdown
The film ends as it began at Orly airport
Perrin pushes a huge Louis Vuitton steamer trunk in an airport luggage cart talking softly to Christine who is hidden inside
Their destination is Rio
Toulouse who has been watching Perrin s departure on a monitor instructs Perrache to contact Perrin when Perrin returns remarking After all he handles himself pretty well

Goofy is setting up an animal trap while Donald is in an igloo preparing a meal
Donald explains how sick he is of eating beans all the time and while noticing a penguin outside he hatches a plan while thinking of the penguin as roast chicken
The rest of the cartoon deals with him trying to lure a large group into his pot while Goofy is stuck trying desperately to catch a walrus
The name of Donald s and Goofy s trapping business is Donald Goofy Trapping Co
Their slogan is We Bring Em Back Alive
This is Donald s first time encountering penguins but it is not his last
The music played while Donald leads the penguins is the instrumental piece March of the Toys from the operetta Babes in Toyland also known as Parade Of The Tin Soldiers
When a baby penguin s tear turned into a snowball after being kicked out of the march by Donald the other penguins notice the snowball coming and quickly dived into the snow for safety but Donald runs for his life
When he gets into a collision with Goofy they both run for their lives until they get caught in the snowball and fall on their workplace completely destroying it
Donald and Goofy are then seen in the cages they brought for the animals they plan to catch and a can of beans falls into Donald s mouth making him grumble in anger when the show ends

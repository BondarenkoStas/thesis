The movie is adapted from the old Hispanic tale La Llorona
It starts with Beto and his little sister Kika trick or treating in the village
The streets were deserted dark and foggy
Kika was very loudly asking for candies which made Beto very nervous
While waiting for Kika to come back from a house that was far down the street Beto spotted an eerie figure going in her direction
In order to save his sister he called out the ghost s name La Llorona she heard and went after him
Kika finds Beto missing looks for him and finds him just in time to see him taken by La Llorona
Some time later a balloon with ship basket carrying five companions is flying over Xochimilco
The companions are Leo San Juan a young boy Don Andres an old knight Alebrije a fire breathing colorful dragon like creature and Moribunda and Finado two skeleton like kids resembling calavera
They re heading toward the village Xochimilco in response to Padre Tello s letter which asked for their help
They summoned a ghost friend Teodora who helped them in previous adventure but she disappeared right before the storm after teasing Leo
During the storm Moribunda fell out of the basket and Leo saved her but fell from the balloon into Kika s boat
Kika accidentally knocked Leo into the water then discovered his letter from Padre Tello and then accidentally hit him with her paddle knocking him out
Kika sees the damaged balloon he d fallen from heading toward La Isla de las Munecas
San Juan wakes up at Kika s house under her mom s care
Kika s mother told him a story of La Llorona whose name was actually Yoltzin instead of Mar√≠a
Yoltzin moved to Xochimilco with her two kids Ollin and Tonatiuh
She sold flowers to provide for her family and became well liked in the village
Everything changed one day when they were coming back home to find their house on fire
Yoltzin jumped off the boat desperate to save the house but forgot her kids on the boat which drifted away with them still on board
When she realized that it was too late and they disappeared without a trace
Villagers helped her searching for the kids
Days later though Ollin and Tonatiuh were found dead near a channel
Yoltzin didn t accept her children s death
She was driven crazy with grief and remorse
After her death the villagers started to hear ghostly moans
Yoltzin had become La Llorona a specter who came out at night to kidnap children though with no intent to harm them rather she seemed to want to take care of them maybe to make up for failing to take care of her own children
Padre Tello followed La Llorona for years trying to find out how to appease La Llorona until he disappeared
San Juan left Kika s house to find his friends and figure out the mystery of where Beto and the other kidnapped kids were with help of Padre Tello s journal
Kika followed him telling Leo that he needs her
La Llorona attacks Leo and Kika injuring Leo but Kika helps him and listens to his plans to find the old church where Ollin and Tonatiuh s graves are
Padre Tello s book says that Yoltzin has to see the graves to be at peace
Once again Leo and Kika were chased by La Llorona but this time Kika is kidnapped and Leo loses her trail
Meanwhile at the island of the puppets Andres was tangled in vines
After lot of screamming he was rescued from the puppets by Alebrije who was all covered in green slime after falling in the lake
Andres and Alebrije freed an old man from a cursed hand puppet named Pecas who was animated by the tears of La Llorona and had been forcing the old man to make puppets for him
The old man thanked them and told them where to find La Llorona
Leo San Juan asked Teodora to help him seek La Llorona and distract her while he looked for the old church where Yoltzin s kids were buried
Leo went into a sunken church and inside he found Kika and other kids sleeping
He saw that La Llorona was taking care of them and that they were unharmed
He ran deep down in the church until he found the church s crypt and searched for Ollin and Tonatiuh s graves
He finds a broken part of the kids graves when he s looking for his dropped necklace and puts it back into the grave fixing it
Kika angers the La Llorona telling her to let the other kids go and she almost has her soul taken by La Llorona but Leo saves her
La Llorona grabs Leo and starts taking his soul causing him to pass out then captures his friends by animating vines that had overtaken the sunken church
When she is about to hurt them Leo called out to her and showed her kid s name in the grave
When La Llorona saw their names she became reunited with her kids and thanked Leo for his help
Leo saw his mom one last time while he was unconscious
Other kidnapped kids woke up including Beto
Back in the village Leo and his friends said farewell to the villagers then get ready to go back to their hometown when Padre Godofredo appears and urges them to help another town in distress
He explains that Xochitl a friend of theirs was taken captive by mummies in Guanajuato

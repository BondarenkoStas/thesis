The Harikrishnans are one of the most famous lawyer duos in India
To avoid confusion one is called as Krishnan and Hari the other as
They head the organization called Harikrishnan Associates which consists of around 300 lawyers
They get engaged in a murder case of Guptan who was allegedly killed by Gabriel
Gabriel is a friend of Hari s sister and Harikrishnans become the defense lawyers upon her request
Harikrishnans begin investigation and come across Meera a friend of Guptan
Both of them fall in love with her
After some trouble over the matter they rediscover their friendship and get involved in the case again
They discover that Guptan actually died due to poisoning by his relatives who were doctors
At the end Meera decides to go for a random method of choosing her lover as she liked both Harikrishnans equally
Two different climaxes of the film show either of Harikrishnans winning the toss for being Meera s friend the losing person presumably becoming Meera s lover

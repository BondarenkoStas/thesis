With a Russian girl called Katia a young American photographer called David drives a Hummer from Los Angeles to a motel in the little desert town of Twentynine Palms
As she hardly speaks English and he speaks no Russian they talk in French a language in which neither is confident
Much of their communication is therefore non verbal and the two frequently misunderstand each other
Their days are spent driving and walking around the empty desert sometimes naked
They make love they fight or just pass time
The camera contrasts the vastness timelessness and emptiness of the landscape with the two small humans
Yet as well as natural beauty the desert contains menace
Stopped by a pick up full of rednecks David is beaten and raped while Katia is stripped and forced to watch
Back at the motel after their ordeal David loses his mind and after cutting off his hair stabs Katia to death
The police find the Hummer in the desert with his corpse beside it

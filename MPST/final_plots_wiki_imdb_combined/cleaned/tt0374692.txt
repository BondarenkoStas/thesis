Physicist Gordon Freeman is awoken from stasis by the mysterious G Man some years after Gordon and other scientists accidentally opened a portal to a dimension of hostile aliens at the Black Mesa Research Facility
The event attracted the attention of the Combine a multidimensional empire whose technological superiority allowed them to conquer Earth in seven hours
The Combine have implemented a brutal police state by biologically assimilating humans and other species and prevent humans from breeding via a suppression field
The G Man inserts Gordon into a train arriving at City 17 site of the Combine Citadel where Dr Wallace Breen the former Black Mesa administrator who negotiated Earth s surrender governs as the Combine s puppet ruler
After eluding Combine forces Gordon joins resistance members including Barney Calhoun a former Black Mesa security guard working undercover as a Combine police officer Dr Eli Vance former Black Mesa scientist and leader of the resistance Alyx Vance Eli s daughter and Dr Kleiner an eccentric Black Mesa scientist
After a failed attempt to teleport to the resistance base Black Mesa East from Kleiner s makeshift laboratory Gordon progresses on foot through the city s canal system
After obtaining an airboat he battles his way to Black Mesa East several miles from the city
Gordon is reintroduced to Eli and meets another resistance scientist Dr Judith Mossman
Alyx introduces Gordon to her pet robot D0g and gives him a gravity gun an instrument which can manipulate large objects
Black Mesa East comes under Combine attack and Eli and Mossman are taken to Nova Prospekt a Combine prison
Separated from Alyx Gordon detours through the zombie infested town of Ravenholm assisted by its last survivor Father Grigori
Escaping the town Gordon discovers a resistance outpost and uses a customized dune buggy to travel a crumbling coastal road to Nova Prospekt encountering Combine patrols and helping the resistance fend off raids
Gordon lays siege to Nova Prospekt by using pheromone pods to command the hordes of alien antlions that infest the coast
He reunites with Alyx in the prison and they locate Eli but discover that Mossman is a Combine informant
Before they can stop her Mossman teleports herself and Eli back to City 17 s Citadel
The Combine teleporter explodes as Gordon and Alyx use it to escape Nova Prospekt
Returning to Kleiner s lab Gordon and Alyx learn that the teleporter malfunctioned and that a week has passed
During their absence the resistance has mobilized against the Combine
In battle Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel
Gordon fights his way to the Citadel with the aid of D0g and Barney
There he is caught in a Combine confiscation chamber which destroys all his weapons except the gravity gun which is inadvertently supercharged by the forcefield allowing him to pick up Combine soldiers
Gordon is captured in a Combine transport pod and taken to Dr Breen s office where he and Mossman are waiting with Eli and Alyx in captivity
Breen explains his plans for further conquest of humanity by the Combine contrary to what he had told Mossman
Angered Mossman frees Gordon Alyx and Eli before Breen can teleport them off world
Breen tries to escape through a portal but Gordon destroys the portal reactor with the gravity gun
Just before the Citadel is destroyed in an ensuing explosion time is frozen
The G Man reappears praising Gordon for his actions in City 17
Making vague mention of offers for Gordon s services the G Man places him back into stasis

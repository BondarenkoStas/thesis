In 1789 on the eve of the French Revolution the court at the Palace of Versailles still live their routines relatively unconcerned by the increasing turmoil in Paris a mere twenty miles away
The routines are seen through the eyes of the young Sidonie Laborde who serves Queen Marie Antoinette
When news about the storming of the Bastille reaches the Court most aristocrats and servants desert the Palace and abandon the Royal Family fearing that the government is falling
But Sidonie a true believer in the monarchy refuses to flee
She feels secure under the protection of the Royal Family
She does not know these are the last three days she will spend by the Queen s side
The Queen orders Sidonie to disguise herself as Yolande Martine Gabrielle de Polastron Duchess of Polignac and serve as bait so that the latter can safely flee to Switzerland
This Sidonie does despite a prior warning from one of the Queen s ladies in waiting
Sidonie is stripped naked and then redressed in a green gown
The coach carrying Sidonie is also occupied by the real Duchess and her husband dressed as her servants
They treat her with disdain during the journey but she plays her role convincingly enough to enable the party to safely cross the border
As the film ends she remarks that she has no connections other than her position as reader to the Queen and soon she will be a nobody

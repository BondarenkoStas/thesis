Ninety four years after the Battle of Endor and the death of emperor Palpatine the New Republic has been resurrected and democracy once again presides in the galaxy
The Jedi Order is reestablished on the planet Yavin 4 and has continued to train new Jedi Knights in the art of peace and justice
But all is not peaceful in this new world
With the fall of the Galactic Empire the ancient Skenvi Empire now comes out of the woodworks
The Skenvi now oppose the New Republic for control over the galaxy with their growing empire
The Skenvi seek to seize control of all the galaxy s most valuable resources to cripple their enemies
And if a planet refuses to join them they have been known to take very aggressive actions
Caught in between this struggle over the fate of the galaxy is the little planet of Coreign
The planet possesses a very powerful resource that would greatly favour the side that has access to it if a galactic war was to emerge
In its eagerness to gain access to Coreign s resources the Skenvi Empire sends its most infamous negotiator Lord Siege
He is a man who is known throughout the galaxy for seeing that the Skenvi Empire gets what it wants by all means necessary
The New Republic sends two of its Jedi ambassadors Jedi Master Soran Darr and his Padawan Raven Darkham
Toward the end of the story a suggestion was raised of the possibility that Jedi Raven and Princess Arianna s entanglement could lead to an ill consequence similar to what appeared to have happened earlier with Lord Siege as briefly alluded to by his lament over his earlier involvement with Tashia

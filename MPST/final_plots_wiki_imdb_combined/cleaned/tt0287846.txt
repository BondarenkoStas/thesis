Dracula s Guest The short story Dracula s Guest was posthumously published in 1914 two years after Stoker s death
It was according to most contemporary critics the deleted first chapter from the original manuscript and the one which gave the volume its name but which the original publishers deemed unnecessary to the overall story
Dracula s Guest follows an unnamed Englishman traveller as he wanders around Munich before leaving for Transylvania
It is Walpurgis Night and the young Englishman foolishly leaves his hotel in spite of the coachman s warnings and wanders through a dense forest alone
Along the way he feels that he is being watched by a tall and thin stranger
The short story climaxes in an old graveyard where the Englishman caught in a blizzard takes refuge in the marble tomb of Countess Dolingen of Gratz
Within the tomb he the Countess apparently asleep and healthy but before he can investigate further a mysterious force throws him clear of the tomb
A lightening bolt then strikes the tomb destroying it and incinerating the undead screaming countess
The Englishman then loses consciousness
He awakens to find a gigantic wolf lying on his chest and licking at his throat however the wolf merely keeps him warm and protects him until help arrives
When the Englishman is finally taken back to his hotel a telegram awaits him from his expectant host Dracula with a warning about dangers from snow and wolves and night
Deleted ending A small section was removed from a draft of the final chapter in which Dracula s castle falls apart as he dies hiding the fact that vampires were ever there
As we looked there came a terrible convulsion of the earth so that we seemed to rock to and fro and fell to our knees
At the same moment with a roar which seemed to shake the very heavens the whole castle and the rock and even the hill on which it stood seemed to rise into the air and scatter in fragments while a mighty cloud of black and yellow smoke volume on volume in rolling grandeur was shot upwards with inconceivable rapidity
Then there was a stillness in nature as the echoes of that thunderous report seemed to come as with the hollow boom of a thunder clap the long reverberating roll which seems as though the floors of heaven shook
Then down in a mighty ruin falling whence they rose came the fragments that had been tossed skywards in the cataclysm
From where we stood it seemed as though the one fierce volcano burst had satisfied the need of nature and that the castle and the structure of the hill had sunk again into the void
We were so appalled with the suddenness and the grandeur that we forgot to think of ourselves

The film is set in Nazi Germany in 1942
An Aryan family the Meißners and a Jewish family the Silbersteins are neighbors and friends
The respective sons in each family Heinrich Meißner and David Silberstein discreetly take piano lessons together
The deportation of the Silbersteins to a concentration camp is imminent and when Heinrich asks why they may have to go soon Frau Meißner does not tell Heinrich the truth
She instead invents a story that the Silbersteins will go to a new place called Toyland
Heinrich says that when the Silbersteins go he wants to go with them so that he can still be with his friend David which terrifies Frau Meißner
The morning the Silbersteins are taken away for deportation Heinrich is found missing from his room
His mother Marianne Meißner begins to search for Heinrich
She encounters ridicule from Gestapo officers after she explains her situation because they think that she is Jewish
However after she shows her papers that prove that she is Aryan they accept her story about Heinrich and assist in searching for him
The search continues until the last moment before the train with the Silbersteins on it must leave
When the train doors are opened Marianne calls out to Heinrich
The crowd moves aside and Marianne sees a boy she thinks is Heinrich hugging the Silbersteins but instead it is David
A flashback shows that when the Silbersteins were taken away Heinrich was not allowed to join them
Marianne realizes that Heinrich is not with them but to save his life calls out to David as though he is Heinrich
The Silbersteins let go of him and all continue the ruse that David is Heinrich
David returns to the Meißners home where he is raised with Heinrich as their own son

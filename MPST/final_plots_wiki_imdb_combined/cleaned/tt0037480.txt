The cartoon opens on a Valentine note to Toots from Tom with a pink ribbon tied to Jerry inside a gift box
Meanwhile Tom gets ready for a date his whiskers in curlers
Tom knocks on the door rings the doorbell and shouts before dropping the box and hiding behind a pillar on the porch
Toots opens the door and is pleasantly surprised at the gift
Tom then attempts to impress Toots by playing a ukulele and dancing
Finally Tom presents her with a bouquet of flowers but a loose floorboard smacks him in the face
Toots responds with a dissent while Jerry nods in agreement to her words
After she throws the gift back at Tom Jerry grabs an ear of corn and plants it in the box signifying that Tom s efforts were corny
Tom then hears a radio commercial for a zoot suit which gives Tom an idea to make his own zoot suit and mystify his intended
On his knocking on the door again Toots is now shocked to see Tom in the impressive outfit
Tom lights a cigar as Toots compliments his new hip look before inviting him inside
They start to jive dance and Jerry politely cuts in dancing a few steps with Toots before Tom realizes what s going on
Tom chases Jerry who escapes by jumping into an ashtray and rubbing a burning cigarette butt on Tom s nose
Jerry then peels a banana and throws the skin onto the floor which sends Tom crashing into a piano
But he recovers in majestic form and starts to play taking on the persona of a suave romantic lover
Tom tries to impress Toots using a Charles Boyer esque voice
Jerry then sticks matches in Tom s toes and lights them in order to give him a hot foot
Tom unwittingly continues until the flames engulf his feet
He pauses sniffs the smoke filled air and then realizes what Jerry has done and screams in pain
Jerry resumes dancing with Toots
Tom returns determined to flatten Jerry with a fireplace shovel
A chase ensues
Jerry hides behind a table leg and uses his foot to trip Tom
Jerry clips the hanger in Tom s jacket to a window shade then kicks Tom in the eye
Tom angrily pursues the fleeing mouse but the shade rolls back taking Tom with it
By the window Tom is dunked in a fishbowl
This causes the zoot suit to shrink and eventually pop off his body
Jerry jumps into the shrunken suit which is now a perfect fit for him
He then dances away pleased with his new zoot suit

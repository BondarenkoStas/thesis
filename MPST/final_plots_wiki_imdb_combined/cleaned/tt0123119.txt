This special begins when Linus calls the Brown house and Sally picks up
She gets very excited that her Sweet Babboo is on the other line
He denies that he is that and tries to ask if Charlie Brown is home but while he is doing so she asks if he called to ask her to a movie
He gets furious and yells at her saying he will not be taking her to a movie and wants to talk to her brother
She misinterprets that and tells him she will be waiting outside for him to pick her up
She then gives the phone to Charlie Brown
Linus tells Charlie Brown he has something important to tell him and that he will be over right away
When he arrives he tells him they will have to move due to his father s job transfer
He is shocked to hear this
Lucy then goes to Schroeder to tell him the same thing Linus told Charlie Brown and she gives him a double sided picture of her so that he will always remember her
He however does not take her seriously and says that he would want to forget her if she leaves
Charlie Brown then sadly watches the movers take the Van Pelts things and load it into their trucks
He then goes to Lucy s psychiatry booth and tells her he will be miserable without Linus
She then yells at him and reminds him that she is also leaving
She then shows him the booth s new owner who has changed its cost from 5 cents to 50 cents
Linus then tells Charlie Brown that he is playing his last baseball game with him later on
Lucy then walks over to the Brown house and finds Sally waiting out in front saying she is waiting for Linus to take her to the movie
Lucy tells her that they are moving so he will never pick her up but she refuses to believe that
Linus then invites Charlie Brown to his and Lucy s going away party
He asks Sally if she wants to come but she insists that Linus is going to pick her up and take her to a movie
The Van Pelts going away party is catered by Snoopy who feeds everyone dog biscuits and dog food with water which causes everyone to leave disgusted
The next day Linus and Lucy say their tearful goodbyes to Charlie Brown
As they are pulling out Linus throws Snoopy his security blanket as a way to remember him
After the Van Pelts leave Charlie Brown sadly walks home
When Charlie Brown gets home Sally is sitting on the porch still waiting for Linus to take her to a movie
Charlie Brown tells her that he and his family moved away
She angrily walks inside
Then Schroeder comes by to ask where Lucy is and Charlie Brown tells him that she and her family moved away
He says that he thought she was kidding then grows upset and says I never got to say goodbye
The next day Charlie Brown tells Peppermint Patty that he is upset over Linus moving away
She tells Marcie that they have to help him get over his sadness
Marcie asks her if she likes him and she naturally denies it
She walks home trying to convince herself that she could not like a loser like him
That night while Patty is trying to sleep she thinks Charlie Brown is probably feeling bad for himself and decides to call him to make him feel better
When she calls him Charlie Brown is so tired that he does not seem to be listening to what Peppermint Patty is saying
Patty invites him on a date to the movies but makes it seem as if Charlie Brown is asking her instead
She says she would go with him to a movie then hangs up and goes to sleep feeling good about herself
Charlie Brown then suddenly wakes up and wonders what he was doing by the phone thinking he just dreamt he was talking to Peppermint Patty
The next day Peppermint Patty is waiting for Charlie Brown to pick her up for their date
Marcie goes to him at the wall and asks why he looks so tired
He tells her that for some strange reason he woke up at midnight by the phone after dreaming he spoke to Peppermint Patty
She realizes what is happening and tells Peppermint Patty that he is not coming
She does not believe her and continues to wait
Later that day Peppermint Patty calls Charlie Brown because she is angry that he did not show up for their date
She continues to bother him but says she will not take revenge on him and when they hang up he says I never know what s going on
Sally expects a phone call from Linus and Charlie Brown reminds her that Linus moved and that even if he was still here he wouldn t be calling her
Charlie Brown then shows her a postcard from him which only reads about her Have you seen any good movies lately
making her livid
Charlie Brown notices moving trucks in front of the Van Pelt house again
He looks to see what is going on and he is excited to find Linus
He tells him his father did not like his new job and they are moving back
Just then Lucy gets out of the car and says What kind of a neighborhood is this
It didn t change a bit while we were gone to which Linus says Oh yeah
She s back too before Snoopy throws Linus his security blanket back

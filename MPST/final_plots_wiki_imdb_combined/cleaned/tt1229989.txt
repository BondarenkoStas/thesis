Ramiro Lalo Padilla is the director of the media company High Five editor of the famous magazine Don and has many women around him
Romina who is in love with Lalo decides to punish his lack of commitment to her
She hires a witch to cast a spell on him which turns him into a very beautiful woman as Romina wanted him to know what it is like for a woman who is being harassed
Lalo awakes as a woman in a state of utter confusion
However Lalo s friend Graciela Neira believes what happened as she heard Romina s phone call to Lalo s home saying what she did
As it seems unlikely anyone else will believe that Ramiro has been magically transformed so Ramiro assumes a new identity Dolores Lola Padilla cousin of Lalo
Lalo had to make an urgent trip to Germany because his father became ill and has appointed Lola to take his place
While trying to find a way to change back there are a whole new set of challenges to face that Lalo didn t have to experience before both within and outside the workplace

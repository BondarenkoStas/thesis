A dysfunctional and sometimes violent romance happens between Mathieu a middle aged wealthy Frenchman and a young impoverished and beautiful flamenco dancer from Seville Conchita played by Carole Bouquet and Angela Molina
The two actresses each appear unpredictably in separate scenes and differ not only physically but temperamentally as well
Most of the film is a flashback recalled by Mathieu
The movie opens with Mathieu travelling by train from Seville to Paris
He is trying to distance himself from his young girlfriend Conchita
As Mathieu s train is ready to depart he finds that a bruised and bandaged Conchita is pursuing him
From the train he pours a bucket of water over her head
He believes this will deter her but she sneaks aboard
Mathieu s fellow compartment passengers witness his rude act
These include a mother and her young daughter a judge who is coincidentally a friend of Mathieu s cousin and a psychologist who is a dwarf
They inquire about his motivation for such an act and he then explains the history of his tumultuous relationship with Conchita
The story is set against a backdrop of terrorist bombings and shootings by left wing groups
Conchita who claims to be 18 but looks older has vowed to remain a virgin until marriage
She tantalizes Mathieu with sexual promises but never allows him to satisfy his sexual desire
At one point she goes to bed with him wearing a tightly laced canvas corset which he cannot untie making it impossible to have sexual intercourse
Conchita s antics cause the couple to break up and reunite repeatedly each time frustrating and confusing Mathieu
Eventually Mathieu finds Conchita dancing nude for tourists in a Seville nightclub
At first he becomes enraged
Later however he forgives her and buys her a house
In a climactic scene soon after moving into the house Conchita refuses to let Mathieu in at the gate tells him that she hates him and that kissing and touching him make her sick
Then to prove her independence she appears to have sex with a young man in plain view of Mathieu
After this Conchita attempts to reconcile with Mathieu insisting that the sex was fake and that her lover is in reality a homosexual friend
However during her explanation Mathieu beats her causing her bandaged and bruised state seen earlier in the film
Just as the fellow train passengers seem satisfied with this story Conchita reappears from hiding and dumps a bucket of water on Mathieu
However the couple apparently reconcile yet again when the train reaches its destination
After leaving the train they walk arm in arm enjoying the streets of Madrid
Later in a mall in Paris loudspeakers announce that a strange alliance of extremist groups intends to sow chaos and confusion in society through terrorist attacks
The announcement adds that several right wing groups plan to counter attack
As the couple continues their walk they pass a seamstress in a shop window mending a bloody nightgown
They begin arguing just as a bomb explodes apparently claiming their lives

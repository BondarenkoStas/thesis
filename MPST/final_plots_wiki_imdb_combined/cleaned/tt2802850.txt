Dealership mechanic and paroled ex convict Shep Proudfoot refers Jerry to Gaear Grimsrud
Jerry travels to Fargo North Dakota towing a new car from his dealership and hires Gaear and Carl Showalter to kidnap his wife Jean and extort a ransom from his wealthy father in law and boss Wade Gustafson in return for the dealership car and half of the 80 000 ransom
Jerry pitches Gustafson a lucrative real estate deal and he agrees to front 750 000
Jerry considers calling off the kidnapping then learns that Gustafson plans to make the deal himself giving Jerry a finder s fee
At Jerry s home Carl and Gaear carry out the kidnapping
As they transport Jean to their remote cabin on Moose Lake a state trooper pulls them over outside Brainerd for driving without temporary tags
When the trooper hears a sound from the back seat Gaear kills him then chases down two eyewitnesses and kills them
The following morning Brainerd police chief Marge Gunderson discovers that the dead trooper was ticketing a car with dealership plates
Later two men driving a dealership vehicle checked into the nearby Blue Ox Motel with two call girls then placed a call to Proudfoot

While in Minneapolis Marge reconnects with Mike Yanagita an old classmate who tells her that his wife another classmate has died and makes an awkward pass at her
Jerry informs Gustafson that the kidnappers have demanded 1 million and will deal only through him
Meanwhile Carl in light of the complication of three murders demands that Jerry hand over the entire 80 000
GMAC gives Jerry 24 hours to prove the existence of the vehicles or return the loan
Carl is attacked and beaten by a furious Proudfoot for involving him in the murder investigation
Carl orders Jerry to deliver the ransom immediately
Gustafson insists on making the money drop himself
At the prearranged drop point in a Minneapolis parking garage he tells Carl he will not hand over the money without seeing Jean
An enraged Carl shoots and kills Gustafson
After fleeing the scene Carl is astounded to discover that the briefcase contains 1 million
He removes 80 000 to split with Gaear then buries the rest alongside the highway
At the cabin Gaear has killed Jean Carl says they must split up and leave the state immediately but after a heated argument over who will keep the dealership car Gaear kills Carl
Marge learns that Yanagita s dead wife is not dead nor his wife
Reflecting on Yanagita s convincing lies Marge returns to Gustafson s dealership
Jerry continues to insist that he is not missing any cars
Marge asks him to inventory the lot then spots him driving away from the dealership and calls the State Police
The next morning she drives to Moose Lake on a tip from a local bar owner who reported a funny looking guy bragging about killing someone
Outside a cabin she finds the dealership car nearby Gaear is feeding Carl s dismembered body into a wood chipper

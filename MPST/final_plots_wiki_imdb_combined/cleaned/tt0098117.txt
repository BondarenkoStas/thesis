The story is set in rural Shropshire during the Napoleonic Wars
It is narrated by the central character Prue Sarn whose life is blighted by having a harelip
Only the weaver Kester Woodseaves perceives the beauty of her character but Prue cannot believe herself worthy of him
Her brother Gideon is overridingly ambitious to attain wealth and power regardless of who suffers while he does so
Gideon is set to wed his sweetheart Jancis but he incurs the wrath of her father the cruel and scheming self proclaimed wizard Beguildy
An act of vengeance by Beguildy makes Gideon reject Jancis and tragedy engulfs them both
Prue is wrongly accused of murder and set upon by a mob but Kester defies them and carries Prue away to the happiness she believed she could never possess because of her harelip
The setting for the story has been attributed to the Meres of northern Shropshire but is more likely to have been the area around Bomere Pool which was closer to the author s own home at Spring Cottage on Lyth Hill
These locations remained very rural at the time the novel was written and Mary Webb was herself very much part of local country life there in the 1920s
Webb uses the rural setting to isolate Prue Sarn and her fellow characters from the larger world at one point Prue tells us four years went by and though a deal happened out in the world naught happened to us
The title of the story has a double meaning
It is taken from John Milton s Paradise Lost Let none admire That riches grow in Hell that Soyle may best Deserve the precious bane
It refers to the love of money which as Prue records blights love and destroys life
But the title also refers to Prue s deformity which she comes to recognize as the source of her spiritual strength
In one of the most moving passages in the book she relates there came to me I cannot tell whence a most powerful sweetness that had never come to me afore as if some creature made all of light had come on a sudden from a great way off and nestled in my bosom
Though it was so quiet it was a great miracle and it changed my life
If I hadna had a hare lip to frighten me away into my own lonesome soul this would never have come to me
Even while I was thinking this out of nowhere suddenly came that lovely thing and nestled in my heart like a seed from the core of love

A year after delivering Christmas presents Santa Claus receives a letter from his friend Father Time asking for help to find Happy the Baby New Year before midnight on New Year s Eve or else it will be December 31 forever
Santa sends Rudolph out to find him
An evil vulture called Eon the Terrible is supposed to live for exactly one Eon after which he will turn into ice and snow and disintegrate
As his particular Eon will end January 1 of the New Year he plans to kidnap Happy to keep the year from ending and stop time thus preventing his predestined death
Father Time speculates that Happy who ran away due to his big ears being laughed at is hiding out in the Archipelago of Last Years where the Old Years retire and rule over an island styled to resemble the year over which they ruled
Sent to assist in this journey are some agents of Father Time including General Ticker The Great Quarter Past Five and Big Ben
Upon arrival in the Archipelagos Rudolph first travels to the island belonging to a caveman named One Million B C

O M
inhabits an island anachronistically inhabited with friendly dinosaurs and other prehistoric and long extinct creatures
As Rudolph and his friends search for Happy they repeatedly encounter Eon
After other off screen visits to the islands of 4000 B C 1492 1893 and 1965 have been completed without success Rudolph and O M
head for the island of 1023 belonging to a knight named Sir 1023 whose island is filled with medieval trappings along with several fairy tale and Mother Goose characters
Meanwhile Happy managed to befriend the Three Bears but becomes saddened when he removes his hat and exposing his big ears to them causing him to leave again
The group then travels to the island of 1776 which reflects Colonial America and is ruled over by Sev who resembles Benjamin Franklin
Following Happy s seeming rejection on the Island of 1776 Eon kidnaps him and takes him to his lair on the Island of No Name which is said to be located due north of the North Pole
The group now leaves the Archipelego in pursuit
Catching up to Eon they attempt to rescue the baby
However Eon thwarts them by sending an avalanche down on the group and trapping them inside giant snowballs
Managing to melt his way free using his nose Rudolph climbs up to Eon s nest where he finds Happy who refuses to leave
Rudolph shows Happy his nose and tells him his own story of being bullied because of his nonconformity before asking Happy to let him see his ears
Happy does so and Rudolph like everyone else before him laughs at the sight
Happy once again gets upset but Rudolph explains that the sight of Happy s ears had made him feel so wonderful that he had to laugh out loud just like it had done with everyone else
With this declaration Happy shouts out with joy but causes Eon to awaken
Rudolph quickly tells Happy to take off his hat and leave it off for good
At the sight of Happy s large ears Eon bursts into uncontrollable laughter which sends him tumbling down the side of the mountain and into the three remaining snowballs freeing O M 1023 and Sev
Rudolph realizes that Eon is now so full of warmth and happiness that it would be impossible for him to turn to ice and snow
With Santa s help they return to Father Time s castle with Happy just in time for the beginning of the new year which is designated Nineteen Wonderful
After the celebration everyone wishes Happy a happy new year and Rudolph proclaims to the viewers that it may be shiny too

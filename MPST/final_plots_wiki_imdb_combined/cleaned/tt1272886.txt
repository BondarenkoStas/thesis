Franklin Franklin is a hairless overweight eccentric social misfit and compulsive hoarder obsessed with Switzerland who walks around wearing little more than briefs and mismatching socks and lives on a diet consisting of Moxie soda and pickles with mustard
Living alone in an almost bare apartment in a rundown building complex in Southern California populated with other eccentrics including cynical stoner Tommy Balls neurotic geriatric recluse Mr Allspice and aspiring dancer Simone who lives with her mother both of whom may or may not be prostitutes
At an earlier point Franklin s landlord Mr Olivetti accidentally died after slipping on spilled mustard caused by sneezing fits when receiving fellatio from Franklin over frequent unpaid rent
In an effort to get rid of Olivetti s body Franklin takes it to Olivetti s house and tries to stage it as a suicide implementing an unlikely over array of suicide methods
Attempting to dump Olivetti s pickup truck in the outskirts of town results in Franklin being robbed and assaulted by two very dimwitted muggers
The next day Franklin wonders why he hasn t gotten his weekly audiotape from his institutionalized brother Bernard whom Franklin almost idolizes as Bernard is handsome charismatic and popular and included Franklin in his social life
Unknown to Franklin Bernard has died of an inoperable brain tumor and among Bernard s effects is an envelope holding a key to a locker containing a recorded message revealing that Bernard stole from his employer and has left Franklin a savings in a Swiss bank account and a passport in a new identity
Meanwhile fire investigator Burt Walnut and other detectives examine Olivetti s body and quickly conclude that it s staged due to Franklin s amateurishness and put a lookout for his pickup truck
Walnut visiting the apartment complex meets Balls and Allspice and becomes suspicious of Franklin
Walnut is estranged from his wife and learns that Allspice s wife died around the time as Olivetti s wife 13 years ago
Working at his convenience store Balls shatters Simone s dancing dreams with his brutal honesty upset she hides in the restroom
Balls is then held up by Franklin s muggers who shoot Balls in the torso when startled by Simone
Franklin returns to his apartment but seeing the police keeps on driving
Walnut discovers that Allspice has committed suicide and when answering a phone call by Franklin is asked to adopt Franklin s dog
Walnut informs Franklin of the muggers arrest calling them Olivetti s murderers remarking of Olivetti that some might say that he had it coming to him
Although innocent Franklin takes his Switzerland flight sitting next to Dr Sage Mennox a self help author whom Bernard obsessed over
Franklin tells Dr Mennox that his brother had died and was not insane but had actually been impaired by a fatal brain tumor the size of a racquet ball
Mennox is taken off guard by this and Franklin slyly remarks that they would be stuck together in this awkward situation for the duration of a very long flight
Ultimately Franklin is seen in Switzerland standing in front of the Matterhorn mountain surrounded by three attractive Swiss women in Swiss folk costume

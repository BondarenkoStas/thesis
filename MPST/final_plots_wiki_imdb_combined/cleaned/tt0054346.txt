Captain Harry Lewis of the British East India Company is investigating why over 2000 natives are missing but encounters a deaf ear from his superior Colonel Henderson who is more concerned with the local English merchants caravans which are disappearing without a trace
To appease them Henderson agrees to appoint a man to investigate and Lewis believes it will be him
However he is sorely disappointed when Henderson gives the job to the newly arrived oblivious Captain Connaught Smith the son of an old friend of Henderson s
Lewis believes a gang is murdering both the men and animals of the caravans and then burying the bodies and suspects that the culprits have secret informants among the merchants of the city
He presents Connaught Smith with his evidence and his theories but is dismissed
He is also later caught by the Thugees and sentenced to die by the bite of a cobra but is rescued by a pet mongoose forcing the cult s high priest to release him
However Connaught Smith remains antagonistic and derisive towards Lewis who eventually resigns his commission in frustration to investigate on his own
Meanwhile the merchants decide to band together and create a super caravan whose size as they believe will discourage the bandits
Ram Das Lewis houseboy believes he has seen his brother Gopali who disappeared some years ago and receives permission to search for him
Lewis later learns that Ram Das has been captured by the Thugs when his severed hand is tossed through the window of his bungalow soon after the Thugs compel Gopali Das a new initiate of the cult to kill his brother
The hidebound Captain Connaught Smith leads the caravan and foolishly allows the stranglers to join them
That night the Thugs strike with their usual success Connaught Smith survives only until the Thugs start burying the bodies whereupon he is killed too
Lewis and Lt Silver a cult member investigate the caravan s disappearance
Lewis sees the scar that marks Silver as a Thuggee follower of Kali and shoots him in self defence
Lewis then discovers the buried bodies and goes to the cult s outdoor temple where he is caught and set to die on a burning pyre
Gopali Das however now haunted by his brother s death at his own hands frees Lewis who casts the high priest onto the pyre instead and the two men escape in the ensuing tumult
Lewis and Gopali race to meet Patel Shari the merchants local representative who is dining with Henderson
Gopali identifies Patel s chief servant as a Thug Patil kills his follower to hold his tongue thereby exposing himself
Following this Lewis resignation is revoked and he receives a promotion from Henderson for his help in exposing the Thuggee cult
The film ends with a narrative display detailing that the Thugee cult was subsequently wiped out by the British and a quotation by Major General William Sleeman If we have done nothing else for India we have done this one good thing

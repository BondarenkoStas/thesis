American father Elliot Wade obtains ownership of the Dolly Dearest factory in Mexico
Not far from the factory lies the underground Mayan tomb of Sanzia or Satan on Earth
An archaeologist breaks into the sarcophagus but is crushed by the stone slab that covers the entrance and the malevolent spirit of Sanzia that has been trapped inside for hundreds of years is released
Upon its escape Sanzia takes refuge in the porcelain moppets of Dolly Dearest
Despite the demise of the archaeologist the sale is finalized and the unsuspecting Wade family travels from Los Angeles to Mexico to see their new home
Upon arrival the family meets their realtor Mr Estrella and housekeeper Camilla After having the luggage unloaded Estrella decides to take Elliot to see the factory and seven year old daughter Jessica asks to go with to no objection of her father
Jimmy decides to tag along as well
The building long abandoned is covered in dust and spiderwebs and structurally unstable to the consternation of Elliot but Estrella hurriedly brushes his worries aside and discusses the history of the factory
During the conversation Jessica goes exploring
On a high shelf she discovers many well preserved dolls covered by a sheet
She asks her father if she may have one and he acquiesces
Outside Jimmy finds the entrance to the cave which is blocked by a wire fence
Unaware of recent events Jimmy inquires about that area but his father warns him to never go back there again
However he does not listen
That night Marilyn tucks Jessica in bed and wishes her good night
As she falls asleep Dolly slowly turns her head to stare at the sleeping child
The next day when Jessica goes outside to play with Dolly Marilyn finds a disturbing drawing that she believes Jessica drew
Although curious Marilyn does not confront her
As the day progresses Marilyn begins to experience unusual activities
In the beginning she hears phantom footsteps
As time progresses Camilla sends a priest to bless the house
During the session the Wade family is driving back to their house and Jessica throws a tantrum in the car
Upon reaching their home the Priest is seen walking away and Marilyn successfully calms her daughter
Jessica demands that she be given her Dolly immediately and as the family walks into the house she looks back and glares at Camilla
Camilla becomes suspicious
That night Marilyn recounts the day s events to Elliot but he seems unworried
However Jessica becomes progressively more violent and obsessive with Dolly
To not arouse her father s suspicion Jessica acts normal when he is around but resumes her evil and threatening behavior around her mother
Camilla believes the doll is controlling Jessica
When the daughter speaks harshly in Sanzian tongue Camilla s suspicions are proven correct and she tries to warn Marilyn of the evil but is killed by the spirit
The mayhem continues as Jimmy sneaks out the house one night and breaks into the factory from an unlocked window
He finds the night watchman Luis dead on the floor and flees
It appears as if Luis died from a heart attack but in truth the dolls had come to life and toyed with him for a while
Struggling to escape his hand got caught in an active sewing machine
He was able to break free but the sight and shock of the wound was too much
As he was dying the dolls made haughty giggles nearby
While Marilyn listens to Jimmy pontificate upon his newly acquired knowledge of the Sanzian civilization she comes to the realization that Jessica may truly be possessed and tries to take the doll from her daughter
Jessica warns her mother not to touch the doll but when Marilyn persists Sanzia momentarily possesses Jessica and shouts I WILL KILL YOU
before adding The kid s mine
The next day Marilyn visits the dig for the first time and talks with the archaeologist Resnick about the purpose of their dig
Resnick tells Marilyn that they are searching for the remains of the Sanzia devil child inside the tomb which hasn t been opened yet
Resnick continues to explain that the devil child a true force of evil fed on the warm blood of children
The tribe eventually killed the creature because its dietary needs almost wiped out the population of the tribe
Marilyn then explains that Jessica is being controlled by her doll and visits Camilla s sister a nun at a convent
The nun already knows about her plight but informs her it s too late
Not giving up Marilyn decides to take matters into her own hands
At home Marilyn looks for Jessica
Moving stealthily around the house she is frightened by a creaking door behind her
She turns to see Jimmy hiding of the floor of the hallway closet
Jimmy tells her that he s hiding and that Jessica and Dolly are in Jessica s room
He also reveals that he s seen Dolly talk and move
When he mother begins to wonder aloud where the key to Jessica s room is Jimmy hands it to her and she heads to Jessica s room
In the room Dolly reveals its true self to Marilyn
They exchange words and the battle begins
The mother goes back downstairs loads ammo into the shotgun and tells Jimmy to call his father
At the factory the dolls take the phones off the hook
Back at the house Jimmy informs his mother that the line is busy but she tells him to keep trying
Marilyn returns to Jessica s room to find the doll gone
It becomes a game of cat and mouse
While the mother is battling Jimmy continues to try to contact his father
When he cannot get through he decides to call the operator
Unfortunately he is unable to communicate because he doesn t speak Spanish so he hangs up and aides his mom
When Jessica becomes separated the mother snatches her up and the family runs for the front door only blocked by Dolly who is holding the car key
Marilyn warns Dolly to move but Dolly calls to Jessica and says Jessica let s play with Mommy
Jessica attacks their mother
The shotgun slides on the floor toward Jimmy who stands there stunned
As the mother and daughter struggle Dolly starts advancing towards them with a kitchen knife
Jimmy clutches the shotgun and after figuring out how it works aims it at Dolly
Before pulling the trigger he says Play with this bitch
The impact of the bullets sends Dolly crashing through the door and Jessica becomes herself again
Marilyn Jessica and Jimmy get in the car and drive to the factory were Elliot is being attacked by the dolls
Meanwhile the professor enters the tomb and sees the remains of the devil child which has the body of an infant and the head of a goat
Realizing the myth was true the professor runs to the factory where he saves Elliot from the dolls
They run outside and reunite with Elliot s family but the professor comes back with dynamite to destroy the factory and they plant it around the factory
The dolls try to stop them but fail and the factory starts to explode killing the dolls
As the explosions continue an agonizing demonic scream is heard implying the evil Sanzia spirit is destroyed
The film ends as the family watches the factory burn

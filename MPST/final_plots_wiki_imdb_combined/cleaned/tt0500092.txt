The series focuses on Lain Iwakura an adolescent middle school girl living in suburban Japan and her introduction to the Wired a global communications network which is similar to the Internet
Lain lives with her middle class family which consists of her inexpressive older sister Mika her emotionally distant mother and her computer obsessed father while Lain herself is somewhat awkward introverted and socially isolated from most of her school peers
But the status quo of her life becomes upturned by a series of bizarre incidents that start to take place after she learns that girls from her school have received an e mail from a dead student Chisa Yomoda and she pulls out her old computer in order to check for the same message
Lain finds Chisa telling her that she is not dead but has merely abandoned her physical body and flesh and is alive deep within the virtual reality world of the Wired itself where she has found the almighty and divine God
From this point Lain is caught up in a series of cryptic and surreal events that see her delving deeper into the mystery of the network in a narrative that explores themes of consciousness perception and the nature of reality
The Wired is a virtual reality world that contains and supports the very sum of all human communication and networks created with the telegraph televisions and telephone services and expanded with the Internet cyberspace and subsequent networks
The series assumes that the Wired could be linked to a system that enables unconscious communication between people and machines without physical interface
The storyline introduces such a system with the Schumann resonances a property of the Earth s magnetic field that theoretically allows for unhindered long distance communications
If such a link were created the network would become equivalent to Reality as the general consensus of all perceptions and knowledge
The increasingly thin invisible line between what is real and what is virtual digital begins to slowly shatter
Masami Eiri is introduced as the project director on Protocol Seven for major computer company Tachibana General Laboratories
He had secretly included code of his very own creation to give himself absolute control of the Wired through the wireless system described above
He then uploaded his own brain conscience consciousness memory feelings emotions his very self into the Wired and died a few days after leaving only his physical living body behind
These details are unveiled around the middle of the series but this is the point where the story of Serial Experiments Lain begins
Masami later explains that Lain is the artifact by which the wall between the virtual and material worlds is to fall and that he needs her to get to the Wired and abandon the flesh as he did to achieve his plan
The series sees him trying to convince her through interventions using the promise of unconditional love romantic seduction and charm and even when all else fails threats and force
In the meantime the anime follows a complex game of hide and seek between the Knights of the Eastern Calculus hackers whom Masami claims are believers that enable him to be a God in the Wired and Tachibana General Laboratories who try to regain control of Protocol Seven
In the end the viewer sees Lain realizing after much introspection that she has absolute control over everyone s mind and over reality itself
Her dialogue with different versions of herself shows how she feels shunned from the material world and how she is afraid to live in the Wired where she has the possibilities and responsibilities of an almighty goddess
The last scenes feature her erasing everything connected to herself from everyone s memories
She is last seen unchanged encountering her oldest and closest friend Alice once again who is now married
Lain promises herself that she and Alice will surely meet again anytime as Lain can literally go and be anywhere she desires between both worlds

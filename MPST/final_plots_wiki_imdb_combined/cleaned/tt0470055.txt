A group of friends Amy James Zach Lauren Dan and Dan s new girlfriend Michelle go for a weekend cruise on Dan s new yacht
Amy and James also bring their infant daughter Sarah
Most of the friends decide to jump into the water for a swim
Amy who is hydrophobic after a childhood incident refuses but Dan picks her up and dives in with her
However nobody thought to lower the ladder to re board the ship and so everyone aboard is trapped in the water with only two masks a dive knife and a toy dolphin float
Despite their efforts the side of the yacht is too smooth to climb and the deck is too high to reach
They see a boat of teenagers heading towards them
The group try to grab their attention but the teenagers think that they are just greeting them and sail off
During the struggle the group try using a phone to call for help only to hear the voices of some well wishers unable to get the caller s attention
The phone accidentally gets knocked in the water
They are left to tread water disconsolately
The group resorts to removing and using their bathing suits to make a rope
After a couple of attempts they manage to get one end of the rope wrapped around a railing
Instead of having the lightest person climb up Zach attempts to climb
He pulls himself up and his fingers brush the gunwale but the makeshift rope rips apart as he is too heavy
The group are now mostly naked and have only a partial rope
Meanwhile James goes underwater and is fooling around with the prop in an attempt to remove it and use it as a grappling hook but he drops the knife
He swims down after it and manages to catch it and desperately tries to swim for the surface
As he swims back up he crashes into the bottom of the boat and is knocked unconscious
He resurfaces motionlessly and slightly bloodied with an apparent skull fracture
Zach gets the knife from James and starts stabbing the boat to climb back up
Dan tries to stop Zach but accidentally stabs him causing Zach to drop the knife
In a fit of hysteria and fearing that sharks will be attracted by the blood Michelle begins to swim away but sinks underwater
Dan swims after her and sees her lifeless body drifting underwater
He dives after her but he can t reach her and her body disappears into the depths
After some time Zach dies from blood loss in Lauren s arms
She reluctantly lets go of his body which floats away face down
After much waiting Lauren says she refuses to die treading water and attempts to swim back to shore to find help
Her fate after this is unknown
Later that night during a rainstorm James dies from his head injury
Dan unsuccessfully searches underwater for the knife
He slams his mask on the hull in frustration and the lens pops out
Remembering Zach s attempt with the knife Dan uses it to wedge in the crevice of the side door for the ladder giving him a handhold
Amy climbs over his shoulders finally stepping onto his hand wrapped around the lens and manages to grab the gunwale and pull herself back on board
Once on board she lowers the ladder for Dan and tends to her baby Sarah
Amy notices Dan swimming away to drown out of guilt
She jumps back in to save him reminding her when she saved her father in the same manner at a young age
The next morning a fishing boat approaches the yacht and notices the lowered ladder and life ring still floating in the water no one had pulled them in
The yacht appears empty except for the sound of Sarah crying on the lower deck
The film cuts to Amy standing on the boat in the sun looking around looking heartbroken
Dan is shown lying face down on the boat with a towel covering his lower half seemingly sleeping

The 1999 film features De Niro as Walter Koontz a homophobic New York police officer who suffers a stroke that leaves him partially paralyzed and with a severe speech impairment
His doctor recommends singing lessons to help him improve the clarity of his speech
Too ashamed by his impairment to seek out a professional voice coach he turns for help to his neighbor a flamboyant pre operative transsexual who is also a drag performer
In the course of their interactions they discover that although they are each deeply prejudiced against one another they also have a great deal in common The film begins with Walt Koontz playing squash with a group of people in the local court when somebody sneaks up to an enclosed area beneath the court where there are people perhaps dealing drugs
The guy comes and nicks all the money that is spread across the table while the men are away and escapes only for the group of men to return and instantly relaise that the money has been taken and they quickly leave and start to chase him Walt finishes his game of squash and leaves the court where he then walks into town to his apartment where he meets a group of drag queens whilst waiting for the lift they look over his shoulder and mimic about something he is holding
Walt gets fed up and decides to take the stairs while they take the lift
While this is happening the two men are still chasing the guy who stole the money from their hidden den under the squash court
Walt walks up to his room and talks briefly to the next door neighbor when in his room he shouts out the window abusively to the Rusty Zimmerman and friends opposite to turn down their music down in a very impolite way using homophobic language
Walt closes his window and at this point the Rusty Zimmerman and her friends decide to sing even louder at their window The two men have lost sight of the guy who stole the money and swear whilst in a little side alley where he is hiding and holding his breath they then walk away back onto the main street Walt then gets ready to go out whilst at the same time you see Rusty Zimmerman getting ready and doing their make up who he then bumps into in the lift
Walt opens the door to the lift and is blown a kiss and decides to take the stairs Rusty Zimmerman talks to the apartment manager Leonard Wilcox about how there was a rat in the room and it ran across the rug and that someone should check the apartment tomorrow although as far as we know this is just an excuse as we see two people run up the stairs one of them being the guy who stole the money at the beginning of the film and the other being Amber
Leonard has a suspicious look on his face and immediately picks up the phone and you hear the dialing tone
A girl names Cristal is waiting at the top of the stairs and makes Amber and the guys she is with run up the stairs even faster they enter the room opposite to her
Once in the room Amber puts the chain on immediately whilst he pants heavily Walt has walked from the apartment to a nearby restaurant where he walks in whilst smoking a cigar to the sound of soft jazz music playing on the piano inside he is greeted when he enters the door and continues up the stairs
He walks past a couple dancing and looks around the room before someone introduces him to his dance partner Sally
Walt walks across the room where the room and walks towards two women who are sitting down and then walks over to the dance floor with one of them when he then begins to dance along slowly to the jazz music on the dance floor and the other people in the room all watch
We then see people get out of a cab and it drive off while they enter Femmes Fatale where a drag queen who goes by the name of Butsy Rutsy and described on the poster outside as our hostess with the mostess is on stage this evening
Butsy Rutsy invites a guy from the audience on to the stage where they have banter and the audience whoop and giggle Butsy Rutsy then asks him to kiss her ass and then to go and sit back down
Butsy Rutsy then invites her Big Ol Number Amazing Grace onto the stage and she comes on whilst the piano is playing and begins to sing Back in the restaurant a lady comes up to him while he waits for his dance partner to return and she questions why Walt didnt ask her to dance instead
The conversation ends before Karen returns and Walt takes her arm in his Whilst at the apartment Walts dance partner discusses how she is running short on her rent again
Walt glances at Karen then gets out his wallet and walks over to her handing her some money for her rent that she takes and leans in for a kiss
Karen says to Walt how she will see him next week he leaves the room and Karen begins to count the money again Two men open the foyer doors at the block of apartments whilst another guy walks through and gives Leonard money in his hands
Leonard looks rather scared and breathes quite worryingly whilst looking out into the distance
Upstairs Cristal and the guy she is with sit smoking in their room the men come up the stairs whilst one of them burns out the candle in the hallway the other climbs out the window and the last pulls out a gun
Two of them break open the door to Ambers room and storm in pointing the gun at the two of them in bed and the third man joins them after appearing from the window in the room
They are after him because he stole the money and start talking in Spanish asking him to give them the money he doesnt act straight away so they shoot him and lots of shouting is going on Walt hears the loud noises grabs his gun from his bedside table and heads out to find out what all the loud noise is about
Amber screams they shoot her and Walt is on his way to the scene when he feels dizzy and slowly collapses on the stairwell
Walt groans and someone rolls down the stairs past him and there is a lot of movement and flashing lights which might be reflecting how Walt is feeling or what he is seeing at this moment in time
The police appear at the scene and start talking to Walt but he does not respond
Walt Mr Koontz is driven to hospital and put on a heart monitor machine and Doctor Nirmala lets him know he has had a stroke Rusty Zimmerman was a friend of Amber and goes to identify the body whilst the men are still in the apartment searching for the money they have had no luck finding anything
Leonard comes into the room and the men insist on looking in Cristals room that is in the apartment across the hall
Cristal hears them and takes the opportunity to pack some things into her bag and escape out of the window
Rusty Zimmerman sits on the metro on the way home holding a small square postal package
Back at the hospital Mr Koontz is assisted whilst putting his jacket on and Doctor Nirmala says to him that a volunteer will drive him home and he says he will go home alone
Walt turns up at the apartment doors and some people see him struggling and ask if he needs any help
Whilst in his room Walt gets frustrated trying to do things on his own and smashes something and starts crying
He continues to cry and points a gun at his head and sits in the chair miserably and soon enough puts the gun down Rusty arrives home to find the house in a state and as soon as the door closes one of the guys grabs hold of him and the other points a gun
The package he was holding on the metro home we find contains Ambers ashes when one of the guys rips it open hoping to find the stash of money
Once they have left Rusty puts the ashes in a small little trinket box Doctor Nirmala knocks on the door at Mr Koontz apartment and Ambers friend hears the knocking and looks out the window to see Walt sitting in his chair
Doctor Nirmala has come to see him because he did not turn up at the hospital for his therapy and wants his situation to improve so suggests somebody coming to see him instead of him having to go out The men break into Cristals room and comment on the smell and how she has their money Walt is downstairs doing his laundry when Rusty starts a conversation with him he looks over but does not comment
She then offers to help Walt with Walts washing but Walt does not want help so pushes away and falls over in the process Rusty Zimmerman and her group of friends walk to the gay and lesbian center to sign up to a contest when another group of people walk in and start arguing and fighting over who is going to win the contest
They then get help to get them kicked out A policeman named Tommy Walsh knocks on the door wanting to see Walt and his physical therapist answers the door on his behalf
Tommy seems to be a good friend of Walt and says he is a hero and goes on to tell Le Shaun how he saved him another guard names Joe and 14 hostages in 1998
Tommy hears the music and signing from the group of girls opposite so decides to shout out the window and tells them impolitely to shut up
Tommy is on his way out when he tells Walt that Amber and her boyfriend stole off of Mr Z Once Tommy has gone Le Shaun talks to Walt and discusses how he has sad success with stroke patients improving their speech by having singing lessons because it relaxes you and recommends Lady Uptown as he has one of her cards in his bag Walt finally leaves the house and calls a taxi immediately the taxi pulls up and Walt slips on the ice
Someone comes running out the foyer to help and the taxi driver also gets out the cab to assist
Walt knocks on Rustys door and asks if he could pay for singing lessons but this doesnt go down too well seeing how badly Walt has spoken to his neighbors previously
As Walt walks away Rusty opens the door and asks if Walt can pay cash Walt doesnt respond so instead she says that she will call from the window when she is ready Cristal stands smoking in the road with a group of her friends when Mr Z entourage spot her she runs away and slips over where they catch her and ask her for Mr Zs money Walt turns up at Rustys house for his singing lesson
After being greeted with some humor Walt sits down ready for his lesson and starts by reciting the four musical scales
After trying this Walt says he has had enough when he struggles to pronounce the fa note he pays his money and walks towards the door
On the way out they have a little dispute between each other and shout horrible things at each other
Rusty feels bad and decides to go downstairs and knock on Walts door until he answers
They have a few words and sooner or later they are back having singing lessons
The singing teachers friends storm in the door whilst they are having their singing lesson and she asks them to be as quick as they can politely and they head off for some pizza
Walt goes home and hears the arguing and shouting from Rustys house peaks at the door and closes it Mr
Pogo pays Leonard cash for his stay and also asks about paying for parking a motorcycle him and his girlfriend go out The next day Walt goes back for another singing lesson and brings up the shouting he heard from her house last night
She gets a phone call and not long after says to Walt that the singing lessons need to end Mr
Zs entourage arrives in the foyer and Leonard lets them know that Mr Pogo has returned
They walk towards the back of the building where he has parked his motorbike and asks Mr Pogo where he got his money
He is pushed to the ground and beaten they then smash the lights on his new bike and hurt Tasha too
He tells them that he has been dealing dugs and Tasha knew nothing about this so takes off his motorbike jacket and chucks it at him storming off Walt opens his door to see what all the noise was about it is Rusty staggering up the stairs
Walt walks out to the stairs to see if she is ok Walt goes to Rusty and comforts her whilst chatting over a drink
Rustys ex boyfriend turns up wanting money while Walt is still at her house and they both walk into the other room and lock themselves in there Walt was invited to Vinnies but they knew he wouldnt come so they turned up at his to play a game of cards
Tia knocks on the door and Tommy answers it for Walt she brings him flowers and tape of his favourite tango songs
Tia makes Walt put down his stick and takes his hand to dance and leans in for a kiss
Walt finds it strange that Tia is here and he has no money so he questions her and this results in her leaving sooner than she probably planned to Walt goes back to Rustys for another signing lesson and she congratulates him for graduating his signing classes and has made him a tape to practice on his own
Rusty tells him to come back tomorrow at 5pm Leonard turns up at his mums house and Mr Z grabs hold of him
Mr Zs entourage has taken his mother while he deals with Leonard Walt turns up at Rustys and they have hosted him a graduation party
The pizza guy from downstairs appears with pizza and he joins in with the party until his dad comes up looking for him
Once the party is over Walt and Rusty have a deep chat together
Seeing as they are sharing their confessions Miss Dusty tells Walt that she has spent Mr Zs money on her outfit
They began arguing again and ended on a bad note Back at the motel Leonard leaves the room to open a latter privately and leaves the building putting the letter in the inside pocket of his jacket Walt appears back at the Jazz restaurant where he spent a lot of his time at the beginning of the film and before his stroke
He turns up with some flowers the tango music starts and he asks Rita to dance Rusty and her friends are at the Flawless contest and the other girls get annoyed that they did not win
The same people who started the fighting at the gay and lesbian centre earlier on in the film When Walt returns back to the motel Leonard tells Walt to not take any notice of anything he hears or sees tonight
Rusty arrives back from the Flawless contest and Mr Z is in her apartment with his entourage
Mr Z asks Rusty where the money is and he pulls out a letter and says that the 25 000 deposit and more says differently
Here we find out the letter Leonard opened earlier was a letter addressed to Rusty regarding her operation
Mr Z punches Rusty around the face and she crashes down to the floor Going against what Leonard said earlier Walt slowly tries to get up out of bed and looks out of his window to see Mr Z and his entourage beating Rusty
Walt slowly walks to Rustys door and opens the door quietly and points the gun in and shoots
They fire back and shoot Walt Rusty kicks the entourage and runs over to Walt and one of guys chases her
Rusty runs out the room and down the stairs he grabs her leg and pulls her back down the stairs
Rusty grabs her high heel and whacks him around the head Mr
Z asks Walt where the money is and he tells him its in the bedroom where he then locks himself in there as he knows from previously that the steel door will help him keep safe
Mr Z and one of the guys try to break into the bedroom
Rusty comes back up to her house to find them at the door of her bedroom shouting stop
In the pouring rain Rusty uses the fire escape exit and climbs along the walls and stairs to try and get to the rear window of her bedroom where Walt is laying down worriedly as the stomping noises are getting louder and the lock will not stay on forever
Rusty makes quite an entrance by falling through the window
Mr Z finds a stash of money and Walt pulls out a gun Mr Z demands he puts it down otherwise he will shoot
Rusty reaches for her nail file and stabs Mr Z in the leg while he screams in agony Walt takes the opportunity to shoot him
Walt is taken to the hospital in the back of an ambulance and Rusty goes with him

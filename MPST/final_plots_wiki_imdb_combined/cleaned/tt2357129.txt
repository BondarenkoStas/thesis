The film opens in 2001 with a middle aged Steve Jobs introducing the iPod at an Apple Town Hall meeting
It then flashes back to Reed College in 1974
Jobs had already dropped out due to the high expense of tuition but was still attending classes with the approval of Dean Jack Dudman who took him under his wing
Jobs is particularly interested in a course on calligraphy
He meets up with his friend Daniel Kottke who is excited to see that Jobs is holding a copy of Be Here Now by Baba Ram Dass
Influenced by this book and his experiences with LSD Jobs and Kottke spend time in India
Two years later Jobs is back in Los Altos California living at home with his adoptive parents Paul and Clara
He is working for Atari and develops a partnership with his friend Steve Wozniak after he sees that Wozniak has built a personal computer
They name their new company Apple Computer though there already is a company called Apple Records that is owned by The Beatles
Wozniak gives a demonstration of the Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club
Jobs is later approached by Paul Terrell who shows interest in the Apple I
Knowing that he and Wozniak will need a studio in which to build them Jobs convinces his father Paul to allow them to use the family garage for his new company
Realizing that they cannot build these computers alone Jobs also recruits Kottke Bill Fernandez and Chris Espinosa to the Apple team
Terrell however is disappointed by the Apple I a reaction which inspires Jobs to start again with a second model
He hires Rod Holt to reconceptualize the power supply for what would be called the Apple II
In addition after many failed attempts Jobs finally wins the interest of a venture capitalist Mike Markkula who also joins Apple
They release the Apple II at the 1977 West Coast Computer Faire where it is a remarkable success

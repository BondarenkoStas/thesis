Joe Pendleton a backup quarterback for the American football team Los Angeles Rams is looking forward to leading his team to the Super Bowl
While riding his bicycle through the older west side of tunnel one on Kanan Dume road in Malibu he collides with a truck
An over anxious guardian angel known only as The Escort on his first assignment plucks Joe out of his body early in the mistaken belief that his death is imminent and Pendleton arrives in the afterlife
Once there he refuses to believe that his time was up and upon investigation the mysterious Mr Jordan discovers that he is right he was not destined to die until much later
Unfortunately his body has already been cremated so a new body must be found
After rejecting several possibilities of men who are about to die Joe is finally persuaded to accept the body of a millionaire industrialist
Leo Farnsworth has just been drugged and drowned in his bathtub by his cheating gold digger wife Julia Farnsworth and her lover Farnsworth s personal secretary Tony Abbott
Julia and Tony are naturally confused when Leo reappears alive and well
Leo buys the Los Angeles Rams to lead them to the Super Bowl as their quarterback
To succeed he must first convince and then secure the aid of long time friend and trainer Max Corkle to get his new body in shape
At the same time he falls in love with an environmental activist Betty Logan who disapproves of the original Farnsworth s policies and actions
With the Rams about to play in the Super Bowl the characters all face a crisis
Mr Jordan informs Farnsworth that he must give up this body as well
Farnsworth resists but hints to Betty that she might someday meet someone else and should think of him
Julia and Abbott continue their murderous plans and Abbott shoots Farnsworth dead
The Rams are forced to start another quarterback Tom Jarrett in the climactic game
A detective Lt Krim interrogates the suspects while they watch the game on TV
With the help of Corkle he gets Julia and Abbott to incriminate one another
After a brutal hit on the field Jarrett is himself killed
With Mr Jordan s help Joe then occupies his final body
He is shown snapping to life in Jarrett s body then leading the Rams to victory
During the team s post game celebration Mr Jordan removes Joe s memory of his past life and departs
Joe becomes Tom Jarrett and the cosmic balance is restored
The one left crestfallen is Corkle who understands what really happened
Jarrett bumps into Betty while leaving the stadium
They strike up a conversation and Betty suddenly experiences a realization who he really is

It is 1974 and life is not easy for a black male to find employment even college educated Jim Ellis
While struggling to find anything better Jim a former competitive swimmer is working on the decrepit Marcus Foster Recreation Center operated by the Philadelphia Department of Recreation
The center includes a dilapidated swimming pool which Ellis rehabilitates
Ellis s presence and activities cause friction with a bitter overprotective janitor named Elston
One day Jim invites a group of black teens who have just been thrown off the basketball court in the Center s yard in for a swim
Andre Hakim Reggie Puddin Head and Walt prove to be fairly capable swimmers and with a few pointers could become great swimmers
With some help from Elston Jim decides to try to save the swimming pool by starting the city s first all African American swim team the P D R
team
When the team acquires Willie a female swimmer more talented than any of the boys the prospects of competing against much more experienced white teams begin to improve
Jim also develops a romantic interest in a beautiful city councilor Hakim s sister and guardian
Throughout their struggles in and out of the swimming pool Jim and Elston encourage and mentor the kids helping them not only to become successful at swimming but also in their struggles against prejudice crime and poverty

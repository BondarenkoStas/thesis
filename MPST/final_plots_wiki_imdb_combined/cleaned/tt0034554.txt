The cartoon begins with a mother buzzard instructing her children to go out and catch something for dinner
They set off right away except one with his back turned
This is Beaky Buzzard who is shy and a little on the slow side
Against his will his mother kicks him out of the nest with instructions to at least catch a rabbit
Beaky spots Bugs Bunny and soars down to catch him
Bugs makes like an air traffic controller and guides Beaky to the ground with a crash
After some heckling a chase ensues ending with Bugs crashing into the ground underneath the skeleton of a dead animal
He cries because he thinks he s dead but it turns out he knew he was okay the whole time
Beaky and Bugs jitterbug together
Bugs says Why don t we do this more often to which Beaky replies Ya mean just what we re doing tonight
This is a quote of the first line of the song Why Don t We Do This More Often
After the dance with Bugs Beaky ends up underground with the skeleton above
He screams Oh MA
and his mother shows up
At first the mother buzzard thinks Bugs did something to Beaky
Bugs pulls Beaky out of the ground
Noticing that Beaky is unharmed the mother abandons her desire to eat Bugs and declares him her hero and kisses him
A blushing Bugs imitates Beaky

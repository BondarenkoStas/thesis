Andula is a working class young woman living in a fading Czech factory town where due to an oversight in central state planning women outnumber men 16 1
The film opens with an intimate scene between Andula and her fellow shoe factory worker friend as they lie in bed in their dormitory discussing the ring given to Andula by her boyfriend Tonda and gossiping about her mildly flirtatious encounter with a forest ranger which is shown in flashback
The factory supervisor belatedly realizes that the gender disparity is impairing morale and productivity so he arranges for an army officer to organize military maneuvers near the town in order for the factory to sponsor a big dance at which the workers can find male companionship among the soldiery
They need what we needed when we were young he explains to a sympathetic officer
Anticipation runs high on both sides with the girls expecting to meet the young men of their dreams while the recruits many of whom are actually middle aged reservists out of shape and already married look forward to a night of revelry and seduction
The night of the party is a disappointment for some members of both groups Andula and her friends are repulsed by the unappealing soldiers whom they call old buffers and a trio of reservists are so nonplussed by the situation that they commit a series of comic faux pas like sending a bottle of wine to the wrong table and dropping a wedding ring that one of them is trying to hide only to watch it roll across the floor and land at the feet of the young women who are the objects of their lust
For these people the mixer is a huge flop with the girls retiring to the lavatory to devise a way to escape their pursuers and the aging reservists arguing with each other over expenses and speculating on the necessity of going to the woods in order to consummate their romantic plans
For others however the dance is a success the factory supervisor looks on in smug satisfaction as couples throng the crowded dance floor one girl holds her hands together in a gesture showing her delight and gratitude when she is asked to dance while an obese balding soldier capers with a mismatched tall thin brunette both clearly having the time of their lives
Andula strikes up a flirtation with Milda the big city pianist of the band providing the music
He reads her palm and instructs her in how to rebuff unwanted advances with a kick in the shins
After the party she goes to bed with Milda although the comic frustrations continue with Milda fighting a battle with a window shade that won t close before he feels secure in making love
Afterward as they lie in bed together Andula asks what Milda meant when he said she was angular
He replies that a woman is shaped like a guitar And you you look like a guitar too he tells her but one painted by Picasso
Before they part he offhandedly invites her to come to Prague and pay him a visit sometime
Although she hears nothing from Milda after their night together she still expects to reunite with her dream man shortly so she breaks off with Tonda who storms the dormitory demanding his ring back
After listening to a speech by the housemother on the virtues of fidelity and commitment she packs up her suitcase and arrives on Milda s doorstep in the big city ready to resume their romance
Milda is not home and she meets his parents who have never heard of her and don t know what they should do with her
Milda comes home very late and after an evening of comically painful tension and uncertainty his parents decide it s only decent to put the girl up for the night on the sofa requiring Milda to climb into bed with them in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety
Forman has described this famous scene It s a tight fit
The old man wants to sleep the son would like to get thrown out so he can join the girl on the couch but the mother runs the show and won t tolerate any such filthy ideas under her roof
Andula kneeling outside the door of their bedroom overhears the family squabbling and when it becomes clear to her that she is not valued in the least she breaks down in tears and the next morning returns to her home
She tells her friends about her wonderful trip to the capital and how nice Milda s parents were to her especially his father and then she returns to work at the factory

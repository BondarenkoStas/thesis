The action takes place in Illyria a fictional Eastern European country during the latter stages of World War II
The country an ally of Nazi Germany is on the verge of being annexed to the Eastern Bloc
A young Communist Hugo Barine is told that Hoederer a party leader has proposed talks with non Socialist groups including the Fascist government and the liberal and Nationalist led resistance
The idea is to set up a joint resistance group opposing the Germans and plan for a post war coalition government
Hugo feels that Hoederer s policy smacks of treachery
Louis another party leader has decided that Hoederer must die
He grudgingly agrees to let Hugo who has more commitment than experience do the job
Hugo and his wife Jessica move in with Hoederer who is charming and trusting by nature
Hugo becomes his secretary
Although he tries to convince Jessica that he is in earnest about the murder she treats the whole thing as a game
Indeed at first she sees the gun not as a murder weapon but as a metaphor for a phallus as Hugo perhaps suffers from erectile dysfunction and is unable to please her
Ten days pass and then the negotiations begin with the other parties
With Hoederer coming close to a deal with the members of the class that he loathes Hugo is on the point of reaching for his gun when a bomb explodes
Nobody is killed but Hugo is furious
This attack shows that those who sent him do not trust him to do the job
He gets drunk and almost gives the game up to Hoederer s bodyguards
Jessica covers up for him by claiming to be pregnant
Olga Lorame one of those who sent Hugo to commit the murder discreetly visits him and Jessica
It was she who threw the bomb and warns Hugo to get on with killing Hoederer since the others are getting impatient
So far Jessica has looked at the killing as a game but the bomb convinces her that things are in earnest and that Hugo will kill Hoederer
She persuades the two of them to argue their points out in order to prevent any killing
Hoederer s plan is to enter government with the other parties but to leave them with the key ministerial posts
Once the war is over a number of unpopular but necessary policies will have to be implemented in order to rebalance the economy
This will cause problems for the right wing government allowing the left wing including the Communists to take over more easily
At the moment the Communists do not have the necessary support to gain power and the expected arrival of the Soviet forces may only make things worse
Hoederer points out that people do not like occupying foreign armies even liberating ones and the feeling will be passed on to the government introduced by the invaders
Hugo insists that the party must remain pure
Power is the goal but Hoederer s expedient methods are not acceptable especially as they involve collaborating with class enemies and lying and deceiving to their own forces
Once they are alone Jessica tries to convince Hugo that he was taken in by Hoederer s point of view but he twists this around saying that it is all the more the reason to kill Hoederer since he could convince others
Over time however both Hugo and Jessica have succumbed to Hoederer s charm and manner
Although he disagrees with Hoederer s policies Hugo seems to think that Hoederer could help him cross from boyhood to manhood and sort out his internal conflicts
Hoederer who is now aware that Hugo is there to kill him on Louis orders is willing to help the young man sort out his problems
He is not however so keen on Jessica whose attraction to him seems more physical
When he kisses her as a way of getting it out of her system Hugo catches them in the act and kills him
While in prison Hugo receives gifts from the outside which he guesses are from those who sent him to kill Hoederer
This keeps him going but some of the gifts turn out to be poisoned chocolates
What s more when he is released on parole he finds himself stalked by the party s killers and takes refuge with Olga
Olga listens to Hugo s version of events
Hugo did not kill Hoederer out of jealousy for Jessica but because he thought that Hoederer was not sincere when he said that he wanted Hugo to stay with him in order to mentor him I killed him because I opened the door
That s all I know Jealous
Perhaps
But not for Jessica
Olga concludes that Hugo will be more useful alive than dead
However she also reveals that the policy that Hoederer proposed has been adopted after all
On Moscow s orders the party has formed an alliance with the other groups
In fact Hugo realizes that the very setup that Hoederer was negotiating in his presence and which he was supposed to prevent has been carried out
The whole thing was over a matter of timing Hoederer s initiative was too premature so the party had to kill him
Later after Hoederer s plan was adopted the party rehabilitated his image and after the war he will be remembered as a great leader and hero
Hugo is incensed especially since the party has lied and deceived its own members
The fact that they are at war and have probably saved a hundred thousand lives makes no difference
What matters now he decides is that Hoederer should die not for a woman like Jessica but for his policies because he lied to the rank and file and jeopardized the soul of the party
Hugo decides all the party leaders Hoederer Louis and Olga are alike
This is why he has been targeted by hitmen sent by Louis
Hugo realizes that despite Olga s statements to the contrary if he remains alive and continues with the party his earlier assassination of Hoederer will mean nothing and bring dishonor
Thus while Olga tries desperately to save him it is Hugo himself who lets the killers in to finish the job

High school freshman Victor Knudsen tries to think about how to fall in love for high school senior Anya Benton
When introducing himself he hiccups and a few other students including Anya s boyfriend Peter mock him
At a party that night Victor and Anya run into each other and Victor daydreams of Anya falling in love with him
The next day at school Victor overhears Peter and Marisa talking about Anya s virginity in the bathroom
Victor believes that Peter and Anya are not falling in love so he goes to her house to warn her of Peter s intentions but he instead chickens out
And that night Peter and Anya are under age drinking in her bedroom with Victor looking on through her window
Peter and Anya start making out to which Victor interrupts it a couple times by ringing the door bell and then tries to postpone Anya and Peter s hangout by washing the dishes
Peter becomes fed up of Victor s actions and throws him out of the house
However he is horrified when he opens the door to find Anya s parents arrive back home
The next day Victor receives an invitation to Anya s 18th birthday party which unbeknownst to Victor was actually made by Brian
As Victor s brother Zack and Brian want Victor s attempts to woo Anya to fail so they can successfully publish their production film they advise Victor to buy her a tarantula for her birthday present claiming that she has always wanted one
When Anya opens Victor s present the party guests panic except Anya s dad Roger who finds it hilarious
In Anya s bedroom Anya gets Victor to relax but her father informs the two they can t find Hugo and then offers Victor a ride home
Sometime later Victor apologizes to Anya and offers to take her out for lunch which she accepts much to the annoyance and confusion of Peter who originally planned a different date
Anya breaks up with Peter and Victor takes her to Pyramid Lake where they rent a row boat
While relaxing on the boat Anya says that Victor hasn t failed and kisses him
She then asks if Victor is also a virgin and when he replies that he is she invites him to come over to her house on Wednesday to have sex with him as her parents will be out playing cards
Victor goes to a drug store with the intention to buy condoms but is too embarrassed to do so
With the help of Zack Victor pays him to buy them
On Wednesday night Victor arrives at Anya s house for an intimate moment but Anya s parents arrive back home just minutes later
Anya s father requests that he have a personal chat with Victor in the kitchen
In the kitchen Roger says he realizes that Anya and Victor both like and care for each other and that it is fine with him if they want to have protected sex
The next day Anya invites Victor to hang out with her and Marisa but just as they arrive they see an unidentified girl kissing Victor
Though Victor does not know the girl Anya assumes Victor was only pretending to love her to show off to his friends
Victor tries to explain the situation but Anya runs back home devastated and abandons him
The next day Zack and Brian show Victor the film they have been making which reveals that Peter paid his cousin to kiss Victor in front on Anya and Marisa the day before
Victor then takes the film to show it to Anya however he gets into a car accident ending up in hospital whilst the DVD is crushed by the car
Anya visits Victor in hospital and apologizes that she didn t believe him about the girl who kissed him
The two make up and reconcile and Anya explains to Victor that Zack and Brian had extra copies of the film which she watched and then destroyed
Anya claims that the film was good enough to expose Peter as a cousin lover as Zack and Brian filmed Peter and Lisa kissing
Meanwhile at school all the students have downloaded the clip and laugh as Peter gets in sight
Meanwhile Zack and Brian try to make another film with them again but their camera s battery dies
During the credits Victor performs the song If Eyes Could Speak to Anya

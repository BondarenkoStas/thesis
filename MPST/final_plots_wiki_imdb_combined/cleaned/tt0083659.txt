Craig Manning is a respected doctor living in the United States who begins to experience strange visions of women being murdered
Before long he begins to suspect that these visions are the result of a psychic connection with his twin brother Keith who supposedly died in a house fire in Cleveland at the age of 17 but who is now engaged in a murder spree
Recognizing the scenery in one of the visions Craig travels to Hamburg Germany to find and stop his brother over the protests of his girlfriend Julie Warren
Meanwhile Keith is soon spotted and mistaken for Craig at a Hamburg coffee shop by ex boxer Bud Waldo one Craig s former patients
Maliciously Keith goads the older man into an impromptu boxing match striking him repeatedly and causing a fatal heart attack
Craig arrives on the scene in time to meet Waldo s daughter Christine who joins him in his search for Keith
The two quickly become lovers but their search is hampered by the local police who think Craig is to blame for Keith s murders
While they hide Keith locates them kills Christine and finally confronts his brother telling him he was aware of their psychic connection and that he committed the murders as a way of bringing his estranged brother to him
Craig condemns his actions but Keith escapes promising more murders
Shortly thereafter the police arrive and arrest Craig charging him with Christine s murder
In short order Julie arrives in Germany and certain that Craig s visions are real implores the local authorities in Hamburg to help search for Keith in connection to the murders that Craig is now being blamed for
While Craig sits in jail she concocts a plan to act as bait for Keith meeting him at a secret location and counting on Craig s psychic connection to help bring the police to her in time
Keith psychologically unstable and obsessed with his brother attempts to rape Julie but during the struggle she is able to stab him to death with his own knife
With Keith dead the charges against Craig are dropped and he is freed from prison
He continues to have visions however which seem to show Keith returning from the grave
Moreover he seems to have taken on some of Keith s personality characteristics
The film ends with some ambiguity about whether Keith is still somehow psychically affecting his brother from beyond the grave or if Craig is simply psychologically scarred from his experience

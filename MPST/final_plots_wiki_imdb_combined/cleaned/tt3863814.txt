Not all scientists believe in evolution
The 15 PhDs interviewed in this documentary do their best to explain why
Following on the heels of the publication of a book by the same title Evolutions Achilles Heels the film begins with the central mechanism of Darwinian evolutionary theory natural selection and explains why creationists have no problem accepting it as a reality
They discuss what natural selection is and what it can and cannot do before concluding that it is actually powerless to do what Darwin required
Perhaps surprisingly they conclude that natural selection is part of the creationist model of origins From there they move on to something Darwin knew nothing about genetics and make the claim that the genetic complexity science has discovered over the last few decades is very difficult for Darwinian theories to explain
They discuss briefly human ape similarities and the a correspondence between what the biblical book of Genesis predicts about human genetic history and what we find in genetic databases The next chapter is on the origin of life
This is perhaps the strongest section of the documentary
Basically they argue from what is known about experimental chemistry physics and probability to make the case that origin of life scenarios are less than scientific
Here we also find several brief humorous animations The sections on the fossil record and geologic record are too brief to be fully comprehensive and the ideas are interrelated but they do discuss transitional forms including what is expected by both sides
Here also are the first appeals to the biblical Flood at the time of Noah in way of explaining various geologic features Obviously they are getting deeper into issues with deep time so radiometric dating comes next
They summarize the methodology used discuss several important techniques and outline some of the most difficult problems they think evolutionary geologists have
These include the ubiquitous carbon 14 found in all layers of the geologic record The final scientific section is on big bang cosmology
They do not give many hints to an alternative but their list of problems with the standard big bang model is comprehensive
Whether or not one agrees with them their points are well known to the experts They wrap up the documentary with a 10 minute section on ethics and morality
While this is not a scientific discussion per se they do point out how the philosophical underpinnings of science create a situation in which science and ethics cannot be divorced

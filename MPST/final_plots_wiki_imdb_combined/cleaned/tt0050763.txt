On the way to meet his former boss railroad tycoon Ben Kimball Grant McLaine rescues a young boy Joey Adams from Concho
Ben informs Grant that his payroll has been robbed three times already by a gang led by Whitey Harbin and the Utica Kid
If Ben s workers don t get paid soon they will all leave the end of track work camp
Grant accepts the undercover job of carrying 10 000 to the crew by train
When the train is held up again Grant hides the money in a shoebox carried by Joey
The ploy works but the young boy turns out to be friends with the Utica Kid who takes him along with him
When the robbers cannot find the money Whitey takes Ben s wife Verna to hold for ransom
Concho a gang member pistol whips Grant tumbling him down the steep embankment unconscious
The train leaves without him
When Grant wakes up he trails the gang to an abandoned mining camp
He boldly asks to join up revealing that he is the Kid s older brother interestingly the Kid s given name is Lee
Utica is suspicious of his heretofore honest sibling so Whitey accepts him
Concho tries to shoot Grant unexpectedly but Grant is faster to the draw
Afterwards he tells the Kid where the money is in an attempt to reform his brother
It doesn t work
The Kid gives Grant ten minutes to leave before he tells the gang but Grant calls his bluff
Then railroad employee Will Renner shows up to collect his share of the loot
He had been Whitey s informant
He recognizes Grant as the man assigned to deliver the payroll
A gunfight ensues in and out of the barroom
Grant Verna and Charlotte Charlie Drew the Kid s girlfriend take refuge behind the bar temporarily
Grant sends Verna to safety down the mountain in an ore tram
Charlie refuses to leave
Meanwhile the Kid is planning to quietly leave with Joey and the money
However Joey rushes to Grant s side and the Kid reluctantly joins forces with his brother
They kill all the gang members except Whitey
When Whitey crawls up close and shoots at Grant the Kid steps in taking the bullet
Grant then kills Whitey
Grant buries his brother before they ride to the camp
With Grant s urging Joey gets to work on his promised job hauling water
Grant decides that his old job of railroad troubleshooter is a better fit than the offered position of being next in charge

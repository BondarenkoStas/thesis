They plan to condition the children s brains to become killers through VR training and place them inside cybernetic bodies to create new soldiers similar to Raiden
Raiden rescues George and the unharvested orphans and takes them to Doktor
Raiden promptly resigns and with Bladewolf at his side launches a one man assault on World Marshal s headquarters in Denver Colorado
Though he is no longer employed by them Maverick unofficially approves of his actions and provides discreet support throughout

Florence Carala and Julien Tavernier are lovers who plan to kill Florence s husband Simon Carala a wealthy industrialist who is also Julien s boss
Julien is an ex Foreign Legion parachutist officer and a veteran of the Indochina and Algeria wars
After working late on a Saturday with a rope he climbs up one storey on the outside of the office building shoots Carala in his office without being seen arranges the room to make it look like a suicide and then makes his way out to the street
As he gets into his Chevrolet convertible outside he glances up and sees his rope still hanging from the building
Leaving the engine running he rushes back and jumps into the elevator
As it ascends the caretaker switches off the power and locks up the building for the weekend
Julien is trapped between floors
Moments later Julien s car is stolen by a young couple small time crook Louis and flower shop assistant Véronique
Florence who is waiting for Julien at a café nearby sees the car go past with Véronique leaning out of the window
She assumes that Julien has run off with her and wanders the Paris streets despondently all night asking for him in the bars and clubs where he is known
While joy riding Louis puts on Julien s coat and gloves
Checking into a country motel the two register under the name Mr and Mrs Julien Tavernier to avoid problems for Louis who is wanted for petty crimes
At the motel they make the acquaintance of Horst Bencker and his wife Frieda a jovial German couple on holiday with whom they had raced en route to the motel
After Frieda takes pictures of Louis and her husband with Julien s camera Véronique takes the film to a photo lab beside the motel for developing
After the Benckers go to bed Louis attempts to steal their Mercedes Benz 300 SL gullwing
Bencker catches Louis and threatens him with what appears to be a gun though it is really a cigar tube
Louis shoots and kills the couple with Julien s handgun
He and Véronique return to Paris and hide out in her flat
Convinced that the crime will be traced to them Véronique persuades Louis to join her in a suicide pact
They take an overdose of pills and pass out
The Benckers bodies are discovered along with Julien s car handgun and raincoat
Julien therefore becomes the prime suspect in their murders and the morning newspapers print his picture
Searching for him the police arrive at the office building with the caretaker who unlocks the entrance doors and switches on the power
The elevator is working once more and Julien is able to escape without being seen but when he orders coffee and croissants in a café he is recognized and the police are called to arrest him
In the office building the police discover Carala s body but assume he committed suicide
However they charge Julien with killing the Benckers refusing to believe his alibi of being stuck in an elevator
Florence is determined to clear him and sets out to find Véronique
She and Louis their suicide attempt having failed are alive but drowsy
Florence accuses them of killing the Benckers and goes off to call the police
Louis at first thinks there is no evidence to connect him with the crime but then remembers the photographs of him with Bencker
Rushing off to the photo lab he finds that the police have developed the pictures and he is arrested
Florence has followed him and when she enters the lab the police show her the photographs taken with Julien s camera
These make clear that she and Julien were secret lovers who shared a motive for killing her husband
Both will go on trial for Carala s murder

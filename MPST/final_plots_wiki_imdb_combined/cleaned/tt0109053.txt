The docudrama is a partially fictionalized account of the four day Attica Prison riot in 1971 at the Attica Correctional Facility where prisoners took over much of state prison to protest inhumane conditions
The movie is focused on rookie prison guard Michael Smith and inmate Jamaal X who develop a wary friendship with each other
It is largely told through Smith who was shot four times and based on Smith s testimony
Jamaal X is based on several inmates including the inmate Smith credits with saving his life
Clarence Williams III plays the inmate Chaka one of the more ruthless prisoners who does not participate in the riot for honorable reasons
The film opens with a montage of news footage from the late 1960s and early 1970s including the assassination of Robert Kennedy students killed at the Kent State shootings and the Watts riots
The movie then shows the quiet streets of Attica New York and a 22 year old Smith in a barber shop getting his long hair cut
Smith is an expectant father who decided to become a corrections officer because of the pay
After the hair cut he goes to start his new job at the prison where black militant Jamaal X also arrives
The film shows the first day of the two men cross cutting between them
The terrible prison conditions are revealed
Prison guards treat the prisoners abusively with violence and needless strip searches and basic needs like functioning toilets are ignored
The spirit of the Vietnam war protests is influencing the prisoners to seek recognition of their human rights
Smith begins hearing of complaints of degrading conditions from increasingly politicized prisoners particularly Jamaal X a Muslim leader prominent in the fight for prisoner rights
Smith is portrayed as the only guard who treats the inmates with respect and his occasional signs of sympathy for the prisoners make his co workers suspicious of him
The seasoned prison guards like Lieutenant Weisbad do not allow challenges to their methods of complete and often humiliating control
Ultimately Smith s alliance with Jamaal saves his life
Initially Smith allows himself to dehumanize the prisoners cooperating with the inhumane treatment of the prisoners as he obeys the orders of his supervisors even if it goes against his morals
His wife Sharon expresses disappointment and contempt when she tells him You re changing
However Smith loses the willingness to follow orders during the uprising after he is beaten by prisoners in the metal shop he supervises
Several prisoners led by the psychopath Chaka were able to overwhelm the guards and take them hostage when a gate malfunctions
Jamaal protects the guards from Chaka and the other sadists recognizing they will lose the ability to negotiate with government officials if the hostages are killed
Smith refuses to humiliate himself in exchange for basic needs unlike the other captured officers
He tells his puzzled co workers I wasn t a guard long enough to learn how to be a prisoner
Jamaal comes to respect Smith for his non conformity and considers him to be a kindred spirit
Jamaal recruits Smith to speak to a news crew to testify that the hostages have not been tortured or killed
As the news conference Smith hints to Jamaal that he cares more about his own dignity than the approval of others an attitude he did not show prior to the crisis
However New York s governor ends negotiations on the fifth day of the uprising and orders a raid by law enforcement officials and soldiers
Inmates and their hostages are fired at indiscriminately as their vision is impaired by tear gas
Chaka Jamaal and Lt Weisbad are among those killed
Smith is shot several times in the stomach by a friend who is an Attica police constable
The statistics in film s epilogue convey its importance to the present
The U S prison population had risen 300 percent since the uprising surpassing South Africa as the biggest per capita in the world and this was likely to worsen with the three strikes law
Forty states were currently cited by the courts for overcrowding or other inhumane conditions

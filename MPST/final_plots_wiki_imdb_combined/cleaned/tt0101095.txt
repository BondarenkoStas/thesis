For many centuries two kingdoms have been at war at each other though neither side remembers what the war is for
In one of the kingdoms the warrior king has three daughters Catherine Caroline and Fantaghirò
Although Catherine and Caroline are well behaved princesses Fantaghirò is outspoken rebellious and longs to fight in battle
She constantly argues with her father and two sisters who disapprove of her behaviour
Fantaghirò secretly learns to fight when she befriends the White Knight a mysterious warrior whom she meets in the forest
As they are training she briefly crosses paths with Romualdo the newly crowned king ruler of the neighbouring enemy kingdom
Romualdo is enchanted by Fantaghirò s eyes but is unaware that they belong to the daughter of his sworn enemy
Romualdo is tired of the war and sends an offer of a single duel to determine the outcome
Fantaghirò s father is told by the magical White Witch that only one of his daughters can win that duel
Seeing no other option the King commands his three daughters to disguise themselves as male knights so they may fight Romualdo
Fantaghirò relishes the opportunity and cuts her hair to make her look like a boy but Catherine and Caroline are fearful
While traveling to Romualdo s kingdom the three sisters argue about the wisdom of their fighting and Catherine and Caroline decide that their youngest sister is the most qualified to win
Catherine and Caroline return to their father and Fantaghirò continues on her journey
Fantaghirò eventually meets with Romualdo who is confused when he recognises her eyes
After various attempts by Romualdo to discover her true gender by trickery they eventually battle and Fantaghirò emerges victorious
However she cannot kill him and returns home in shame
Fantaghirò s father who is proud of what his daughter has achieved forgives her
The King also allows Romualdo to continue to rule his people on the condition that he marry one of the three princesses
Although at first Romualdo is hesitant to agree when he sees Fantaghirò dressed up as a woman the two kiss happily

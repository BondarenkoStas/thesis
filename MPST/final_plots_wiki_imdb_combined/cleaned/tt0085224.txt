In the fictional town of Pottsville Idaho citizens begin disappearing
Young Michael Smith son of Marge Smith is the first to vanish
A young man is decapitated while fleeing from an unseen assailant and patrons in a drive in theater are brutally murdered inside their vehicles
At each scene a pile of green slime is found
Wanting to get to the bottom of the disappearances but afraid that the publicity might damage the town s potato business Mayor Gordon Lane hires Chemical safety engineer Garcon Jones to investigate
Also investigating the disappearances is Detective Mortimer Lutz who senses that something terrible has befallen the town
Meanwhile more and more people disappear with a puddle of green slime found at each site
With this new string of disappearances Lutz begins to suspect that Jones knows more than he is willing to tell
His suspicions grow when he is attacked by something monstrous while at home with Lutz barely managing to escape from his attacker
Lutz confronts Jones about the incident but is told that there is nothing wrong in the area
The following night while Lutz his waitress girlfriend Laurie home they are suddenly attacked by a hideous creature
After holing themselves inside a diner they manage to lock it inside a freezer
The couple then contacts Mayor Lane however when he arrives they discover that the creature has vanished leaving behind a puddle of green slime
In light of this recent attack Lutz confronts Jones again who then admits that a highly radioactive creature is responsible
It s revealed that the town is home to one of 2 000 nuclear dump sites in the U S and the creature is the resulting mutation due to repeated exposure to the site s radioactive materials
The mutant while intelligent is completely psychotic and sensitive to light and is inactive during the day
Arming themselves with shotguns the two eventually manage to track the creature down to an abandoned warehouse where they are stalked by the hungry mutant
Jones is soon attacked and disemboweled by the creature leaving Lutz alone to fend off the creature
Donning a gas mask Lutz attempts to kill the creature with poison gas but it seems unfazed by the poisonous fumes and tosses Lutz around like a ragdoll
As the creature advances Lutz manages to toss a beaker of acid into the creature s face momentarily stunning it
Taking advantage of the creature s distraction Lutz grabs a nearby axe and hacks the creature to death ending the creature s reign of terror
However a new mutation is seen bursting from the ground as the credits roll

Peter Loew is a driven literary agent who is slowly going insane
He works all day and club hops at night with little in his life but one night stands and the pursuit of money and prestige
He sees a therapist frequently and during these sessions his declining mental health becomes clear through a series of increasingly bizarre rants that eventually begin to scare even his psychiatrist
After taking a girl he met in a club named Jackie back to his place a bat flies in through his window scaring them both
At his next session he mentions to his therapist that the bat aroused him
After visiting an art museum with Jackie the next day he ditches her and she leaves an angry message on his phone
Loew meets Rachel at a night club and takes her home
She pins him down reveals fangs and feeds on him
He soon begins to believe that he is changing into a vampire
He stares into a bathroom mirror and fails to see his reflection he wears dark sunglasses during the day and when his fangs fail to develop he purchases a pair of cheap plastic vampire teeth
All the while Rachel visits him nightly to feed on his blood
He experiences mood swings and calls Jackie back apologetically asking to meet her at a bar
As he is about to leave a jealous Rachel appears and beckons him back inside
A dejected Jackie eventually leaves the bar and leaves an angry note on his door asking him to leave her alone
A subplot concerns a secretary working at Loew s office Alva Restrepo
Loew torments her by forcing her to search through an enormous file for a 1963 contract
When she fails to find the contract he at first browbeats and humiliates her then visits her at home and finally attacks and attempts to bite her at the place where they both work
She mistakes the attempt to drink her blood as a rape attempt causing her to pull out a gun and Loew begs her to shoot him
Since it is only loaded with blanks she fires at the floor to scare him off
He eventually overpowers her and mocks her rape assumption by ripping her shirt open and knocking her down
He then takes the gun and attempts to fire it in his mouth but after doing it twice the blanks do not kill him
He goes out to a club wearing his vampire teeth and begins to seduce a woman but when he gets too grabby she slaps him off but he then overpowers her and bites her neck having taken out the fangs and using his real teeth
He then puts the plastic fangs back in
Leaving the club Loew has a brief ambiguous encounter with Rachel she admits to knowing him but gives the impression that they have not been in contact for a long period
He accuses her of being a vampire and is expelled from the club
Alva wakes up with her shirt ripped open possibly thinking she was raped and eventually tells her brother about the sexual assault and he goes after Loew to seek revenge
Loew is wandering the streets in a blood spattered business suit talking to himself
In a hallucinatory exchange he tells his therapist that he raped someone and also murdered someone else
Based on a newspaper the latter appears to be true as the girl he bit in the club is announced dead
As Loew returns to his now disastrous apartment Alva points out Loew to her brother who pursues him inside his home with a tire iron
In the midst of an argument with an imaginary romantic interest he begins to retch again from the blood he had swallowed and crawls under an upturned sofa
Alva s brother finds him and upturns the sofa and Loew holds a large broken shard of wood to his chest as a makeshift stake repeating the gesture he had made earlier to strangers on the street when he had asked them to stake him
Alva s brother in a rage pushes down on the stake and it pierces Loew s chest
As Loew dies he envisions the vampire Rachel smiling at him one last time

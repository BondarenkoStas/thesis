A trailer released at E3 shows a military operation originating in Latveria home of master villain Doctor Doom
The story starts with Secret War
We re using Nick Fury s invasion of Latveria as a jumping off point
The rest of the story is derived from the consequences of those actions states Dan Tanguay creative director for Vicarious Visions
The game then follows the Civil War story arc a fight between heroes and villains causes an explosion in Stamford Connecticut killing 612 civilians
The government labels the incident super powered negligence and the public demand a Superhuman Registration Act
The government passes the act and all meta humans are forced to adhere to or disobey the law
In the game players are able to choose between the Pro Registration side headed by Iron Man and Mister Fantastic or the Anti Registration side headed by Captain America and Luke Cage
Several other characters are locked into a specific side
Songbird is locked to the Pro Registration side for the Vicarious Visions versions with Ms Marvel and Thor locked to the Pro Registration side for the n space versions
Iron Fist is locked to the Anti Registration side for the Vicarious Visions versions with Daredevil and Storm locked to the Anti Registration side for the n space versions
These ten characters are locked into their specific side but the others are playable on either side of the conflict
Multiple endings are available and are determined by the side chosen at the beginning of the game
Tanguay stated that the story follows into the aftermath of the Civil War
Plot The game begins one year prior to the main Civil War story arc
Colonel Nick Fury is leading a team comprising Iron Man Captain America Spider Man and Wolverine in addition to several other superheroes on an unsanctioned attack on Castle Doom in Latveria after discovering that the elected prime minister Lucia von Bardas was supplying weapons to the Tinkerer who in turn supplies them to super villains
The President is adamant against the attack as Von Bardas has been establishing friendly ties with them
The attack is successful and Castle Doom is reduced to rubble with Von Bardas assumed dead
The scene then shifts to present day
Ms Marvel is reported missing after being sent to recover intel on suspicious criminal activity
A team is sent to investigate and find her being interrogated by Shocker
They then uncover a plot by the Latverian military led by a cyborg Von Bardas and several subordinate supervillains to destroy New York City
The group thwarts Von Bardas plan but many city blocks are destroyed in the process prompting the government to consider the Superhuman Registration Act
In light of this incident Nick Fury disappears leaving S H I E L D
agent Maria Hill in charge
Three days later during a telecast of The New Warriors Nitro creates a large explosion killing more than 600 civilians in the process prompting the immediate implementation of the Superhuman Registration Act
Captain America opposed to the act goes underground along with several other superheroes and S H I E L D agents
At this point the story branches into two segments Anti Registration and Pro Registration depending on player choice
In order to aid them the Pro Registration group develops nanite technology and use it to mind control super villains increasing their ranks
The two story arcs converge when Iron Man fakes a hostage situation at a chemical plant owned by Stark Industries
There he attempts to negotiate with Captain America promising amnesty
Captain America refuses and a battle ensues between the two factions
The nanite controlled super villains go haywire and attack the S H I E L D
agents they were programmed to help stealing explosives to destroy the facility
Fury disguised as one of the agents enlists the help of the group to fend off Venom III and Green Goblin while he disarms the bombs
He is thwarted by Venom as he tries to disarm the final one
The ensuing explosion wounds many superheroes whom Fury rescues
The group learns that the Fury they saw was one of his androids
He manages to acquire Tinkerer s help in discovering the cause of the malfunction
The group is then sent to Prison 42 in the Negative Zone where the rebel superheroes and supervillains that have been captured are held to get a sample of the nanite formula
They collect the samples and Fury activates the self destruct system to prevent the spread of nanites
Most of the superheroes involved escape but Fury s fate is unknown
The team learns the nanites survived and have now spread worldwide
As a result the Superhuman Registration Act is suspended uniting the two teams
They split into different groups with the main group traveling to Wakanda home of Black Panther
They help him defend the country from nanite agents now under the moniker of The Fold and in the process cure Venom and Green Goblin of the nanites
They also discover that Nick Fury has been taken by The Fold
The heroes establish a base in Wakanda learning that The Fold cannot comprehend Fury s intel on it making it temporarily safe from nanite attacks
In order to stop The Fold the heroes infiltrate a base in Iceland to broadcast a nanite stasis signal that will paralyze those in its control allowing them to be cured
At the culmination of their mission the team face off against Tinkerer who was behind The Fold all along and then a nanite controlled Nick Fury enhanced with extra nanites
After defeating Fury every one who was affected is freed from the nanites
The game has one of two news based endings depending on which side the player has chosen In the Pro Registration ending the Superhuman Registration Act gets amended where the superheroes can voluntarily register without revealing their secret identities while Tony Stark becomes Director of S H I E L D
In the Anti Registration ending the Superhuman Registration Act gets repealed with the President granting full amnesty to all Anti Registration heroes
Also in both endings a banner running across the screen states that the President has pardoned Nick Fury

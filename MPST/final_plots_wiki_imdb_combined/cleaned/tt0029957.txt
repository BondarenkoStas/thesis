Lantier the human beast of the title has a hereditary madness and has several times in his life wanted to murder women
At the beginning of the story he is an engine driver in control of his engine La Lison
His relationship with La Lison is almost sexual and provides some degree of control over his mania
As a result of a chance remark Roubaud suspects that Séverine has had an affair some years earlier with Grandmorin one of the directors of the railway company who had acted as her patron and who had helped Roubaud get his job
He forces a confession out of her and makes her write a letter to Grandmorin telling him to take a particular train that evening the same train Roubaud and Séverine are taking back to Le Havre
Meanwhile Lantier who is not working while his engine is being repaired goes to visit his Aunt Phasie who lives in an isolated house by the railway
On leaving he meets his cousin Flore with whom he has had a longstanding mutual attraction
After a brief conversation with her his passions become inflamed and he is on the verge of raping her but this in turn brings on his homicidal mania
He has a desire to stab her but just about controls himself and rushes away
Finding himself beside the railway track as the train from Paris passes he sees in a split second a figure on the train holding a knife bent over another person
Shortly after he finds the body of Grandmorin beside the track with his throat cut
It was also discovered that he had been robbed of his watch and some money
An investigation is launched and Roubaud and Séverine are prime suspects as they were on the train at the time and were due to inherit some property from Grandmorin
The authorities never suspect their true motive
Lantier sees Roubaud while waiting to be interviewed and identifies him as the murderer on the train but when questioned says he cannot be sure
The investigating magistrate believing the killer was Cabuche a carter who lived nearby dismisses Roubaud and Séverine
The murder remains unsolved
Despite being cleared of suspicion the marriage of Roubaud and Séverine declines
Zola casually tosses in a remark that the money and watch stolen from Grandmorin was hidden behind the skirting board in their apartment thus confirming the reader s suspicion that Roubaud was the murderer all along

Lantier feels the return of his desire to kill and one morning leaves the apartment to kill the first woman he meets

He then realizes that he has the desire no longer
It is his relationship with Séverine and her association with the murder that has abated his desire
The relationship between Roubaud and his wife deteriorates when she realizes that he has taken the last of the hidden money
Lantier has the opportunity to invest money in a friend s business venture in New York
Séverine suggests they use the money from the sale of the property they inherited from Grandmorin
Roubaud is now the only obstacle to this new life and they decide to kill him
They approach him one night when he is working as a watchman at the station hoping that the murder will be attributed to robbers
At the last moment however Lantier loses his nerve
Cousin Flore meanwhile sees Lantier pass her house every day on the train and noticing Séverine with him realizes they are having an affair and becomes insanely jealous wishing to kill them both
She hatches a plot to remove a rail from the line in order to cause a derailment of his train

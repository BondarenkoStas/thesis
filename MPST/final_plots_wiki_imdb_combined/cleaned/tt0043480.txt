Droopy is presented here as a manservant working for an unseen master who is going away for a few days with the head butler Mr Theeves
As they are packing the master s clothes Mr Theeves requests that Droopy acquire someone to help him around the house while they are away and the first person to come to Droopy s mind is his identical twin brother Drippy
Droopy contacts Drippy at O Brien s Gymnasium and explains the situation to him
Drippy arrives later on and displays his superhuman strength by punching his way through the front door before greeting Droopy
Droopy introduces Drippy to Mr Theeves who is briefly astonished by Drippy s uncanny resemblance to Droopy immediately startledly jumping up to the chandelier thinking he was seeing double
However Mr Theeves is relieved enough to come down from the chandelier and is also on the receiving end of Drippy s immense strength while shaking his hand
Mr Theeves then explains Drippy s duties to him and tells him that no matter what no strangers are allowed on the premises
However while Droopy loads the master s suitcase into his limousine Butch the Irish Dog asks if Droopy can put him up for a little while since he has had little to no good luck recently
Droopy reluctantly agrees and has Butch go to the back door but forgets to inform Drippy
As Butch snidely muses about taking advantage of Droopy the back door opens but what Butch is unaware of is that it is Drippy who has answered
Butch promptly demands Let me have it pal and Drippy responds by punching Butch across the terrace musing No strangers
Butch gets caught in a veranda which swings him back into the door as Drippy closes it
Droopy then appears and lets a bewildered Butch inside but as Droopy fetches some food Drippy comes back into the kitchen and hits Butch outside with the kitchen table
Droopy unaware takes Spike s food outside assuming Butch wanted to eat in the patio
As Droopy goes back for mustard Drippy appears again and throws Butch down into the swimming pool leaving him dazed
Droopy then rescues Butch assuming he wanted to go for a swim and takes him inside the house
Droopy puts some dry clothes on Butch but while he goes for some shoes Drippy appears again and knocks Butch out cold
Droopy assuming Butch was sleepy tucks him in bed
Butch wakes up and begins to enjoy the comfort but when he tries to call Droopy Drippy responds instead and punches Butch into the bathroom where Droopy is shaving
Butch accuses Droopy of assaulting him but Droopy responds by recommending a cold shower for Butch
Strangely Drippy goes for a shower as well and hits Butch out stark naked
Droopy offers to get Butch some clothes but this time Butch demands that he accompany Droopy
As Droopy enters a closet to get some clothes Drippy appears from inside another right beside it and hits Butch with a baseball bat
Butch angrily demands that Droopy hand it over but Droopy denies having one confusing Butch
Each time Butch puts Droopy in the closet Drippy appears from the other and hits him
Now assuming that Droopy is responsible for hurting him Butch demands that he stop but Droopy denies having touched Butch all day
Now believing that Droopy may be going crazy Butch discreetly calls for an ambulance
When the ambulance arrives Butch calls Droopy but this time both Droopy and Drippy answer
Shocked at the sight of two Droopys Butch goes insane and got taken away by the ambulance

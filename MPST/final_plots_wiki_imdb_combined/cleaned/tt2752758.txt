After their wedding they go to the Dominican Republic for their honeymoon
During Carnival the couple meet a fortune teller who delcares Sam was born from death and repeats to Sam that they have been waiting for her
Creeped out the couple quickly leave
On their way out a strange man watches them
They get lost on the way home and a cab driver offers to take them to a local club
There are numerous strange symbols marking the area on their way there and before they enter the strange man from the fortune teller s watches them from afar
At the club the same man from fortune teller s watches them and speaks with the cab driver
Unaware they are being trapped the couple is drugged and taken to an underground chamber beneath the nightclub where a ritual is performed and an unseen force fills the room
The next morning Zach and Sam wake in their hotel with no memory of the previous night
A couple of weeks after the honeymoon Sam discovers she s pregnant despite claiming to have taken birth control pills religiously ever since the wedding
Though shocked Zach and Samantha are overjoyed and tell their family and friends the news
The couple later attend their first ultrasound scan where the doctor says that the baby looks healthy and Sam is due by the end of March
At that moment the ultrasound screen goes static but recovers after a moment
Throughout the course of her pregnancy Sam begins to experience nosebleeds stomach bruising cravings for raw meat superhuman strength telekinetic abilities and unexplained feelings of rage whenever she or the baby appear to be threatened
Also Zach and Sam keep seeing odd looking people watching them from afar
Sam becomes convinced something is seriously wrong with the baby and that they are being watched
After a second visit to the doctor a new doctor appears and performs an amnio after Sam appears nauseous
He has no answer as to the whereabouts of their original doctor and the couple is suspicious
Before the couple return home masked men who are part of the cult set up hidden cameras inside their home to monitor her progress and make sure she doesn t hurt the baby
When Sam is eight months pregnant the couple attend a holy communion at their church
Their usually friendly niece is oddly scared of Sam now and the priest who officiated Zach and Sam s wedding looks at Sam during the service and violently coughs up blood
Later at home when Zach is reviewing the communion footage he filmed he sees the mysterious cab driver from their honeymoon sitting in a pew
He visits the priest in the hospital who explains the symbol is related to summoning the Antichrist and warns Zach that the symbol is the gateway for the Antichrist and that the followers of the cult will dress the house in ash to prepare for the arrival
After he finds ash all over his house Zach chases the people watching their house and finds out where they are living
He asks his sister Suzie to stay with Sam while he breaks into the supposedly abandoned house at the end of his street where the cult is staying and there he finds the CCTV footage of his house and the missing ultrasound
He is almost caught by the cult when he goes to leave
Performing the ritual with the other cult members is the McCall s mysterious second doctor as well as the man who has been watching their house and the cult leader
Zach barely manages to escape he has to avoid the cab driver on his way out
Upon returning home Zach finds the house surrounded by the masked men who have been watching them all along
Inside he finds Suzie dead and hears Sam scream as the house is being destroyed by some unseen force
He finds Sam in the baby s nursery standing in a trance like state with a knife to her stomach
She s standing atop the cult symbol that she has carved into the floor secretly
Zach screams for her to stop but she presses the knife to her stomach anyway and there is a violent blast of light
When Zach recovers he finds Sam lying in her own blood with her stomach cut
She cries and wonders if the baby is all right before dying
Zach breaks down in grief before the cab driver and the second doctor appear
Zach begs the intruders to leave them alone but the doctor takes the baby regardless
The baby glows a deep red as he takes it from Sam s body
The cult takes his camera and tapes removing all evidence
Zach is arrested and interrogated by the police about the death of his wife and sister and disappearance of his child crimes for which he looks guilty
The ending shows another young couple on their honeymoon in Paris where the same cab driver offers them a lift

Set in the near future of 2037 many of the levels and locations are reminiscent of their current day equivalents
Banks building sites sewage works and other everyday recognizable buildings form the basis of many of the levels in Sin
One major difference in the world of SiN is the lack of a police force
Ten years prior to the game the police force collapsed due to corruption and ineffectiveness against the rising tide of crime
Private security companies have taken the police s place with some of them patrolling the streets like the former police some in charge of protecting their employer s assets
One of the companies which employ their own armed security forces is SinTek a large multi national biotechnology corporation specializing in medical and chemical research owned by the beautiful and charismatic Elexis Sinclaire
Elexis took over the company following the mysterious disappearance of her father Dr Thrall Sinclaire who founded it in 2005
The protagonist of the game Colonel John R Blade is the commander of one of the largest security forces in the city of Freeport HardCorps
Prior to the beginning of the game Blade is working to rid the streets of a potent new recreational drug named U4 which is rapidly gaining popularity in Freeport and is rumoured to be able to cause genetic mutations to its users
Yet the source of the drug is still unknown and its effects not entirely studied
As the game begins the player is placed into the shoes of John Blade as he responds to a full scale bank heist and hostage situation perpetrated by a well known Freeport criminal boss Antonio Mancini
But as the player progresses and pursues the criminal behind the heist further questions are raised Who is really behind the heist
And is this linked to the reported appearances of mutants in the city
As the game progresses it is gradually revealed that the whole bank robbery is funded by Elexis Sinclaire who in fact only wanted Mancini to steal a safety deposit box from the bank s vault
When she learns that he launched a full scale bank heist instead she injects him with concentrated U4 and turns him into a mutant sending him after Blade
John manages to defeat the huge creature and afterwards learns that it was in fact Mancini himself
Blade also finds out that the substance found in Mancini s body after his death is only manufactured by one company SinTek
All these unavoidable facts force Blade to embark on an investigation into SinTEK s vast industrial area located in the outskirts of Freeport
Later Blade learns that Elexis Sinclaire s main goal is to poison the Freeport water system with vast quantities of U4 turning all of the city s inhabitants into mutants
He manages to thwart that plan but it turns out to be just a diversion because in the meantime SinTek s troops steal nuclear warheads from a U S military base
Elexis threatens to fill them with U4 and launch them at specific targets turning the entire world s population into mutants
As Blade becomes aware of that he heads to SinTek s main base in order to stop Sinclaire
However once Blade defeats the Sintek s security and mutants at the base he reaches Sinclaire only for her to escape by transferring her entire body into a rocket that launches itself into the sky splits and spreads everywhere JC is unable to locate them in Blade s fury of the escape he smashes a button causing the nuclear missiles to abort and cancel their launching
Sinclaire disappears through the rockets never to be seen again
Throughout the missions Blade is aided via radio link by a computer expert working at HardCorps JC a skilled hacker capable of breaking into even the tightest of networks
In fact Blade had first found out about JC when investigating a cracker who had broken into the HardCorps system
After tracking down the hacker Blade recognizing the perpetrator s talents decided to make him a job offer at HardCorps instead of arresting him
Thus JC became one of the HardCorps most valuable assets and the only one able to assist them in hacking based missions

A blanket clad gunfighter the Stranger rides into a largely deserted Mexican village where he encounters Chica a young widow with a baby son and Paco a bartender who orders him at knife point to leave
After killing Paco with a bottle he witnesses a massacre of Captain Cordoba s Mexican Army troops by the bandit chief Aguilar and his gang who steal the soldiers uniforms and a machine gun
Dressed in a Union Army uniform the Stranger greets Aguilar and his dominatrix right hand woman Maria Maruka Pilar and informs them that an attachment of Union soldiers led by Captain George Stafford will soon be arriving to deliver two bags of gold coins to Captain Cordoba s troops
In return for identifying Aguilar as Cordoba to Stafford the Stranger requests a share of the gold
The plan succeeds despite Stafford s scepticism
Preparing to leave the Stranger demands a half share of the gold from Aguilar who refuses giving him only a single coin for his troubles
The Stranger creates a diversion by shooting the candles of the saloon and steals the gold
Despite holding off Aguilar s men and escaping he is forced to surrender the gold when they take Chica hostage
The Stranger later returns to recapture the gold but he is ambushed and beaten by Aguilar s men before being left to the attentions of Maruka who becomes increasingly aroused by him
Eventually killing her by bashing her head against a stone floor the Stranger distracts Aguilar and the gang by setting off an explosion allowing him to steal the gold and save Chica who has been abused by Aguilar
After tending to his wounds Chica gives the Stranger a shotgun and a sack of shells he gives her several gold coins hiding the remainder in a fountain and advises her to leave town with her baby
Before she can do so Aguilar and his men track her down and threaten to kill her baby so that she can reveal the location of the gold
The Stranger saves them by shooting one of the bandits Marinero in a prolonged battle he eliminates the gang members one by one as they search for him throughout the town
Confronting and beating Aguilar the Stranger kills him in a shotgun versus machine gun duel and places a gold coin between his teeth
Stafford s troops aware of who the Stranger is arrive to recover their gold Stafford whose real name is Ted Harrison agrees to allow him to keep half of the gold as bounty for killing Aguilar s gang
Biding George farewell the Stranger is watched by Chica as he rides out of town

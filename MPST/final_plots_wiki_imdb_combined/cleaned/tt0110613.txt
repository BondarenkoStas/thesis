Set nearly two years after the first film in the spring of 1974 Vada Sultenfuss sets out on a quest to learn more about her deceased biological mother
She has matured over the past year and a half going from the spunky eleven year old hypochondriac to a lively yet more serious teenager seeking independence
Her father Harry has since married Shelly DeVoto whom he dated in the first film and they are expecting a baby
They still live in the Sultenfuss funeral home in Madison Pennsylvania while her Uncle Phil has moved to Los Angeles where he now works as a mechanic
Gramoo Vada s grandmother has since died and she still wears the mood ring that her late best friend Thomas J died while retrieving it for her
To accommodate the new baby Vada moves out of her bedroom and into Gramoo s old room which has been renovated and it brings further problems with adjustment
Vada even thinks about getting her own apartment while spending a night out with her father
Vada is given a school assignment to write an essay on someone she admires but has never met
She decides to write about her mother but has few sources to go on which are all confined in a small box
Among its contents are programs of plays her mother was in a passport and a mystery paper bag with a date scribbled on it
Vada expresses her desire to travel someday so Shelly concocts a plan for her to travel to Los Angeles during her spring break where she can stay with her Uncle Phil and do research on her mother who lived in L A growing up
Harry does not go along with the idea believing Vada is too young to be traveling by herself and fearing what might happen to her in Los Angeles
Eventually he lets her take the five day trip
On arriving in L A Vada finds herself confronting a boy her age named Nick who comes to pick her up at the airport instead of Uncle Phil
Nick is the son of Uncle Phil s girlfriend Rose and he is asked to show Vada around the city
While annoyed at first about sacrificing his own spring break he helps Vada with the difficult search of learning more about her mother
Their relationship which starts out reluctantly gradually grows stronger
Vada and Nick meet several people who knew her mother
Some of the things she finds out don t sit well with her such as her mother being suspended from school for smoking
Two of these acquaintances have a look at that paper bag from Vada s small box of memories about her mother but neither can decipher it
When another blurts out the name Jeffrey Pommeroy thinking that he is Vada s father but of course isn t Vada is crushed and wonders why her father never mentioned this person
Eventually but with some hesitation she goes to see Jeffrey her mother s first husband
He provides Vada with valuable information to help with her assignment including home movies and the answer behind the date written on the paper bag
An a cappella rendition of the Charlie Chaplin song Smile appears in the home movies sung by her mother
Meanwhile Uncle Phil is trying to prove his love to Rose after a man who owns a fancy car that supposedly needs many tune ups tries to sweep her away
When Uncle Phil gets the courage to show what she means to him he proposes
As Vada is about to return home she and Nick share a final moment at the airport ending in a kiss
Also she receives earrings from him as a gift
When she returns home she realizes Shelly had just had a baby boy who has a crying spell
As Vada holds him she sings Smile to her new half brother to calm him the same song she heard her mother singing in the home movies
Her essay on her mother gets an A

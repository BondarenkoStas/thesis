It s homecoming at Charlie Brown s school and Charlie Brown and Linus are among the escorts for the Homecoming Queen and her court
During the Homecoming Parade Linus tells Charlie Brown that he will be the escort for the Queen but Charlie Brown is shocked when he sees the Queen is none other than the Little Red Haired Girl herself
He is even more shocked when Linus tells him about the Homecoming tradition that he has to escort Heather and give her a kiss before the first dance
Hearing this Charlie Brown hyperventilates and falls off the float
The Homecoming Game begins with Snoopy as the referee and Charlie Brown on the team as kicker
But unfortunately even in a real football game with many spectators Lucy also on the team as the placekick setter can t resist humiliating Charlie Brown again pulling the ball away just as he tries to kick it
To make matters worse even though Lucy is clearly the one at fault the team blames Charlie Brown for the failed kicks
With just thirty seconds left in the fourth quarter Charlie Brown has a chance to become a hero and kick a field goal for the win but Lucy again pulls the ball away and the team loses by only one point
Despite the humiliation Charlie Brown still arrives at the dance to the surprise of his teammates some whom think it would have been better if he didn t show up at all
But remaining faithful to his duty Charlie Brown escorts Heather to the middle of the dance floor and somehow summons the courage to kiss her on the cheek
From that moment forward everything is a composite blur with Charlie Brown having euphoric visions now that he has kissed the Little Red Haired Girl an accomplishment previously thought to be unattainable
Charlie Brown wakes up the next morning having no memory of anything that happened after the kiss
He walks to the wall his usual hangout and meets up with Linus who proceeds to tell Charlie Brown that though he might have lost the game he definitely took the honors at the dance
According to Linus Charlie Brown surprised everyone when he kissed Heather but even more so when he took to the dance floor with her and even the other girls in the court doing all of the latest dances
In essence Charlie Brown was the life of the party according to Linus
In disbelief Charlie Brown replied saying What good is it to do anything Linus if you can t remember what you did
Regardless Linus reminds him that at least it was his first kiss and the story ends with Charlie Brown smiling with quiet satisfaction

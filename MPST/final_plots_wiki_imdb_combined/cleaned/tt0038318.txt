The cartoon is set in a movie theater
Various random gags occur before the film such as one patron moving to another seat another patron taking the vacated seat and so on accelerating into a free for all
A wolf makes a pass at a sexy movie usherette gets slapped in the face then settles down for the show
While the theater is in color the films within the film are black and white
A short newsreel is narrated by Robert C Bruce
The main feature is a film called To Have To Have To Have a parody of To Have and Have Not
It includes images of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall who are credited as Bogey Gocart and Laurie Becool
In addition to recreating a few well known scenes from that film the players sometimes lapse into slapstick and interact with the theater audience
Although the theater was initially full it is eventually seen to be empty except for one patron a literal lone wolf in a zoot suit who goes ga ga over Bacall
The final gag has the wolf grabbing a cigarette that was dropped in the film and jumps off the screen and Bogie shoots him
He hands it to Bogie and it explodes covering him with blackface
Bogie suddenly adopts a Eddie Rochester Anderson voice and says Mah oh mah

Cutter s way is hard to put in a category
It s a delicate blend of thriller comedy drama conspiracy buddy movie incredibly moving acting incredible noir ish cinematography and one of the most haunting scores in cinema
Richard Bone is the aimless playboy yin to Alex Cutter s hardcore Vietnam veteran yang and Moe is Alex s cynical wife
All three drink and exist in a modest house in a Santa Barbara neighborhood in the 70 s
Until one rainy night in an alley where Bone steers his foreign convertible when the engine dies and half sees a man depositing a woman s body in a trash can
Alex takes Bone and Moe to a parade hours after Bone is grilled by detectives
That s him a weary Bone tells Cutter when oil magnate JJ Cord rides by on a white horse and this is where it takes off
Cutter enlists the victim s sister and goes on a single minded plan to extract vengeance
How this is accomplished is the wildest and poignant tale you re ever going to see and the atmosphere is Lynchian but pre Lynchian
The plot is not conventionally excuted and this a treat for the willing
Again a career best for John Heard as the intense Cutter Jeff Bridges is simply incredible and the gifted Lisa Eichorn evokes the gamut of raw emotions
Not a noir film but a cult film in every sense of the word
Well worth renting or owning
Perhaps director Ivan Passer s finest

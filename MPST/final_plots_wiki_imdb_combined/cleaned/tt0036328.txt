Having being stationed in the Philippines for years as a member of the United States Marine Corps NCO Sgt
Maj William Bailey is retired after serving for 30 years
This happens several months prior to the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor and their laying siege to the South Pacific
When the Japanese invade the Philippines Bailey confronts and strangles a Nazi secret agent who is now spreading anti American pro Japanese propaganda
The spy had posed as a religious pacifist until a devastating Japanese air attack caused many casualties against the unarmed civilians that Bailey his wife and daughter had been living among
Bailey then takes command of the local Filipino militia that he had earlier trained just prior to his retirement
They fight a series of delaying actions against a Japanese ground invasion force slowing their attack while waiting for the U S Marine island forces to arrive and counter attack
Later while wearing his one time dress blues uniform jacket he takes out an enemy machine gun emplacement as Marines blow up a vital bridge halting the Japanese advance
Sgt
Major Bailey is suddenly killed by an air bombing attack after his heroic delaying actions have succeeded
Years later at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego CA Sgt
Major Bailey is posthumously awarded by his former commander in the Philippines the corps highest medal for valor
His daughter now a Marine sergeant gratefully accepts the medal for her late father as the entire base s assembled corps passes in review

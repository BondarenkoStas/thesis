In 2010 B C on an island that would become Manhattan a large group had gathered for the funeral of a deity called Dumazu the Destroyer
An artifact called the Relic of Nilhe was broken apart and it is believed that reuniting the Relic would revive the god
In 1954 A D New York City maintenance workers unearth one of the fragments it is placed in a museum
Ismael McEnthol is admitted to the Parkview mental hospital for suffering bizarre delusions and horrifying hallucinations of Dumazu
Later Janosz Poha from the Ghostbusters II film is admitted to the hospital and is placed with McEnthol
They become friends McEnthol makes a deal that he would give him Dana Barrett in exchange for stealing the shard
After his release Janosz steals the shard while working at the museum but when he returns to Parkview he is double crossed and left in the hospital
McEnthol keeps the shard and goes under an alias Dr Michael Tesmon
Meanwhile Janosz goes insane over possessing the shard
The old Ghostbusters put an ad out and assemble a team of new Ghostbusters Alan Gabriel Bridget and Samuel
For their first assignment at the Sedgewick Hotel they track down and capture the ghost of the hotel s former head chef LeBlog
They then go to Parkview where they meet Dr Tesmon who explains that Janosz has gone insane after taking possession of the shard
The ghosts have already overtaken the hospital
The Ghostbusters analyze the shard and clear out some of the ghosts
The boss a psychokinetic construct of electro shock equipment overwhelms them After retreating to the sewers they fight against Mood Slime eventually going up against a giant one
The Ghostbusters call Geoff who drives the Ecto 4WD
The Ecto s top is a platform where the Ghostbusters can fight ghosts while the car weaves about the city streets
The car breaks down but they continue fighting
After repairing the vehicle Geoff takes them to the subway station
The Ghostbusters fight The Subway Smasher a monster formed from subway trains
After the fight the Ghostbusters learn that the monster was brought to life from an artifact shard
As the Ecto 4WD is stuck Geoff tells the Ghostbusters they walk back to headquarters to meet with the senior Ghostbusters and Janosz
The Ghostbusters take a shortcut through the St Joseph Cemetery where they encounter Snobies and gargoyles
They discover a signal that controls the gargoyles and track it down to a crop circle at the center of the graveyard where they fight a large gargoyle called a Grotesque
At the headquarters Janosz explains how he was tricked into giving his shard to McEnthol
Egon and Gabriel suspect that the shards are drawn to one another like magnets and that they can use that information to locate the remaining pieces
The next shard to find is back at The Sedgewick Hotel but pyro maniacal ghosts called Nocnitse have set the hotel on fire
The Ghostbusters work their way through the hotel and eventually capture the Nocnitse leader collecting another shard
Geoff drives the Ghostbusters back to headquarters but along the way they fight more ghosts that are attracted to the shards including gargoyles from the cemetery and the mood slime that have oozed through the cracks in the streets
The street collapses and the Ghostbusters continue on foot through the sewers where they fight Arachnid Manifestations and a Spider Queen
They also revisit a cemetery where they fight a giant Tomb Effigy that animates statues
After defeating the tomb the Ghostbusters find another shard
They return to headquarters but find to their horror that the four shards they have collected have assembled by themselves
They go back to Parkview in search of Tesmon
At Parkview the Ghostbusters fight the previous bosses
They discover that Dr Tesmon is Ismael McEnthol the Cultist seeking to reunite the Relic of Nilhe and that the boss monsters they have twice defeated were actually trying to stop him
McEnthol performs a ritual that revives Dumazu with himself as a host
He transports himself and the Ghostbusters into the Ghost World for the final battle which is against McEnthol and then Dumazu
Following the defeat of the final boss the Ghostbusters celebrate
Janosz also arrives and apologizes for his actions

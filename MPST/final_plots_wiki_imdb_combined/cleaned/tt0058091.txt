A bird strike on one of its two engines shortly after takeoff downs a Consolidated Airlines passenger jet killing all 53 passengers aboard and all but one of the crew
Pilot Jack Savage is suspected of drinking and causing the crash that leaves flight attendant Martha Webster the sole survivor of the flight
Early in the investigation it is found that the Captain shut down the aircraft s one good engine for no apparent reason and that he may have been drinking as little as an hour before the flight
The captain s wartime buddy airline executive Sam C McBane is convinced of his friend s innocence and doggedly investigates
Flashbacks deal with both Jack s past and Sam meeting him plus others they used to know
Eventually a test flight is organized as part of the investigation
Piloted by McBane its purpose is to exactly recreate in every detail the flight of the ill fated airliner
Every detail is replicated in sequence
After take off flight attendant Webster brings McBane coffee just as she did to the original flight crew
He shuts down an engine simulating the bird strike and the coffee cup tips over from sudden the loss of power spilling it contents
A short time later an emergency arises A warning light and alarm indicates there is a serious engine fire in the remaining good engine
McBane deduces that the original pilot s coffee cup was sitting atop the instrument console just as his had been
The spilled liquid leaked through the console s seams onto the electronics causing a malfunction of the airliner s engines warning system
In reality the airliner still had a fully functioning jet engine that could have prevented the crash
McBane ignores the warning and goes to full power on both engines returning safely to the airfield
A minor chance accident and the ensuing electronics fault not pilot error is proven to be the cause of the Consolidated airliner crash

The story is set in an alternate reality America circa 1985 under the authoritarian control of President Fremont
It makes liberal references to the collected works of Philip K Dick
Berkeley record store clerk Nick Brady lives modestly with his wife Rachel and their infant son
Nick has been experiencing strange visions and dreams
He confides in Rachel and his best friend science fiction writer Philip K Dick
Nick calls the source of his visions VALIS
One recurring symbol that he has been seeing is an ichthys
While he and Phil sit at a table an orbiting satellite shoots a pink laser directly into Nick s head
He rushes his son to the ER convinced that he has an inguinal hernia
The skeptical doctor is stunned to find that Nick is right
Nick has subsequent visions that tell him that he should relocate to Los Angeles where he lands a job at a record label
Philip gets visited by two members of FAP
They press him for information about Nick s visions
The female FAP agent returns and sleeps with Philip
After their liaison she pretends to be underage hoping to coerce him into revealing what Nick is seeing from VALIS
Philip refuses to divulge anything about Nick
Meanwhile Nick has a dream where a woman is singing
During the dream someone comments that there is something about her singing that seems subversive
Eventually the woman turns up at Nick s record label looking for a clerical job
She introduces herself as Sylvia and Nick just assumes that she is a singer
Sylvia gradually reveals that she also receives visions from VALIS
She explains that there are several thousand people who receive transmissions from the orbiting satellite and they are very loosely organized as a secret society
The Russian government blows up the orbiting VALIS satellite and Sylvia explains that it will take another 100 years for a replacement satellite to arrive
She writes a song with subliminal lyrics about VALIS
Nick forces The Fisher Kings to record the song despite their total disinterest in it
When they debut the song at a club Nick explains to Philip how the subliminal messages are encoded in the recording
FAP arrest Nick and Philip
They waste little time in executing Nick as well as Sylvia
The film ends with Philip in prison writing about Nick s VALIS experience
While he is working in a field one day some teenagers gawk at the prisoners and laugh
Their boombox is playing Sylvia s subliminal song and Philip realizes that the secret society found a way to get the song out despite FAP s best efforts

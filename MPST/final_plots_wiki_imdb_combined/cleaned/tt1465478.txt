Six people each of them is on the road to self destruction
They wake up in cells in a surreal facility without knowing how they got there or why
An insane criminal captures six people that have had problems in the past and makes them play a game to decide the fate of each others lives
Die is basically a PG 13 version of Saw
Die is mainly dialogue that is uninspired and pretty predictable
When I saw that Elias Koteas was one of the stars I had pretty high hopes for this movie
I feel he a great actor who isn t given enough recognition
he played in Skin walkers Shooter and many others
The movie introduces the captives one by one until they are apparently killed off
Then eventually they all wake up to find themselves in a glass prison cubes and a guy that informs them they must play a game
A game which will decide their fate
We find out that at some point in each of the six captive s lives they tried to commit suicide
So they are paired up in teams and one has to roll a die to decide what kind of chance the opposite captive has to live
For instance one guy was going to kill himself with a gun so he had to roll a die to see how many bullets had to put in the revolver
Once the number of bullets are decided he then had to squeeze the trigger while pointing it at the other captive
This was done a few times while some people lived and some didnt
Not a bad ideal for a horror flick
The back ground stories of the captives was pretty lame and not very interesting
The scenes with the villain and the captors was actually the best part of the movie
The rest of the movie was a couple of FBI agents trying to track down the kidnapped missing people
Then they had to figure out how to connect the dots that were found
It s really not too shabby of a horror flick

In the 1890s town of Silver City Iron Mike Haines is a crooked sheriff who is celebrated for his character and ability to capture bad guys
The townspeople are completely unaware that he is corrupt and that the town blacksmith Hands Weber are partners in crime and are the ones instrumental in the robbing of stages and silver mines and for framing innocent members of the population for their own misdeeds
As a result of their activities the local Carter silver mines are near bankruptcy
Bill Bradley rides into town looking for a job
He talks to Weber who send him to his ranch house with instructions to wait until he can get there later that night
In the meantime Sally Carter of the Carter mines waits in the company office with the Duchess who is then introduced so Sheriff Haines
Suddenly two of Haines s men Whitey kill Sally s uncle Horace and steal the silver that he is guarding
Haines pretends to chase the men who return to Weber s ranch house and hide out
They meet the cowboy Bradley who is angry to learn what had been done
They kill him and later Haines takes Bradley s body to town and claims that he was one of the robbers
Haines pretends to be grieved about not finding the silver however Sally is grateful for his efforts
The Duchess is afraid that Sally will lose her money and so she offers financial help while she sends for her nephew Red Ryder and his Indian Pal Little Beaver
When Red now a Texas Ranger and Little Beaver show up in Silver City Sheriff Haines son Tommy returns home having graduated from college
When Betcha and his gang try to rob a stagecoach Red thwarts their attempt
Whitey escapes and head back to the hideout but is captured by Red Ryder
However Haines fatally wounds White but in the process is himself shot by Red
Dying Haines confesses but pleads with Red Ryder to tell his son
Secretly hiding the henchman Betcha witnesses the shooting
Red returns to Silver City and tells the townspeople that Haines died serving the community in the line of duty
The citizens begin building a monument and elect Tommy as the new Sheriff in honor of his father
Hands Weber in the meantime orders his men to sabotage the mines so that Sally will finally be forced to close the operation
They set off a massive explosion however the miners agree to work for free until the next shipment of silver is made
Betcha has returned to town and has informed Hands that it was Red Ryder who killed the Sheriff
On the day of the dedication Hands passes this information along to Tommy who confronts Ryder
While they are fighting Hand s gang steals the silver shipment hiding it in a secret cellar of the blacksmith shop
Red renders Tommy unconscious and moves quickly to question Betcha
Tommy awakens and follows Red who finds the silver while Tommy learns the truth about Hand s involvement with the gang of outlaws and about his father
Tommy declares that he will have nothing to do with the dedication however he is persuaded otherwise by Red who convinces him that the townspeople need heroes and that in their eyes his father was one
When Tommy sees a young child crying because although he contributed all his pennies for the monument he cannot attend the ceremony because of his dirty uniform
Tommy allows the boy to play in the band and then dedicates the memorial to the reputation that his father had in the hears and minds of the townspeople

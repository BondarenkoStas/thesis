An unidentified stalker records video of married couple James and Amy Deakin as they hide their spare key outside their home
When the couple leaves to go jogging he uses the key to enter their home and set up hidden security cameras in each room
He also makes subtle changes such as setting their alarm to go off earlier and leaving a mix CD in their car
Amy protests when the alarm wakes her up early and the two argue over who recorded the mix CD
When James finds the audio tracks on his computer Amy considers the mystery solved but James insists that he never downloaded them
As they argue James dismisses Amy s PhD research on Afghan culture as a waste of time and she refuses to speak to him
The next morning as James leaves for work he writes her a brief apology
The stalker enters the house reads the note and records video of Amy s reaction to noise that she hears in the house
When James returns home he finds a note ostensibly written in Amy s handwriting in which she says that she has left to clear her head
James attempts to contact Amy many times but she does not answer her calls
Worried he calls her friends including Amy s sister Katherine with whom he has an antagonistic relationship
James refuses to explain the situation to Katherine and she becomes suspicious that something has happened between Amy and James
James eventually turns to his friend Alex who suggests that their childhood acquaintance Bill may be involved
James contacts Bill an Afghanistan veteran who now works nights at an animal shelter and he apologizes for tormenting Bill mercilessly during their school years
Although Bill accepts both the apology and a gift a collectable baseball he says little except that the apology does not negate the bullying
Later James comes to believe that his cat has been replaced when he receives taunting e mails and the cat exhibits uncharacteristic behavior
A police officer files a report but does not take James claims seriously
When James finds the remains of his decapitated cat and video surveillance evidence that an intruder entered his home he contacts the police again but the police remain skeptical as the cat s remains have gone missing
Convinced that the police will not act James investigates the matter himself
James receives a brief video that shows Amy bound and gagged before it deletes itself
Frustrated James demands the unseen antagonist reveal himself immediately afterward the collectable baseball is thrown through one of his windows which initiates a violent confrontation between James and Bill
Hidden video surveillance later depicts James as he digs a shallow grave
James becomes erratic and paranoid and with Alex s help he illegally purchases a handgun
Katherine becomes increasingly suspicious of James and threatens to call the police which James laughs off
James attempts to make contact with his unseen stalker who intentionally reveals himself as being in the house
After a brief chase James offers a deal for Amy s safe return James will stop investigating and not further contact the police
At work the next day James receives video footage of Amy asleep in their bed
James leaves for his house at the same time that Alex Katherine and a policeman arrive
As Katherine discovers Amy s body hidden in the basement James attempts to confront the stalker only to realize that he has been framed for her murder
While still holding the pistol James attempts to explain the situation and the police officer shoots him dead
In his home the still unidentified stalker labels his surveillance tape as 388 Arletta Avenue and sets it beside several other tapes
He then starts the cycle again with a new family

The film opens in New York
People start to get confused in Central Park repeating their words standing still and sometimes walking backwards
We hear a few screams
A woman reading on a bench takes her silver chopstick style hair pin out of her hair and stabs herself in the neck with it
Meanwhile on a building site workers on the ground are chatting when all of a sudden a body falls
Panicked thinking the worker just fell off the roof by mistake they rush over to his broken body
While they looked over the body another thud another worker
They look at him confused one is possible two is unlikely and when the third falls it seems impossible
Then yet another and another crashing to earth
When they look up they see many running off the edge apparently by their own will looking completely calm and sure of their actions In the next shot we see a science teacher named Elliot Moore talking about the event science can not explain about thousands of disappearing bees no bodies left no trace
A student offers the opinion that this is a natural event that we will never fully understand
Several students start to speculate on the phenomenon that is the disappearing bees when Elliot is suddenly called out of class to a staff meeting warning about an apparent terrorist attack in New York in which terrorists have apparently released some kind of gas in Central Park and advising that school is cancelled
As they leave Elliot confesses to his friend Julian a math teacher that he and his wife are having some problems Elliot and his wife Alma flee Philadelphia on a train with Julian and his daughter Jess
On the train people start to get reports by cellphone that the attacks have been reported at their destination and in many other places
Alma is getting repeated and insistant calls on her phone from someone called Joey and she lies to Elliot about it The movie moves on to show Rittenhouse Park in Philadelphia where a woman walks her dog and a breeze begins to blow
A traffic cop walking through a traffic jam stops and comments to a taxi driver called Sal about the chilly weather
Suddenly everyone stops in their tracks and the dog runs across the road after his leash drops to the ground leading us back to the cop who is now standing still in front of the cab
A gunshot rings out and he drops to the ground
As blood spurts from a bullet wound on his forehead the taxi driver gets out walks over to the dead cop picks up the gun from beside the body and shoots himself in the forehead as well
A woman in high heels steps off the sidewalk picks up the gun again and we hear another gunshot The train ends up leaving Elliott Alma Julian Jess and all the other passengers in a small rural town as the conductors have lost radio contact with everyone else
At a diner they see a newscast that suggests the suicides are not caused by a terrorist attack but by a natural phenomena
A reporter says that the toxin switches off the part of the brain that keeps us from harming ourselves Julian has by now lost phone contact with his wife and starts to panic as some lady shows Elliot a youtube type video she was sent on her iphone showing a man walk into a lion s den at a zoo and taunting the lions with his hands to try to get them to attack him
Julian finds a lift with some people heading to Princeton he leaves Jess with Elliot and Alma
When he gets there Princeton is also infected and there are dozens of people hanging from trees over the road
The driver of the car crashes deliberately into a tree at high speed and Julian slashes his wrists with broken windscreen glass and dies Meanwhile Elliot and Alma decide along with everybody else to flee for the state line with Jess as the attacks seem only to be affecting the northeast US
A nice couple who run a plant nursery offer to take them in their car
The man suggests to Elliot and Alma that the toxin is produced by plants
He explains the way plants can communicate with other plants and the way they can release chemicals to get rid of specific pests While trying to reach the state line they see bodies ahead in the road
Turning back they meet many other cars all converging on a country road junction all report bodies back the way they have come
Organized by an army private they abandon the cars and strike out on foot heading for a small remote housing development one man who happens to be a realtor knows about
It s new and small and not on any maps except local ones so they hope it will be safe from the terrorists since it appears they are focusing on large cities and roads From the junction one group leaves immediately but most take a minute to get things from their cars so walking across the fields they are in two groups
The smaller group with Elliot Alma and Jess is in front
The larger including the soldier and the plant couple is behind them by 3 or 4 minutes
This larger group gets infected and the soldier become delusional
Then Elliot s group hears the gunshots as one by one they use the soldier s gun to kill themselves
Elliot starts to believe that it is indeed the plants and that the toxin is triggered by large groups of people
He yells at everyone to split up into smaller groups and the group peels off into three smaller groups all running away in different directions Alma tells Elliot that if they are going to die she wants to tell him something
One night when she had told Elliot she was working late she actually went out for tiramisu with Joey from work but that s all that happened After walking for a bit Elliot counters with the fact that he finds the girl who works at the local pharmacy very attractive and sometimes he buys cough syrup from her even when he doesn t have a cough he later confesses he made this up Elliot Alma Jess and two teenagers find a showhome for the new development
There is some comic relief as Elliot talks to a plant he sees blowing inside and introduces himself saying he is giving good vibes so it won t harm him
It turns out the plant is plastic but he keeps talking for a little just in case feeling like an idiot
As they leave they look back and see two small groups of people arrive at the showhome forming one larger group
That many people trigger the toxin and they stand around confused except for one man who starts up a large commercial lawnmower then lies in the grass in front of it as it rips him apart
Our five people all end up on the front porch of a boarded up house asking for food while Jess plays on a rope swing suspended from a tree branch
The inhabitants of the house refuse to offer food or shelter and the two teenagers start to get very aggressive kicking at the door and shouting at the people inside
The inhabitants shoot the two teenagers dead one through the chest and the second through the head
Elliot is horrified Elliot Alma and Jess move on till they find an old house with no power which they think is abandoned
A spooky old lady lives there who chooses to remain out of contact with the whole world
She doesn t want to know about the event in the outside world however she gives them supper and a bed for the night We see a newscast discussing the toxin
A scientist is suggesting that judging from the severity and number of the attacks and assuming some similarities to other kinds of natural toxins like ocean algae the attacks will peak at 9am the next day and very quickly fall away to nothing following that In the morning when Elliot wakes up the old lady tells him that he Alma and Jess have to leave
She then goes outside into the garden pauses and starts walking backwards the toxin has affected her
As Elliott cowers inside the house the old lady walks around the porch and headbutts the walls and eventually the window leaving glass splinters in her face and eye and also letting in the wind Elliot runs through the house trying to find Alma and Jess
He can hear them but can t locate them
He thinks he hears them in the cellar but when he goes in he is alone
Alma and Jess are actually outside in an old stone spring house
A speaking tube between the spring house and the cellar has transmitted their voices as clearly as if they were right next to Elliott and Elliott can talk to them through this
He explains that the toxin now seems to be set off by even one person alone Elliot decides that if he is going to die he doesn t want to die alone
They all leave their safe hiding places and walk into the middle of the garden and hold hands
The wind blows
Nothing happens
IT had ended Three months later and they are all living back in Philly
Jess is off to school by bus
Alma is doing a pregnancy test it s positive and Elliot hugs her and looks delighted
On the TV is a scientist warning that the event was like a red tide the first sign that the planet is rejecting humans as pests
The host says that if that were true it would be happening in other places Cut to the gardens at the Jardins du Louvre in Paris France
Two guys are walking discussing plans for after work that evening
Cue distant scream one guy starts to repeat his words about a bike everyone stands still other guy says Oh my God End credits

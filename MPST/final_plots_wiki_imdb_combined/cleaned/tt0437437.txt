Seven years after the events of Prince of Persia The Sands of Time the Prince finds himself constantly hunted by a terrible beast known as the Dahaka
The Prince seeks counsel from an old wise man who explains that whoever releases The Sands of Time must die
Because the Prince escaped his fate it is the Dahaka s mission as guardian of the Timeline to ensure that he dies as he was meant to
The old man also tells of the Island of Time where the Empress of Time first created the Sands
The Prince sets sail for the Island in an attempt to prevent the Sands from ever being created an act he believes will appease the Dahaka
After a battle at sea with an enemy force led by a mysterious woman in black capsizes the Prince s ship the Prince washes ashore unconsciously onto the Island of Time
He later awakens and chases the woman in black through the Empress of Time s fortress into a portal that transports the two into the past
The Prince saves a woman named Kaileena from being killed by the woman in black whose name is Shahdee
Unable to grant the Prince an audience with the Empress of Time who is busy preparing to create the Sands Kaileena instead tells him how to unlock the door to the throne room in which the Empress resides
The Prince makes his way through the fortress using the sand portals to travel back and forth between the past and present and narrowly escapes several encounters with the Dahaka who he discovers cannot pass through water
The Prince activates the mechanisms in the two towers of the fortress the Garden Tower and the Mechanical Tower that serve as locks to the door
He returns to the throne room only to discover that Kaileena is actually the Empress of Time herself who has foreseen in the Timeline that the Prince will kill her and who has decided to attempt to defy her fate just as the Prince is doing
A battle ensues and the Prince proves victorious he kills Kaileena and returns to the present
He believes that he has changed his fate but another encounter with the Dahaka forces him to realize that in killing Kaileena he was in essence the one who created the Sands of Time as the Sands were created from her remains and they flow into the hourglass
The Prince falls into despair but then finds a glimmer of hope upon learning of a magical artifact called the Mask of the Wraith which is said to transport the wearer into the past allowing the wearer to alter his own Timeline
The Prince wastes no time in seeking out and donning the mask which transforms him into the Sand Wraith a monster that constantly ebbs away life and sends him back to the time when he first arrived on the Island of Time
He formulates a plan to force Kaileena through a sand portal with him transporting them both into the present believing that if he kills her then the Sands of Time will be created seven years after the events of Prince of Persia The Sands of Time meaning it will be impossible for the Prince to release them in Azad
While still in the past the Prince ensures that the Dahaka takes and destroys his other self who has just finished unlocking the door to the throne room leaving the Sand Wraith the only Prince in that Timeline
This act loosens the Mask of the Wraith from the Prince s face and allows him to remove it and return to his normal form
The Prince goes to the throne room and despite his pleas to Kaileena his battle with her begins as before
He forces her into the present with him and it is at this point that the game has two alternate endings
Which ending is played depends on whether all life upgrades and Water Sword were collected or not
First ending without the Water Sword The Prince fights and kills Kaileena in the present and the Dahaka arrives to claim her body as well as Farah s amulet from the Prince so that the Sands of Time and all relics pertaining to it are removed from the Timeline
The Prince sails home to Babylon alone only to discover that the city is being ravaged by war
The old wise man s voice is heard once again stating Your journey will not end well
You cannot change your fate
No man can
Second ending with the Water Sword In the present before the battle between The Prince and Kaileena begins the Dahaka appears trying to remove Kaileena from the timeline
The Prince tries to save her and realizes that the Water Sword can damage the seemingly invincible Dahaka
After fighting and defeating the beast the Prince and Kaileena sail to the Prince s home of Babylon with each other
During the journey he apparently ends up making love to Kaileena where a dream enters in the mind of the Prince appearing to be a burning Babylon with a gold crown rolling to the feet of a mysterious shadowy figure that ominously claims All that is yours is rightfully mine and mine it will be
As in the first ending the old wise man s voice is heard stating Your journey will not end well
You cannot change your fate
No man can
This ending is a canonical ending and continues into Prince of Persia The Two Thrones

Bob Henley who comes to a wild and debauched frontier town with his sister Faith

Silk adopts a new approach
He encourages the dance hall girl Dolly to seduce Rev
Henley
She gets him drunk and he spends the night in her room
The following morning the whole town learns of his fall from grace
Blaze rides out to find a doctor for the now near demented minister
The disgraced minister having rapidly descended into alcoholism is goaded into helping the rowdy element to burn down the church
The church goers try to defend the church and a gunfight erupts in which the minister is killed and the church set ablaze
Blaze returns too late to stop the destruction
In revenge Blaze kills Silk and burns down the whole town beginning with the saloon
He and Faith leave to start a new life

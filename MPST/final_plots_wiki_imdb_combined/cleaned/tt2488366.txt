Carmilla arrives in South Carolina to investigate a woman named Millarca
The only information she has is an address but Troy the owner of the house says nobody named Millarca has ever lived there
He offers to give Carmilla a ride into town and she later coincidentally visits a restaurant where Troy s daughter Laura works
Curious Laura presses for more details and Carmilla reveals that Millarca is her mother whom she never knew
Carmilla eventually becomes annoyed with Laura s questions and leaves but Laura stops her to explain that her father once rented out a trailer
Carmilla requests public records at the police station but they tell her it will take two business days
At Laura s urging Troy lets Carmilla stay at the trailer which Troy reveals he once rented to Millarca
Laura invites Carmilla to hang out with her and the two grow closer
Worried about Laura s increasing bond with Carmilla Troy says Millarca was trouble and her daughter likely is too
Laura becomes uncomfortable when Troy tries to kiss her and he breaks down in tears as he says that she reminds him of her dead mother
Later Troy explains that Millarca and Karen Laura s mother were also friends
Troy did not approve of their friendship and as a devout Christian believed Millarca was a bad influence
Troy tells Carmilla that her mother was a thief and left without paying rent
He suggests that she leave soon as he does not want Laura to become too attached to Carmilla if she will be leaving town
Before Carmilla leaves she checks the police station
There she discovers the police were called to Troy s house
In Millarca s statement she says she was having a lesbian affair with Karen
Separately Troy corroborates this with Laura who has demanded the full story
Troy beat both women when he found that they were engaging in blood fetishism
He blamed Karen s mysterious ailment and eventual death on Millarca whom he believes to have been a vampire who seduced Karen
Laura who self injures excitedly tells Carmilla who has not left town yet that she now understands herself and her sexuality
The two begin a lesbian relationship that mirrors that of their mothers
Carmilla discovers Laura s scars and makes Laura promise to stop self injuring
Carmilla further tells Laura she will not engage in blood fetishism any more as it is a substitute for self injury
Carmilla urges Laura to leave town with her but Laura resists
Troy becomes suspicious that Laura is still seeing Carmilla and warns her that he will not allow Carmilla to hurt her
Exasperated Laura insists that Carmilla has done nothing to her
However Troy breaks into her bedroom and discovers extensive scars from Laura s self injuring
Mistaking them as evidence of Carmilla s vampirism Troy threatens to kill Carmilla as he did Millarca
Troy binds Laura to her bed and says that if Carmilla returns to the house it is proof she is a vampire
Laura desperately warns off Carmilla when she does come but Carmilla refuses to leave without her
As Laura tearfully tells Carmilla that Troy killed Millarca Troy a hunter shoots Carmilla with a bow and arrow
Laura stops him before he can finish her off with a knife
As she calls the police Troy retrieves his knife and kills Carmilla
As she dies Carmilla sees her mother
Laura flees the house and drives off into the night as the police arrive

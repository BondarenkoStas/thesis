Henry Pollicut a corrupt Utahn banker and justice of the peace has a man named Gordon and his wife murdered by two bounty killers
To prevent Gordon s son giving them away one of the killers slices the boy s throat rendering him permanently mute
Years later the son armed with a Mauser C96 exacts his revenge by assassinating the bounty killer and shooting Pollicut s right hand thumb
Sometime later in 1898 a severe blizzard has swept the frontier bringing privation to the town of Snow Hill
As a result much of the community is forced to steal in order to survive
Pollicut seeking to make a profit places prices on the thieves heads attracting the attention of a bounty killer gang led by Loco
As they prey on the outlaws Gordon s son now going by the moniker Silence works with the bandits and their allies to fight against the killers
Silence operates on a principle whereby he provokes his enemies into drawing their weapons first so he can kill them in self defense
One of the outlaws a black man named James Middleton leaves the safety of the group to be with his wife Pauline
James is subsequently killed by Loco when he takes Pauline hostage
Vengeful Pauline writes to Silence requesting him to kill Loco
Meanwhile the newly elected Governor hoping to have order maintained before declaring an amnesty regarding the outlaws assigns the righteous but unlucky soldier Gideon Burnett as the sheriff of Snow Hill
On his way Burnett encounters the outlaws who steal his horse for food
After getting lost in the snow he finds a stagecoach travelling to Snow Hill on which he meets Silence and later Loco
Upon arrival Silence meets Pauline who promises to raise his reward
Pauline attempts to sell her house to Pollicut who demands that she becomes his mistress his reason for putting a bounty on her husband
Pauline bitterly refuses
Silence leaves for the town saloon and attempts to provoke Loco into drawing
Instead Loco severely beats him before Silence fights back
Angered Loco attempts to shoot him but he is stopped by Burnett who arrests him for attempted murder and prepares to take him to a prison in Tonopah
Before leaving Burnett requests that the townspeople provide food for the outlaws
Meanwhile Pauline becomes romantically and sexually involved with Silence while tending his wounds
Burnett and Loco stop by a frozen lake to allow Loco to relieve himself but he springs a trap shooting the ice surrounding Burnett and leaving him to die in the freezing water
Loco rides to his hideout and convinces the rest of his gang to confront Silence
Determined to take Pauline by force Pollicut attempts to rape her as his henchman Martin tortures Silence by burning his right hand
Silence overpowers Martin and kills Pollicut
Loco and his gang arrive to look for Silence just as the outlaws appear at the edge of town to collect the provisions having been previously advised to do so by Burnett
Deciding to use them to draw out Silence the gang herds the bandits into the saloon and captures Pauline
Loco tells Pauline to have Silence duel with him if Silence wins the outlaws will be set free if he wins they will be killed
Despite Pauline s pleas that the duel is a trap Silence stands outside the saloon
A killer shoots his left hand greatly impairing his speed and marksmanship
Loco then stands in the doorway ready to face the weakened Silence
As Silence begins reaching for his Mauser Loco reaches for his Colt Single Action Army but as Silence draws another wounding shot is fired
Loco fires at Silence s head killing him
Distraught Pauline attempts to shoot Loco herself but swiftly dies as well
The bounty killers turn their guns on the outlaws massacring the entire group
As Loco and his men prepare to collect their bounties he takes Silence s Mauser from Pauline s hands
The killers ride out of Snow Hill into the morning sun
A title card explains that Loco s actions resulted in public condemnation of bounty killing and a memorial was erected in Snow Hill to honor those who died by his greed
Alternative ending Due to the bleak nature of the original finale Corbucci was forced to shoot an alternative happy ending to the film for the North African market where Spaghetti Westerns were popular but had to have an upbeat conclusion
Some of the footage shot for this ending appeared in the film s Italian trailer despite it not appearing in that release of the film
Because it was believed that no audio elements for this ending had survived early DVD releases of the film such as the US release from Fantoma Films feature it without sound
However a version with synchronised audio has since been discovered and restored
In this ending Loco draws his gun without waiting to be prompted by Silence
Suddenly Burnett having survived falling into the frozen lake rides into town on horseback and shoots Loco in the head allowing Silence to kill the remaining bounty killers
Burnett frees the outlaws as Pauline takes the bandages on Silence s burnt right hand off revealing a gauntlet that he used for protection before applying bandages to his wounded left hand
As Burnett takes the thieves to the local jail to await their amnesty he asks Silence to become his deputy which he accepts with a smile

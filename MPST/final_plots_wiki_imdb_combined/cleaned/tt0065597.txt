The film is set in Elizabethan England and revolves around a wicked magistrate who tries to kill all the members of a coven of witches
It opens like many Vincent Price movies with a quote from Edgar Allan Poe in this case The Bells
Lord Edward Whitman as magistrate presides over the trial of a young woman
Ruling that she is a witch he has her branded whipped through the streets then placed in the village stocks
That night Lord Edward hosts a feast as his henchmen search the countryside for the killers of a sheep
Two poor and ragged looking teenagers are pulled into the hall
A burst of wolf like howling from outside the walls warns that they may be devil marked and in conflict both teens are killed
As his eldest son Sean seduces or rapes his father s wife Lord Whitman begins mumbling that he wants to clean up the witches in the area
Assisted by his two older sons Whitman goes hunting in the hills for witches
His armed posse breaks up what is apparently meant to be a witches Black Sabbath
He kills several of them and tells the rest to scatter to the hills and never return
This makes the leader of the coven Oona extremely angry
To get revenge on the Whitman clan Oona calls up a magical servant a sidhe to destroy the lord s family
Unfortunately the demonic beast takes possession of the friendly decent young servant Roderick that free spirited Maureen Whitman has been in love with for years
The servant turned demon begins to systematically kill off members of the Whitman family
Eventually Harry Whitman s son from Cambridge and Father Tom find Oona and her coven conjuring the death of Maureen and kill Oona
At that moment Roderick who was attacking Maureen breaks off and leaves her
He soon returns and attacks Lord Edward
During this attack Maureen shoots the demon in the head with a blunderbuss apparently killing him
Exhilarated that the curse is over Whitman plans to leave the house with his two remaining children by coach
On the way he stops at the cemetery so he can reassure himself Roderick is dead
To his horror he finds the coffin empty and hurries back to the coach only to find both Harry and Maureen dead
It is then revealed that Bully Boy the coach s driver was murdered by Roderick who is now driving the coach
The film ends with Whitman screeching his driver s name in terror as the coach heads for parts unknown

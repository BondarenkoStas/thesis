The film opens with a typical Monday morning at John F Kennedy High School located in the inner city of Columbus Ohio typical events including a fight between teachers a student with a stab wound and talk of an upcoming lawsuit
We meet haggard Vice Principal Roger Rubell and clueless Principal Eugene Horn as well as stuffy lawyer and JFK alumna Lisa Hammond who is in charge of taking depositions for the Calvin case in which a recent graduate is suing the school for granting him a diploma despite his illiteracy
Alex Jurel is a veteran Social Studies teacher who takes his job lightly despite being one of the most popular teachers in school because of his ability to identify and connect with the students
Jurel has been worn down by years of being in between the rowdy students and the demands of the administration
He is assigned to temporarily take over the duties of the school psychologist and meets a young man named Eddie Pilikian to whom he becomes a mentor
During this time a romance also develops between Jurel and Hammond his former student
The major plotline centers on the Calvin lawsuit with Superintendent Donna Burke and school lawyer Al Lewis attempting to avoid bad publicity associated with the case
To this end they try to figure out which teachers will potentially damage the school s reputation in their depositions
Intertwined with the major storyline are Jurel s efforts to reform Pilikian into a student who believes in himself
A number of minor plotlines deviate from the primary goings on
These include Herbert Gower a wandering mental institution outpatient mistaken for a substitute teacher and put in charge of a U S History class whose brilliant history mind makes it fun educational and engaging gym teacher Mr Troy s sexual relationship with one of Jurel s students Diane Warren that ends with Jurel taking her to an abortion clinic and the death of Eddie Pilikian s best friend Danny Reese a schizophrenic and kleptomaniac student who is shot and killed by the police after he draws a gun from his locker during a drug search
At the climax of the film the administration recognizes the threat Jurel poses to their social standing and forces him to resign before his deposition
After harsh criticism from Lisa as well as her streaking down the school hallway naked he finally stands up to Burke and Rubell reminding them that the school exists for the students and not for the administration and protecting their jobs
He also threatens to sue should he be fired
He proudly walks back into the school with loud cheers from the school s students and Lisa looking on proudly

Tom Cooper is the owner and main teacher of the Academy for the Spiritual Freedom of Women and his real name is Rocco
In there some women learn how to shoot and they practice on pictures of their annoying relatives husbands aunts Cooper lives comfortably and secuces some of the most attractive women who go to the academy One day an old friend of his from his Army times asks him to take care of some business a friend of his has been asked ransom for a son whom everybody had left for dead for years
That son and his batallion disappeared on their way to Gran Alamo and the friend of the father thinks that the batallion must have lost his way to Snake Valley a small sun burnt town in the village of nowhere where you arrive leaving the main road to the left
At the beginning Cooper is not interested but that night his old friend is shot to dead by Alan Pinkerton outside the Pinkerton detective agency
He was close enough to hear his last words think of the father So Tom Cooper makes believe he s a meek doctor with a fake degree certificate
He doesn t defend himself when two rascals Black and Pink demand a 25cent toll of him for going to Snake Valley
They hit him but the Colonel appears to defend him
Cooper is given his money back and arrives to his destination everybody on the street seems to stare at him He checks in in the saloon of the town
Mrs Bess allows him to check in
Cooper allows himself to be beaten again however later on he wins everybody on a fight because of the scientific art of fighting
That night he tries to watch around what s going on
He enters a room and Josefa the saloon waitress a young girl who is Mrs Bess niece watches him
He pretends to be trying to make out with her
Bess overhears the noise and comes up to see what s happening
From that moment on Josefa seems to dislike the doctor deeply
In the conversation with Mrs Bess Cooper hints at his interest on Mrs Bess herself to which she seems incredulous The next morning Clayton White and other people call on the doctor
However the sheriff Bingo accompanies the doctor saying that he won t have any customers anyway
The gravedigger tells him that Clayton has just died and White tells the doctor that he s OK that he had been summoned because of his wife but that she s already well Coming back to the saloon Mrs Bess tells the doctor that he won t make any money on Snake Valley
The doctor recommends Josefa to take a pill against the smoke but she doesn t really swallow it she just spits it
Immediately afterwards Cooper puts something on the saloon fire so that all the room gets smoky and foggy
Josefa gets dizzy like everybody else because she spit the pill
Mrs Bess who seems unaffected by the smoke punches Josefa and carries her upstairs
All the rest of the patrons look drugged out of their minds A military cornet resounds
One of the saloon patrons gets into a frantic and says that he didn t want to do it and the major kills him
The kidnapped batallion gets all excited imprisoned underground thinking that finally the army is coming to rescue them
The colonel of the town asks for Peter Headway telling him that his father hasn t got any money to pay the ransom because of his gambling habit and Peter is asked whether he has got any other relative who could pay 50 000 dollars
Peter knows that nobody he knows has such an incredible amount of money so he is shot to death Cooper shoots two gunners who tried to shoot him in the night
He gets threatened once again
However at that moment in the middle of the saloon he takes off his glasses his coat and his bow hat and instead of leaving he tells to everybody that gunman Sugar Colt has arrived and to prove his worth he shoots several of the gunmen present at the saloon
Agon√≠a one of the gunmen present is made to wake up and confess having told Cooper aka Sugar Colt that something was happening in the town
He denies it but he is hanged anyway The colonel knows that Sugar Colt must have been helped by the person who played the trumpet
The next day the burial of the person who really tried to help Cooper is organized but many townspeople did not want to meddle with that business
The major tries to buy Sugar Colt but he doesn t look eager to compromise although he also avoids creating a scene on the burial place
The major asks him whether he believes that the trumpet is played by the ghost
Of course Cooper doesn t say it s really Sammy his assisstant who is looking for an abandoned mine or a derelict building or a place where a group of people may be hidden from view
Sugar Colt finds Sammy s corpse he had heard the two long wailing notes which were their keyword but could not assist him at that particular moment as he was talking with the colonel
Josefa had insulted him because he was leaving but now Sugar Colt has a personal reason to keep on the case again Cooper is trapped and left alive but carried tied on a horse
He unties himself down and kills some of the bad guys and runs away
He is hurt but alive and returns to the salloon on the verge of collapse
Josefa and Bess tend to him and his wounds The colonel hits Bess and he tells her that it was him who gave her the saloon
However the colonel takes Josefa with him to force Bess not to help Sugar Colt anymore who had run away from the saloon Sugar Colt kills one of the sentinels by pushing him down a well after stealing his Mexican sombrero
He disguises himself with that and takes one basket of bread with some other bread porters to the prisoners
There he frees them
He leaves them but tells them to wait inside
However the privates will not wait and their leader Preston goes with them
They try to leave but some are killed with a shotgun
Sugar Colt uses some explosives to help them Josefa also gets rid of the sentinel who is keeping her a prisoner
The colonel tries to run away after taking some money from the safe
He tries to have his own back by shooting Josefa who runs away throughout the window
Preston helps him from the other side of the street shooting at the colonel Finally the colonel has nowhere else to die
He runs into the saloon where Bess will shoot him Later that day Josefa is giving alcohol to the ex prisoners outside on the street
Cooper Sugar Colt asks her for some but she seems to reject him Soon Cooper Sugar Colt leaves the place with a dirty cart
Suddenly he hears a cough
He pulls of a blanket and there it lies Josefa hidden away
Cooper smiles and pulls the blanket over her and keeps on marching on on his horse

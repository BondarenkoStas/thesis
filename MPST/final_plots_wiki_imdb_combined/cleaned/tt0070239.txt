The camera pans across a landscape of desert hills dotted with stone ruins
A plume of dust in the distance resolves into a red and white bus that stops and disgorges a troupe of actors
The actors unpack costumes and props including a large wooden cross
They dance around Ted Neeley who will play Jesus and dress him in a white robe
The actors some still dancing deploy themselves around the ruins of what might have been a temple As Jesus talks with a group of followers Judas watches from a distance and worries
He s afraid that Jesus is beginning to believe what people are saying about him that he s God
He s also afraid that Jesus followers will turn on him when they find that he isn t God and that the Romans who occupy Judea will come down on them if they perceive Jesus growing following as a threat to their rule In the cave where Jesus and his followers are staying the apostles ask when they re going to Jerusalem
Jesus puts them off
Mary Magdalene seeing that Jesus is hot and tired tries to soothe him by bathing his face with cool water which Jesus appreciates
Judas steps in to say he thinks it strange that a man like you Can waste his time On women of her kind
Jesus responds angrily Caiaphas the high priest discusses Jesus with his associate Annas
Like Judas Caiaphas believes that Jesus popularity will bring down the wrath of the Romans
He mentions talk of crowning Jesus king
They agree to take the matter to the priests council Back at the cave Mary sings to Jesus to relax him and rubs ointment on his head and feet
Judas interrupts to scold Mary for wasting money on expensive ointment when it could have been used to help the poor
Jesus points out that they can t help everyone He adds that he ll soon be gone a warning that no one but Judas seems to notice In council Caiaphas tells the other priests that Jesus is a danger to the nation concluding Like John the Baptist before him This Jesus must die Jesus is carried into Jerusalem by cheering palm waving crowds
Caiaphas advises Jesus to disperse the mob because they re too loud
Nothing can be done to stop the shouting Jesus replies joyfully If every tongue was stilled the noise would still continue The rocks and stones themselves would start to sing
Later in a big dance number followers led by Simon Zealotes tell Jesus how much they love him at first he smiles at the crowd and laps it up
Simon urges Jesus to Keep them yelling their devotion But add a touch of hate at Rome You ll get the power and the glory Forever and ever and ever
Jesus loses his smile while Judas looks on anxiously this is the sort of thing Judas most fears
Some Roman soldiers march up and stop to watch but Simon and his crowd are too wrapped up in their hero worship to notice
In a somber mood Jesus tells the people and Mary who kneels at his feet that none of them understand power and glory and To conquer death You only have to die
Simon is deeply puzzled Pontius Pilate a Roman official sings of a dream in which he met a Galilean a most amazing man
He had that look you very rarely find The haunting hunted kind
Pilate foresees that he ll be blamed for the death of the Galilean in his dream Jesus visits the temple which is like a modern day flea market with modern day merchandise plus money lenders of course
And prostitutes
Becoming angry Jesus runs around dumping tables and knocking over stalls
Judas again watches in dismay
The vendors and customers flee
Jesus walks off into the hills perhaps to calm down but is accosted among the rocks by a crowd of the blind halt and sick who beg to be healed
At first he reaches out to them but he s unable to help them all and the mob seems to swallow him
He finally screams leave me alone
Meeting Jesus as he walks back to their camp Mary wraps him in a tattered blanket and sings to him as he lies down under a tent
As he sleeps she muses about her love for Jesus which confuses and frightens her
I m the one Who s always been So calm so cool No lover s fool
I never thought I d come to this
Judas seems to be agonizing over something he squats in an empty landscape letting sand run through his fingers
When a row of Roman tanks appears over the crest of the hill and bears down on him he runs to the temple
He s there to betray Jesus but tries first to explain his motives to the uninterested priests
All they want to know is where the soldiers can find Jesus at a time when he s not surrounded by crowds
Caiaphas offers Judas a fee which Judas turns down until Caiaphas points out that Judas can give the money to the poor he knows exactly which buttons to press
Judas takes the bag of money and says that Jesus will be in the Garden of Gethsemane on Thursday night In the Garden of Gethsemane the apostles are feeling mellow and Jesus is feeling sorry for himself not without reason given what he seems to know is about to happen to him
For all you care this wine could be my blood he says
He goes on to predict that one of you here dining will soon betray Jesus and another will deny knowing him
Judas exchanges some bitter words with Jesus before going off to bring the soldiers
The remaining apostles fall asleep and Jesus asks will no one wait with me
Peter
John
James
Jesus goes for a walk to commune with God
He asks whether he has to go through with his death and asks to know the reason for it
If God replies it s not evident Judas comes back with soldiers and identifies Jesus for them with his famous betraying kiss
Peter and the other apostles wake up and offer to defend Jesus but Jesus tells them it s all over and to stick to fishing from now on
The soldiers march Jesus back to the city attracting a crowd as they go
Curious bystanders and journalists question him as he walks
Jesus doesn t answer
The soldiers take Jesus to Caiaphas who asks if he s really the son of God
Jesus doesn t deny it only replying that s what you say
The crowd demands take him to Pilate
Peter Mary and another disciple stop at a camp along the road for water
A woman a soldier and an old man all recognize Peter but each time Peter claims not to know Jesus
Mary says sadly It s what he told us you would do
I wonder how he knew
Jesus is frog marched into the presence of Pilate who makes fun of him asks him if he s really king of the Jews and dismisses his case to Herod
King Herod surrounded by wildly costumed dancing courtiers twits Christ in his turn
In King Herod s Song he offers to let Jesus go if he ll perform a miracle
When Jesus fails to respond Herod declares him a fraud and sends him away Mary Magdalen and Peter standing on a stark mountainside overlooking the desert wish for things to go back to the way they were before Jesus was arrested
They re backed by a crowd of followers
Jesus turns and walks off into the desert Jesus is taken back to Pilate where the priests ask that Jesus be sentenced to death
Pilate resists saying Christ has committed no crime worthy of death and asking Jesus to defend himself
The crowd gets so agitated that Pilate agrees to flog Jesus
But it s not enough
Faced with an incipient riot and Jesus insistence that nothing Pilate can do will prevent his death a frustrated Pilate says die if you want to you misguided martyr
and washes his hands Soldiers throw Jesus into a pit where Judas peers down at him until he s pushed away by a guard
Judas goes back to the priests to complain about how badly Christ has been treated saying he d save him the suffering if he could
Annas and Caiaphas tell Judas that events have unfolded just as he predicted and What you have done Will be the saving of Israel
Judas isn t comforted and continues in a song that includes a brief reprise of I Don t Know how to Love Him to berate himself for the betrayal
Overcome with remorse Judas hangs himself from a tree In another fantasy sequence Judas descends from a star to speak to Jesus who is alone in the amphitheater where the trial was held
Judas points out that Jesus could have spread his message more easily if he d come today
He asks Jesus why he chose such a backward time And such a strange land
On a hilltop where two men have already been crucified soldiers are pounding nails into something on the ground
They raise a cross on which Jesus is hanging crowned with thorns
They jeer but Jesus asks God to forgive them
A few of Jesus followers including a grief stricken Mary watch from below
The soldiers raise a ladder and nail a board to the cross above Jesus head
It s just possible to make out the letters INRI on the board they stand for Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum Jesus of Nazareth king of the Jews
Jesus asks my God my God why have you forgotten me
and says Father into your hands I commend my spirit
He dies As the film ends the performers out of costume reboard their bus
Last come Yvonne Elliman and Carl Anderson there s no sign of Jesus
Ted Neeley stripped away his costume and disappeared into the cast beforehand
The bus drives off
The final shot shows the empty cross against a setting sun as a shepherd and his flock cross the hillside

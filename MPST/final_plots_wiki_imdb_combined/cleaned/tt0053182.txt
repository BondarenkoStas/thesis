Time The recent past
Act 1 Scene 1 Catfish Row a summer evening The opera begins with a short introduction which segues into an evening in Catfish Row
Jasbo Brown entertains the community with his piano playing
Clara a young mother sings a lullaby to her baby as the working men prepare for a game of craps
One of the players Robbins scorns his wife Serena s demands that he not play retorting that on a Saturday night a man has the right to play
Clara s husband the fisherman Jake tries his own lullaby with little effect
Little by little other characters in the opera enter Catfish Row among them Mingo another fisherman and Jim a stevedore who tired of his job decides to give it up and join Jake and the other fishermen
Porgy a disabled beggar enters on his goat cart to organize the game
Peter an elderly honey man returns singing his vendor s call
Crown a strong and brutal stevedore storms in with his woman Bess and buys cheap whiskey and some Happy Dust off the local dope peddler Sportin Life
Bess is shunned by the women of the community especially the pious Serena and the matriarchal cookshop owner Maria but Porgy softly defends her
The game begins
One by one the players get crapped out leaving only Robbins and Crown who has become extremely drunk
When Robbins wins Crown attempts to prevent him from taking his winnings
A brawl ensues which ends when Crown stabs Robbins with a cotton hook killing him
Crown runs telling Bess to fend for herself but that he will be back for her when the heat dies down
Sportin Life gives her a dose of happy dust and offers to take her with him when he goes to New York but she rejects him
He flees and Bess begins to pound on doors but is rejected by all of the residents of Catfish Row with the exception of Porgy who lets her in
Scene 2 Serena s Room the following night The mourners sing a spiritual to Robbins
To raise money for his burial a saucer is placed on his chest for the mourners donations
Bess enters with Porgy and attempts to donate to the burial fund but Serena rejects her money until Bess explains that she is now living with Porgy
A white detective enters and coldly tells Serena that she must bury her husband the next day or his body will be given to medical students
He suddenly accuses Peter of Robbins s murder
Peter denies his guilt and says Crown was the murderer
The Detective orders Peter to be arrested as a material witness whom he will force to testify against Crown
Serena laments her loss in My Man s Gone Now
The undertaker enters
The saucer holds only fifteen dollars of the needed twenty five but he agrees to bury Robbins as long as Serena promises to pay him back
Bess who has been sitting in silence slightly apart from the rest of those gathered suddenly begins to sing a gospel song and the chorus joyfully join in welcoming her into the community
Act 2 Scene 1 Catfish Row a month later in the morning Jake and the other fishermen prepare for work
Clara asks Jake not to go because it is time for the annual storms but he tells her that they desperately need the money
This causes Porgy to sing from his window about his new happy go lucky outlook on life

Sportin Life waltzes around selling happy dust but soon incurs the wrath of Maria who threatens him

A fraudulent lawyer Frazier arrives and farcically divorces Bess from Crown
When he discovers Bess and Crown were not married he raises his price from a dollar to a dollar and a half
Archdale a white lawyer enters and informs Porgy that Peter will soon be released
The bad omen of a buzzard flies over Catfish Row and Porgy demands that it leave now that he finally has found happiness
As the rest of Catfish Row prepares for the church picnic on nearby Kittiwah Island Sportin Life again offers to take Bess to New York with him she refuses
He attempts to give her some happy dust despite her claims that she s given up drugs but Porgy grabs his arm and scares him off
Sportin Life leaves reminding Bess as he goes that her men friends come and go but he will be there all along
Bess and Porgy are now left alone and express their love for each other
The chorus re enters in high spirits as they prepare to leave for the picnic

Everyone gets ready to leave
As Bess who has lagged behind tries to follow them Crown emerges from the bushes
He reminds her that Porgy is temporary and laughs off her claims that she has been living decently now
Bess wants to leave Crown forever and attempts to make him forget about her but Crown refuses to give her up
He grabs her and will not let her go to the boat which leaves without her and then forcefully kisses her
He laughs at his conquest as her resistance begins to fail and commands her to get into the woods where his intentions are only too clear
Scene 3 Catfish Row a week later just before dawn A week later Jake leaves to go fishing with his crew one of whom observes that it looks as if a storm is coming in
Peter still unsure of his crime returns from prison
Meanwhile Bess is lying in Porgy s room delirious with fever which she has had ever since returning from Kittiwah Island
Serena prays to remove Bess s affliction and promises Porgy that Bess will be well by five o clock
As the day passes a strawberry woman Peter and a crab man each pass by with their wares
As the clock chimes five Bess recovers from her fever
Porgy tells Bess that he knows she has been with Crown and she admits that Crown has promised to return for her
Porgy tells her she is free to go if she wants to and she tells him that although she wants to stay she is afraid of Crown s hold on her
Porgy asks her what would happen if there was no Crown and Bess tells Porgy she loves him and begs him to protect her and he promises that she will never have to be afraid again
Clara watches the water fearful for Jake
Maria tries to allay her fears but suddenly the hurricane bell begins to ring
Scene 4 Serena s Room dawn of the next day The residents of Catfish Row are all gathered in Serena s room for shelter from the hurricane
They drown out the sound of the storm with prayers and hymns while Sportin Life mocks their assumption that the storm is a signal of Judgment Day
Clara desperately sings her lullaby
A knock is heard at the door and the chorus believes it to be Death
Crown enters dramatically having swum from Kittiwah Island seeking Bess
He shows no fear of God claiming that after the long struggle from Kittiwah God and he are friends
The chorus tries to drown out his blaspheming with more prayer and he taunts them by singing a vulgar song

Suddenly Clara sees Jake s boat float past the window upside down and she runs out to try to save him handing her baby to Bess
Bess asks that one of the men go out with her and Crown taunts Porgy who cannot go
Crown goes himself yelling out as he leaves Alright Big Friend
We re on for another Bout
The chorus continue to pray as the storm rises
Act 3 Scene 1 Catfish Row the next night A group of women mourn Clara Jake and all of those who have been killed in the storm
When they begin to mourn for Crown as well Sportin Life laughs at them and is told off by Maria
He insinuates that Crown may not be dead and observes that when a woman has a man maybe she s got him for keeps but if she has two men then it s highly likely she ll end up with none
Bess is heard singing Clara s lullaby to her baby whom she is now taking care of

Once Catfish Row is dark Crown stealthily enters to claim Bess but is confronted by Porgy
A fight ensues which ends when Porgy kills Crown
Porgy exclaims to Bess You ve got a man now
You ve got Porgy
Scene 2 Catfish Row the next afternoon The detective enters and talks with Serena and her friends about the murders of Crown and Robbins
They deny knowledge of Crown s murder frustrating the detective
Needing a witness for the coroner s inquest he next questions an apprehensive Porgy
Once Porgy admits to knowing Crown he is ordered to come and identify Crown s body
Sportin Life tells Porgy that corpses bleed in the presence of their murderers and the detective will use this to hang Porgy
Porgy refuses to identify the body but is dragged off anyway
Bess is distraught and Sportin Life puts his plan into action
He tells her that Porgy will be locked up for a long time and points out that he is the only one still here
He offers her happy dust and though she refuses he forces it on her
After she takes a whiff he paints a seductive picture of her life with him in New York
She regains her strength and rushes inside slamming the door on his face but he leaves a packet of happy dust on her doorstep and settles down to wait
Scene 3 Catfish Row a week later On a beautiful morning Porgy is released from jail where he has been arrested for contempt of court after refusing to look at Crown s body
He returns to Catfish Row much richer after playing craps with his cellmates
He gives gifts to the residents and pulls out a beautiful red dress for Bess
He does not understand why everyone seems so uneasy at his return
He sees Clara s baby is now with Serena and realizes something is wrong
He asks where Bess is
Maria and Serena tell him that Bess has run off with Sportin Life to New York
Porgy calls for his goat cart and resolves to leave Catfish Row to find her
He prays for strength and begins his journey

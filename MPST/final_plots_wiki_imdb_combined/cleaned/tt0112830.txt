Eleven girls have disappeared from an Eau Claire Wisconsin Catholic school in the last five years
When one of them an orphaned outsider named Gwendolyn is found dead hanged at the church bells Seattleite deputy sheriff Jack Gates is assigned to the task to the mystery
When he arrives he is upset to find out that the unexperienced Doc has already claimed to have examined the body and that the body has already been removed
Mother Superior assigns her secretary and the school s history teacher nun Cristina Herrera to help Jack with the case
Jack is especially interested in a stolen cross that was also reported along with the death
Through one of the students Beth a popular student who bullies Polly Jack learns that the school keeps the spirit of Mother Bernadette the former mother superior alive
Mother Bernadette has her own locked from the outside sanctuary and the students are taught that she is always with them
That night Beth sneaks out to have sex with delivery boy Eric
Meanwhile student Suzy Carroll is being chased and murdered by an unknown person
The following morning Jack learns from Doc that Gwen did not commit suicide but was murdered there was a cross sign carved in her stomach after her death
Doc thinks that Gwen was being punished for being four months pregnant at the time of her death
Jack is next informed that Suzy has disappeared and that this has happened before at the school
He gets mad at Mother Superior for not having informed him earlier but she explains that she did not bother because all the girls were of age and were probably eloping
Meanwhile in class Beth accuses her teacher Gray of having impregnated Gwen Headmaster Gray responds by revealing that he knows about her affair with Eric
The following night Marie is chased by an unknown person near the graveyard
She is saved by Jack and claims that a woman has touched her
She tries to kiss him but Jack holds his distance as does he with Rita a waitress of a nearby bar whom he befriended
The next day Cristina shares her doubt in the integrity of some of the staff with Jack she finds it strange that Father Anthony graduated top of his class at Harvard and is now teaching at the small Catholic school Mother Superior supposedly killed her husband in the past and Emily the school s cook gave birth to a stillborn child
She is unable to find out however why Headmaster Gray left his previous school eight years earlier
Jack has recently found out that Headmaster Gray previously known as Marc Anthony was arrested in Webster Illinois for having sex with one of his students the charges were later dropped
The girls meanwhile fear that they might be the next to disappear
Nevertheless Beth sneaks out to meet with Eric but he is stabbed to death by a person dressed in white
Beth is chased as well but escapes she later claims to have witnessed the presence of Mother Bernadette
Jack then confronts Gray with his record and then finds sex tapes of the missing girls and Beth among Gray s stuff
He concludes that Gray is the killer but Gray kills himself before an arrest can be made
Jack celebrates having solved the case with Cristina who reveals herself not as a nun but as a private investigator hired by the church
They end up having sex that night
When Marie is reported missing Jack and Cristina realize that Gray was not the killer
Cristina concludes that all the girls murdered were good girls and that the murderer must have learned of their innocence through the confessional
Cristina finds a secret tunnel behind the confessional and is knocked unconscious by the murderer
Jack tries to rescue her but is stabbed in the stomach by the murderer who has revealed herself as Emily
Cristina eventually rescues Jack by stabbing Emily to death with a cross
They escape the tunnel and later conclude that Gwen killed herself all along because she was the only girl who had a sin and thus could not have been a victim of Emily

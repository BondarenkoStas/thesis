The rebel realizes he has the opportunity to rid the South of two of its greatest enemies and tries to shoot them leaving Zeb no choice but to kill him with the bayonet from his shattered musket
Afterward Zeb rejoins the army
Harry Morgan was uncredited in some of the marketing for How the West Was Won an ironic fact given that his portrayal of Grant is regarded by some observers as the best ever filmic portrayal of the general
Morgan would go on to have one of the more successful TV careers of any actor of his generation climaxing with his work as another gritty military man Col Potter on MASH in the 70s

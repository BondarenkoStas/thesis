Setting Final Fantasy VI takes place on a large unnamed world
During the course of the game its geography and landscape change due to various developments in the game s plot
During the first half of the game the world is divided into three major continents and referred to as the World of Balance
The northern continent is punctuated by a series of mountain ranges and contains many of the locations accessible to the player
Most of the southern continent has been taken over by the Empire while the eastern continent is home to a large patch of land called the Veldt where monsters from all over the world can be found
Halfway through the game the world s geographical layout is altered resulting in its three large continents splitting into several islands of various size situated around a larger continent at their center
This altered layout of the game s locations is referred to as the World of Ruin
In contrast to the medieval settings featured in previous Final Fantasy titles Final Fantasy VI is set in what is now known as a steampunk environment
The structure of society parallels that of the latter half of the 19th century with opera and the fine arts serving as recurring motifs throughout the game and a level of technology comparable to that of the Second Industrial Revolution
Railroads and steamships are in use and a coal mining operation is run in the northern town of Narshe
Additionally several examples of modern engineering and weaponry have been developed in the Kingdom of Figaro
However communication systems have not reached significant levels of development with letters sent by way of carrier pigeon serving as the most common means of long distance communication
A thousand years before the events of the game three entities known as the Warring Triad initiated a conflict that would come to be called the War of the Magi
This quarrel grew to catastrophic proportions unleashing magical energy into the world which transformed afflicted humans into espers magical beings who themselves were used as soldiers in the war
Eventually realizing the horrific calamity wrought by their hands the Triad returned free will to the espers and sealed their own powers becoming stone statues
Their only request was that the espers ensure their power remain locked away so it might never be used again
The espers carried their stone gods to a hidden land sealing both the statues and themselves off from the realm of humans
The concept of magic gradually faded to legend and myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology
At the game s opening the most advanced nation is the Empire a cruel and expanding dictatorship led by Emperor Gestahl and his clownish general Kefka Palazzo
Approximately eighteen years before the events of the game begin the barrier between the espers land and the rest of the world weakened
Soon after Gestahl takes advantage of this and attacks the espers land capturing several of them
Using the espers as a power source Gestahl initiated a research program to combine magic with machinery and infuse humans with magical powers the result being a craft known as Magitek
Kefka became the first experimental prototype of a line of magically empowered soldiers called Magitek Knights drastically impairing his sanity
Magitek innovations have allowed the Empire to supplement its forces with mechanical infantry armed with Magitek powered weaponry
At the opening of the game the Empire is on the verge of rediscovering the full potential of magic by reopening the gateway to the world of the espers
However Gestahl s military dominion is opposed by the Returners a rebel organization seeking to overthrow the Empire and free its territories
Characters Final Fantasy VI features fourteen permanent playable characters the most of any game in the main series as well as several secondary characters who are only briefly controlled by the player
The starting character Terra Branford is a reserved half human half esper girl who spent most of her life as a slave to the Empire thanks to a mind controlling device and is unfamiliar with love
Other primary characters include Locke Cole a treasure hunter and rebel sympathizer with a powerful impulse to protect women Celes Chere a former general of the Empire who joined the Returners after being jailed for questioning imperial practices Edgar Figaro a consummate womanizer and the king of Figaro who claims allegiance to the Empire while secretly supplying aid to the Returners Sabin Rene Figaro Edgar s brother who fled the royal court in order to pursue his own path and hone his martial arts skills Cyan Garamonde a loyal knight to the kingdom of Doma who lost his family and friends as a result of Kefka poisoning the kingdom s water supply Setzer Gabbiani a habitual gambler and thrill seeker and owner of the world s only airship Shadow a ninja mercenary who offers his services to both the Empire and the Returners at various stages throughout the game Relm Arrowny a young but tough artistic girl with magical powers Strago Magus Relm s elderly grandfather and a Blue Mage Gau a feral child surviving since infancy in the harsh wilderness known as the Veldt Mog a Moogle from the mines of Narshe Umaro a savage but loyal sasquatch also from Narshe talked into joining the Returners through Mog s persuasion and Gogo a mysterious fully shrouded master of the art of mimicry
Most of the main characters in the game hold a significant grudge against the Empire and in particular Kefka Palazzo who serves as one of the game s main antagonists along with Emperor Gestahl
The supporting character Ultros serves as a recurring villain and comic relief throughout the game
A handful of Final Fantasy VI characters have reappeared in later games such as Secret of Evermore
Additionally Final Fantasy SGI a short tech demo produced for the Silicon Graphics Onyx workstation featured polygon based 3D renderings of Locke Terra and Shadow
Story A mind controlled Terra Branford participates in an Imperial raid on Narshe in search of a recently unearthed frozen esper found in the city s mines
The esper then kills Terra s controllers and breaks the Imperial control over her but she is unable to remember anything about her past
Locke Cole a treasure hunter promises to protect her until she can regain her memories and helps her escape to the hideout of the Returners a group of militants opposing the Empire
Along the way they pass through the Kingdom of Figaro and meet Edgar Roni Figaro the king and his estranged brother Sabin Rene Figaro who join them
Banon the leader of the Returners asks for Terra s help in their struggle against the Empire and she agrees
Just as the resistance is preparing to return to Narshe to investigate the frozen esper the Empire attacks South Figaro
Locke heads to the besieged town to slow the Empire s advance while the rest of the group makes their way via rafting down the nearby Lethe River
However Sabin is separated from the group after a battle with Ultros self proclaimed octopus royalty and a recurring antagonist forcing the various members of the Returners to find their own ways to Narshe in three different scenarios controlled by the player
In Locke s scenario he must escape the imperial occupied town of South Figaro without detection
Sabin has been swept to a distant continent and must find a way back while Terra Edgar and Banon will continue to float down the Lethe River back to Narshe
Eventually the original party reunites in Narshe
Locke brings with him Celes Chere one of the Empire s own generals whom he saved from execution for defying the Empire s ruthless practices
Sabin brings with him Cyan Garamonde whose family was killed during the Empire s siege of Doma Castle when Kefka Palazzo ordered the water supply poisoned and Gau a feral child he befriended on the Veldt
In Narshe the Returners prepare to defend the frozen esper from the Empire
After the player successfully thwarts the Imperial invasion Terra approaches the frozen esper prompting her to transform into an esper like form herself
She flies away confused and horrified by her own transformation
The Returners set out to search for Terra and eventually trace her to the city of Zozo though they are still shocked by her apparent existence as an esper
There they also meet the esper Ramuh who tells them that if they free various other espers from the Magitek Research Facility in the Empire s capital Vector they may find one who can help Terra
Vector is on the southern continent to which the Empire does not allow maritime access so the Returners go to the Opera House and recruit Setzer Gabbiani who is believed to be the owner of the Blackjack the only airship in the world
They then travel to Vector and attempt to rescue several espers including Maduin who is revealed to be Terra s father
However the espers are already dying from the experiments at Vector and choose instead to give their lives to transform into magicite the crystallized remains of the espers essences that form when they die and allow others to use their powers
The dying espers bestow their magicite upon the Returners
Before the group can then escape Kefka arrives and causes the Returners including Locke to momentarily doubt Celes loyalty much to her anguish
However she provides proof to them of her support by covering for the group while the rest escape
The rest of the group then returns to Zozo where Terra reacts to the magicite of her father prompting her to gain knowledge of her past and accept herself as the half human half esper child of Maduin and a human woman
After reuniting with Terra the Returners decide that it is time to launch an all out attack on the Empire and Banon asks Terra to attempt contacting the espers land in order to gain their support
Terra succeeds in making contact and when the espers learn that the others captured by the Empire previously have now perished they become infuriated and enter the human world where they destroy much of Vector
When the Returners arrive in the capital they find Emperor Gestahl claiming to no longer have the will to fight inviting the Returners to a banquet to negotiate peace
Gestahl asks Terra to deliver a truce to the espers on his behalf to which she agrees
Accompanied by Locke Shadow Generals Celes and Leo the player must then guide Terra to the remote village Thamasa in search of the espers where they meet Strago Magus and his granddaughter Relm Arrowny who also accompany them
Soon they find the espers and Terra convinces them to accept a truce with Gestahl
However during the negotiations Kefka attacks the espers killing each of those still alive and capturing the magicite that remains from their essence
Additionally he kills General Leo who is appalled by Kefka s dishonorable tactics and attempts to defend the espers
The Returners reunite now aware that the peace was a ploy for Gestahl to obtain magicite and the stone statue remains of the Warring Triad within the espers now unsealed land
Kefka and Gestahl travel through the open gate to the esper world find the Warring Triad and prompt the island on which the esper world is located to detach and fly in the sky as an ominous Floating Continent
The Returners attempt to stop them from causing further damage but despite their efforts they are unable to prevent Kefka and Gestahl from gaining the power of the statues
Now empowered Kefka promptly kills Gestahl and moves the statues out of their proper alignment upsetting the balance of magical power and causing the destruction of most of the surface world
In the disaster the Returners are separated from one another as Setzer s airship is torn apart
One year later Celes awakens from a coma on a deserted island and learns that the world has been devastated by Kefka who now dominates it as a god like ruler
Much of the human population has died and plant and animal life are slowly being killed by sickness punctuating humanity s despair
Celes sets out from the Solitary Island to try to reunite with as many of her friends as she can find
Celes is only required by the game s story to reunite with Edgar and Setzer who leads them to the Falcon an airship that belonged to a deceased friend however in a series of mostly optional side quests the player has the opportunity to gather the entire group all still alive as well as new allies Umaro and Gogo
Together this quantity of Returners launch a new offensive against Kefka s Tower
Inside the Returners battle their way through Kefka s defenses and destroy the three statues the source of Kefka s newfound power
When destroying the statues once the source of all magic does not cause any noticeable reaction the party realizes that Kefka has successfully drained the Warring Triad of power and has become the source of all magical power
Making a final stand against Kefka the characters destroy him but since the gods power had come to reside in him all magicite begins to shatter and Kefka s magically maintained tower begins to crumble
The Returners make their escape though if Terra is present she begins to weaken due to her half esper heritage
However before her father s magicite shatters his spirit informs her that by holding to the human side of herself she may survive the passing of magic
In the end the party escapes Kefka s Tower aboard the Falcon
Terra survives and the group observes the world s communities rejuvenating themselves

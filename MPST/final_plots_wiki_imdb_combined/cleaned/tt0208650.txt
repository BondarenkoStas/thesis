The story is centered around Alan s son Jethro Bradley
Since the film s events ENCOM has been taken over by a company called fCON
After talking with his father who is kidnapped while on the phone with Jet Jet is digitized by Ma3a Alan s AI computer system to aid her against J D
Thorne an executive from fCON improperly digitized into the computer who is now a virus throughout the system
Jet is mistakenly identified as the source of the corruption and captured by Kernel the systems security control program
After deciding that Jet is corrupted Kernel spares Jet on the recommendation of Mercury another program tasked to help Ma3a and Jet is sent to the lightcycles game program
After winning several matches Jet escapes the match with Mercury s help
After they find Ma3a the server corrupted beyond saving is reformatted resulting in Mercury s demise
Jet escapes to the Internet with Ma3a and an uncompiled copy of Tron Legacy an update of the original Tron program written by Alan Bradley to protect Ma3a
After finding a compiling program on the Internet Thorne appears to kill Ma3a while the Tron code is compiled and attached to her program
During this Jet receives a communication from Guest the User who had assigned Mercury to help Jet
Accessing a video uplink Jet realizes too late that Guest is his father Alan locked in a storage closet by fCON s officers Baza Popoff and Crowne begging him not to compile the Legacy program
Legacy activates revealing that its sole function is to kill any User in the digital world
Jet escapes and fCON inadvertently saves him by capturing Ma3a in a search program
Having recovered the correction algorithms necessary to digitize a human Alan is sent to Thorne s corrupted server
Assisting the ICPs and Kernel Jet reaches Thorne at the heart of the server and kills Kernel before he can destroy Thorne
Thorne regaining a moment of lucidity begs for forgiveness and tells Jet how to enter fCON s server
Alan and Jet break into fCON s server which the corporation is planning to use to distribute Datawraiths digitized human hackers across the worldwide information network
After Alan and Jet crash the server the CEO of fCON orders Baza Popoff and Crowne into the system themselves
Alan wanting to verify the purity of the correction algorithms removes them to inspect them as the three are digitized resulting in a monstrous amalgam of the three which chases Jet into the digitizing beam whereupon Jet diverts the three out of the beam and escapes the computer

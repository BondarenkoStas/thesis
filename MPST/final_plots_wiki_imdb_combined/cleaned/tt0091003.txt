There s a time travelling 1 eyed mad scientist that created a cyborg with a laser on his arm
Said cyborg attempts escape certain dismantlement which ends up killing some Asian assistant scientist that tried to help him
After escaping using tank treads as legs and shooting lasers at hired goons he goes to another scientist for help played by Lt Yar from Star Trek
Yar has a little flying robot that seems to be a mix of that owl from Clash of the Titans and R2 D2
Yar Owl2 D2 and Mandroid then hire a river ruffian to pilot a boat to go up stream
They find traces of Mandroid s human past with a picture of his wife and child
He can t yet remember who they are just yet That boat eventually crashes and they end up being captured by some Neanderthals presumably brought to the present by the time travelling 1 eyed mad scientist
After escaping the poorly costumed cavemen they come across a ninja who is out for revenge since he was the son of that random dead scientist at the beginning
He can manipulate time and space with his mind but only sometimes and for no reason
The River Ruffian Lt Yar Mandroid Owl2 D2 and the ninja find those old tank treads and uses them to attack the time travelling 1 eyed mad scientist s lair
Owl2 D2 and the tank treads bite the dust and they carry on inside the compound
The time travelling 1 eyed mad scientist then shows up now also a cyborg yet wearing gold armour he took from Ancient Rome since he wants to go back and be the Caesar of the time
Looking like Iron Man on acid he then shoots Force Lightning from his Roman shield and traps the crew in a shrinking net of electricity
Mandroid then sacrifices himself to save them
He dies
The Ninja Ruffian and Yar then go inside and send the time travelling 1 eyed mad Roman Iron Man scientist back to 430 000 000BC where he yells and shakes his cyborg hands to the sky in anger
They all just smile and then credits
The End
Awesome

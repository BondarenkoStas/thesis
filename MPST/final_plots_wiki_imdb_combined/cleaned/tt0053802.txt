The ancestral von Karnsteins were rumored to be vampires
So strong was that belief that the peasants revolted in 1765 and led by the village priest invaded the Karnstein cemetery drove stakes through the hearts of all the inhabitants and burned every corpse
One survived Carmilla von Karnstein Elsa Martinelli tells the story while pointing to a portrait hanging on the wall
Don t you think I look like her
The lady in question is Millarca von Karnstein saved on the eve of the massacre by her cousin and lover Ludwig von Karnstein who swore undying love for Millarca
But Ludwig proved to be unfaithful
Over their lifetimes he became engaged to three women
Each of them died shortly before the wedding
If Millarca were to return how do you think she would feel about me
asks Georgia Monte Verdi Annette Vadim fianc√©e of Carmilla s cousin Leopoldo von Karnstein Mel Ferrer
After all doesn t resemble Ludwig von Karnstein
Will she kill me like the others
Maybe this time she has come back for Ludwig says Carmilla Leopoldo breaks in
Carmilla enough he says you are frightening Georgia
You play the game too well
Whether it is a game or whether Carmilla believes the story it is obvious that she is in love with Leopoldo so much that she arrives late to his engagement party
She also arrives in Millarca s white wedding dress much to the dismay of all who know the Karnstein history
When fireworks set off from the deserted family cemetery accidentally ignite ammunition left by the Germans Carmilla is drawn to Mircalla s unearthed crypt
An exchange of souls seems to take place
The sight of Carmilla now makes animals frightened flowers wither in her cold hands she recognizes 17th century music the sun hurts her
Each night Carmilla goes to Millarca s grave to rest
One night she is spotted by one of the hired hands
The next morning a young servant is found dead
Talk of vampirism begins and suspicion falls on Carmilla When the wedding plans are suddenly moved from the family estate to Venice Carmilla seems to snap
The next morning Georgia awakens with two bites on her neck and memories of Carmilla attacking her
That afternoon as the army detonates the remaining ammunition left by the Germans in the Karnstein cemetery Carmilla is blown off a cliff and becomes staked on a tree branch
The diagnosis is that Carmilla escaped into a dream world where she became Mircalla and that she hoped by killing Georgia to become the one loved by Leopoldo Georgia and Leopoldo finally marry and as the honeymoon jet carries them from Rome to Paris Millarca narrates
No one suspects that Georgia is dead and that her body now belongs to Millarca
As proof the rose in Georgia s hand withers

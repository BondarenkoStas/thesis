At the insistence of his American born wife Aiko Yokohama salaryman Akira Saito decides to immigrate from Japan to the country of her birth to raise their two sons Takeshi and Tomoya and start their own business
Unbeknownst to his family Akira is in fact a highly skilled ninja who had faithfully protected the secrets of the temple minded by his adoptive father and sensei Kaga
Years before Akira s brother Shoji also raised and trained by Kaga sought to steal from the temple in disguise forcing Akira to engage him in battle and kill him
Akira s meditation on this matter is disrupted by an attack from Kaga to encourage him to wipe the guilt from his mind before it kills him
Akira announces his intentions to move to America to start a new life and to put the shadows of the ninja behind him
Kaga makes him swear never to reveal the secrets of their sect and gives him a ninja helmet as a parting gift but reminds him he can never leave his shadows behind
The Saitos land in Los Angeles and meet with Sam Green the widowed owner of a closed restaurant and apartment that Akira and Aiko planned to buy
After the sale is completed and the family visits the local mall the cigar store area of the building is broken into by police Sgt
Trumble a corrupt cop along with his partner Sgt
Joe Daly working for local mobster Mr Newman
Daly removes loose floor boards and puts a large white box underneath containing the Van Adda necklace
However he reconsiders and double crosses the mob by taking the necklace for himself
The next day Newman s enforcer Limehouse Willie waits until the building is again deserted before entering himself only to discover the necklace is missing
Seeing Sam Green s packed luggage in his car Willie incorrectly dedeuces that he s skipping town with the jewels and kills him even though he doesn t find them
Suspicion now falls on the Saitos
The next day as Akira and Aiko enjoy the first day of business Aiko s Japanese Restaurant Tomoya and Takeshi go out to the local store and are confronted by local bullies eyeing Takeshi s bike
Tomoya who has a red belt in karate defends his younger brother and bests the bullies
But during the fight Willie abducts Tomoya and leaves Takeshi with a broken nose when he tries to stop him
Willie then phones Akira demanding he delivers the necklace to Pier 25 in exchange for his son s life
Curious he goes into the cigar store room and finds the broken lock on the door the loose floor boards as well as a grey thread from Daly s suit jacket which also shows he is left handed
Akira arrives at the pier and boards one of the ships empty handed and is then restrained by Willie and his men for interrogation
Willie doesn t believe Akira s claims that it was a left handed man in a grey suit that took the necklace and cuts him with his knife across his chest
But when he threatens his son with a blow torch Akira smashes the light above his head and uses his ninja skills to escape with Tomoya
He listens to Aiko s insistence and goes to the police the next day
Meanwhile although Willie is convinced that the necklace isn t with the Saitos Newman still wants them eliminated for what they know
Akira leaves the house with instructions to his family to stay indoors
At the precinct he speaks with Lt Anderson with both Trumble and Daly present as he identifies Willie in the provided mug shots
Anderson can do nothing to keep him away from the Saitos without evidence and Akira agrees to help him
Daly informs Newman and is assured Willie will clean up his mess but informs him they need to have a little chat
Back at the apartment Takeshi accidentally kicks his soccer ball out the window and Tomoya goes out to recover it despite his mother s insistence
Aiko chases after him and both are run down by Newman s thugs stationed outside
Akira arrives seconds afterwards and because they had been ordered to switch vehicles to confirm they killed Aiko and Tomoya recognizes the thugs from the night before and gives chase in his car then on foot
The resulting struggle while their truck is moving results in both men being killed
At the hospital Tomoya s on life support while Aiko is bruised and shaken but still being kept overnight for observation
Anderson arranges for police personnel to guard them
Akira sneaks on board Willie s ship during a party and after subduing his security cuts the power and sneaks up behind him
With a knife to his throat he warns him to stay away from the Saitos or he will pray for death
Akira is gone by the time the lights go on
Instead of heeding his warning Willie sneaks into the hospital and manages to snuff out Aiko but is stopped by Anderson and his men before he can kill Tomoya and escapes
Akira returns to the hospital and has a moment alone with his wife s body
He swears he will make Willie and his men pay for destroying their dreams by returning to the shadows of the ninja
He takes Tomoya out of hospital care against Anderson s warnings that they can t guarantee police protection
Fed up with the incompetence of the police Akira only warns him to stay out of his way
Elsewhere Daly and Trumble meet at a restaurant where Willie also shows up and murders them both for their treachery
Akira relocates the boys to a warehouse
Behind closed doors he performs rituals that signify his return to the ways of ninjitsu and with a makeshift forge creates a new katana blade while Takeshi finds ninja weapons in Akira s belongings
In full ninja garb Akira prays to Aiko before donning the helmet his father bequeathed to him before leaving Japan

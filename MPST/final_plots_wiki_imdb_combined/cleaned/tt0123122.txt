It s Flashbeagle Charlie Brown takes the form of a musical presenting a series of different songs
The program does not have a strong unifying plot
The program begins with Snoopy defeating Peppermint Patty at football followed by an opening credits sequence in which the dog takes out a boom box and dances to the title song as the opening credits roll
The next segment shows Peppermint Patty and Marcie at school followed by a gym class in which Peppermint Patty leads the other characters in a workout while she sings I m in Shape
The part of the song where she sings Hey Linus
is clearly inspired by Toni Basil s 1982 hit song Mickey
The scene changes to a party at the home of Sally and Charlie Brown
The children begin playing a game of Simon Says before Lucy takes over the game and sings Lucy Says
Later the children dance to a song about Pig Pen The Pig Pen Hoedown
The song Flashbeagle is repeated two more times
Snoopy is first seen selecting outfits finally deciding on an old T shirt which he rips part of to form a headband and legwarmers then heading to a discoth√®que with Franklin and dancing to the tune there where the first two verses of the song are played and Snoopy wins applause from the club goers to the background of multicolored lights
The next morning Snoopy is sleeping atop his doghouse exhausted from the night before to which Charlie Brown berates him for oversleeping while others work
Sally Brown takes a groggy Snoopy to school for Show and Tell
After one boy talks about his pet chameleon Sally is up but Snoopy lies there motionless
However when the owner of the chameleon plays his boom box which has the third and final verse of Flashbeagle Snoopy gets up and starts dancing and all the children gradually join in
The special ends with Charlie Brown saying to his sister that he thinks he should do something about his dog s behavior
Sally disagrees with him because thanks to Snoopy she got an A for Show and Tell

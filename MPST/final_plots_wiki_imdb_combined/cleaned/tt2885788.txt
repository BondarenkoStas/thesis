In 1910 a legendary old bounty hunter named Silas Greaves enters a saloon in Abilene Kansas and regales the patrons with tales of his adventures in exchange for free drinks
The patrons Steve Jack and a teenager named Dwight awe struck at first grow increasingly incredulous and irritated the more they listen to his ludicrous stories in which he takes credit for the killings of numerous legendary outlaws including Butch Cassidy and Newman Haynes Clanton
At the end just as the patrons are about to become fully enraged by Silas over the top accounts of his travels he reveals that Ben the bartender is in fact Roscoe Bob Bryant one of the three bandits that murdered Silas brothers and set him on the path of a bounty hunter
The player is then given a choice whether to challenge Bob to a duel thus fulfilling Silas vendetta at long last or letting him go in which case Silas finally lets go of the hate and anger that has been driving him for years
The ending reveals that Dwight is indeed Dwight Eisenhower on his way to West Point
If the player chooses the redemption option and forgives Bob for his actions Silas reveals he had been deliberately exaggerating his tales to confirm his suspicions with details Ben would know only if he were Roscoe
Silas then asks Dwight what he plans to do with his life and upon hearing that he s becoming a soldier Silas says Well you do it right then son
Don t tear down the world out of anger and spite like I did
You build it up
You do something decent with your life
You hear me
to which Dwight says Sir yes sir and sets out to become the 34th president of the United States and if the player chooses the revenge option Silas duels with Bob with Silas emerging as the victor
Everyone present at the bar becomes cautious to Silas with Dwight being highly disturbed

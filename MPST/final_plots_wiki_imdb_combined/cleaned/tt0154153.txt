On the night of 11 October 1943 the Japanese bombed the Indian city of Madras causing commotion all over the city
In Triplicane the next morning Rajan a radio engineer and communications researcher is found murdered with his own hand gun
His neighbor Chinnaiah Pillai hears the gunshot and complains to the police
A local Police Inspector named Purushothaman Naidu arrives and investigates the scene
He is joined by C I D
officer Sivanandam there
He concludes that the killer is some petty thief who must have shot Rajan for the lump of money found in the same room of the crime scene
However Sivanandam states that to be of a bad solution as the amount of money matches exactly with the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in the same room without a single rupee s difference
Nonetheless it was clear Rajan was making plans to leave Chennai in anticipation of the bombings
Rajan s wife Usha is almost dumbstruck and unable to speak during any inquiries
Sivanandam and Naidu feel reluctant and embarrassed to do any questioning to her The two decide to investigate the case by questioning the people in and around the house who are the family members or friends of Rajan
They first do their inquiry with Chinnaiah Pillai the neighbour as he is the first to inform them
He tells that the killer could probably be Pattabi Rajan s younger brother
He recounts an incident in which Pattabi confronts Rajan at the house s garage to ask for his share of the family property to be apportioned and given to him
Rajan in good faith denies to give Pattabi his share feeling that he and his wife might squander it
Chinnaiah concludes that this would have kindled Pattabi to kill Rajan Sivanandam and Naidu decide to inquire Pattabi
However Pattabi had rushed to the Beach before their arrival probably to commit suicide
They rush there themselves to inquire him
When questioned Pattabi feels remorseful of his brother s death
He states that he did treat his brother well when he was alive and did not understand his good intentions
He recounts another incident where his wife Hema had fought with him herself during dinner for the apportionment of property herself
She is also a person who loses sanity when overpowered by anger
Pattabi believes of a very good possibility that Hema used the Rajan s gun to shoot him for the money Sivanamdam parts to meet Hema soon after to do his inquiry
Hema was initially impudent and refusing to give her statement of the crime but later gives in when threatened to be arrested for the same
She reveals a secret of Rajan
Rajan has had extramarital affair with a dancer named Ambujam
She knew this when she once found and overheard Rajan and Ambujam speaking together a week before the murder where Ambujam unveils that she is pregnant
Rajan treats the news with a reckless attitude infuriating Ambujam
Hema had received a letter addressed to Rajan from Ambujam that had the address No 15 Thoni Street
Hema proposes that Ambujam could have killed Rajan in retaliation to Rajan s lack of concern for her Fatigued with the case s complicated nature Naidu compares it with a supposed Peruvala Vaikal in Trichy a river that has a lot of twists and turns
Sivanandam makes a better analogy of the case to the story of blind men and an elephant where each suspect has a different and contrasting opinion to offer
In Thoni Street Ambujam has made preparations to leave Chennai at the news of Rajan s death
Half an hour after her departure Sivanandam and Naidu arrive there to find the house locked
They take with them Shanmugam a boy in the street to the Police Station to inquire him on the physical features of Ambujam to locate and recognize her
The boy knows and has seen her leave from Thoni Street
In a coincidence Ambujam s bullock cart and another car strike each other in a road accident right in front of the very same police station
They identify and inquire Ambujam Ambujam accuses Chinnaiah of the murder
She explains that Chinnaiah was her foster father who wanted her to stay away from Rajan
She started loving after the trio s meeting on a picnic
When their relationship started deepening Chinnaiah got infuriated and wanted put an end to the affair
Ambujam gives a strong opinion that it must have been Chinnaiah who killed Rajan Sivanandam does his homework by developing the film roll found in Rajan s camera collecting and comparing all of the suspects and others fingerprints with those found in Rajan s shoes finding a teardrop mark in Rajan s shoes and finding broken bangle pieces on the crime scene
He finds them further complicating the case and coming nowhere near the conclusion
He gets small clue at a sharbat shop apparently making no sense
He make inquiries to Rajan s college principal Ranganathan who has a high opinion of both Rajan and Usha his wife both being his alumni
He says Rajan once broke into the college at night to complete an experiment for which he never felt guilty and also Usha once put up the Indian flag as part of Freedom Movement and she accepted doing it herself
This emphasizes her patriotism Sivanandam inquires finally Usha
She narrates an incident during college where Rajan spoke of individualistic needs that are equally as important as the country s freedom
He managed to convince the entire crowd of his viewpoint who previously opined the opposite
However he was bullied and disdained when Usha took over and changed the crowd back to giving your life for the nation
Usha further tells Sivanandam on how she and Rajan came to love each other
In the process he tricks into collecting Usha s fingerprints with a leaky fountain pen On that eve Sivanandam meets all the suspects along with Naidu at Rajan s residence
He caries our an exercise wherein the suspects including Usha must shoot Sivanandam assuming that he is Rajan
They are given revolver s with false bullets
Usha is unable to shoot
Then Sivanandam orders an arrest of Pattabi and Hema
Unable to bear the torture Usha comes out with the truth
On the day of the murder when she entered the room she found Rajan working with something meticulously with a radio equipment powered by a generator
She doubts of something suspicious
The second time she enters she discovers that he is part of the terrorist activity of bombing Chennai communicating to the Japanese bombers
He is a key part of the bombing
Out of her extreme patriotism for her nation and unable to bear the injustice she tries to talk and mend Rajan s ways
However Rajan feeling that he should help the Japanese and does not mind betraying his own country
Usha attempts to shoot Rajan whose plan is to escape to Japan in a submarine after the bombing for which he had packed the money
However in an accident fighting for the gun the trigger is accidentally pressed killing Rajan
She has cried at his boots later holding them explaining the fingerprints and teardrop stain Sivanandam and Naidu ask for the papers Rajan used to hatch the bombing plan
She goes inside to fetch them
Sivanandam tells Naidu that the fingerprints on the boots and hers which he collected matched which led him to suspect her
Also her failure to shoot during the exercise confirms the fact
When Usha takes a long time to come back the two hear a long silence followed by a gunshot and run inside
Sivanandam shouts Usha
followed by a screen closing behind them

In 1957 the Dollanganger family lives an idyllic life in Gladstone Pennsylvania
After Christopher Sr the children s father dies in a car accident his wife Corrine and their four children are left deep in debt
As Corrine has no work skills the family is forced to move in with her estranged wealthy parents who live at Foxworth Hall in Virginia
Corrine explains to the children that she has been estranged from her parents because of something she did when she was 18
She then adds that their true family name is Foxworth not Dollanganger
Upon arrival Corrine s mother Olivia sneaks the family into a small bedroom that connects to the attic and insists the children must be hidden from their grandfather
Olivia treats the children with disdain and threatens to severely punish them for any disobedience
Corrine meets with her father and when she returns to the children she has been savagely whipped by Olivia who then tells the children that their parents were half uncle and niece
Corrine confirms this and explains her plan to win back her father s love so she can introduce the children to him
The older children Cathy and Chris turn the attic into an imaginary garden for the twins Carrie and Cory educate the twins as best they can and read books to keep up their own education
At first Corrine visits her children every day sometimes bringing expensive gifts but as the days and weeks turn into months her visits become less and less frequent
Meanwhile the grandmother physically and emotionally abuses the children and constantly threatens to whip them for doing anything she considers sinful
When Christmas comes Corrine allows Cathy and Chris to watch the Christmas ball from a hiding spot where they see their grandfather Malcolm for the first time
They also see their mother with their father s attorney Bart Winslow who is helping draw up Malcolm s will
When Corrine discovers Chris was wandering around the mansion she slaps him and threatens to whip him and Cathy then immediately apologizes and promises to make amends to them for their confinement
While Chris believes her Cathy points out how their mother has changed and worries that Corrine no longer cares about them
A year later Cathy and Chris have both entered puberty and taken on parental roles with Carrie and Cory who no longer recognise Corrine
While Cathy and Chris are both entering adulthood the twins have stopped growing altogether due to being imprisoned and the lack of sunlight and fresh air in their prison
Olivia catches Chris staring at Cathy in her brassiere in the bathroom and orders him to cut off Cathy s hair or all four children will starve
Chris refuses but Olivia drugs Cathy and pours tar into her hair
She then abandons them for three weeks driving the children to near starvation
Cathy ends up cutting off her hair and when Olivia see this she starts leaving them sugar powdered doughnuts with their usual food
Corrine visits the children for the first time in six months announcing that she has married Bart Winslow and they have returned from their honeymoon in Europe
Cathy and Chris react angrily accusing her of abandoning them and Corrine refuses to visit again until they apologize
Olivia continues to abuse the children even whipping Cathy and Chris after he talks back to her
Cathy and Chris become physically attracted towards each other and start to fall in love in spite of their mutual shame
Alarmed by the twins declining health and mistrustful of their mother Cathy and Chris plan to escape
They begin to sneak into their mother s room to steal money and valuables
One night Cathy goes down alone and finds her stepfather sleeping in the bed
Curious she kisses him
When Chris overhears Bart talking about this dream to Corrine he is enraged at Cathy and rapes her
Afterwards feeling guilty and ashamed he apologizes and Cathy forgives him by saying she wanted it too
Chris confesses that he loves her and although Cathy reciprocates his feelings she is unsure how to respond
Cory becomes sick and Cathy demands that Corrine take him to the hospital
Corrine slaps her but Cathy retaliates and threatens revenge if they do not help Cory
Olivia seemingly sides with Cathy and they take Cory away
The next day Corrine returns and tells them that Cory died from pneumonia
Carrie goes into shock and stops speaking
Chris goes to Corrine s room for money but finds that his mother and Bart have moved out
He then overhears the head butler talking about how Malcolm died seven months ago and how Olivia has been leaving doughnuts sprinkled with rat poison in the attic because it is infested with mice
Chris and Cathy give Cory s pet mouse a doughnut to confirm the story
When the mouse dies they finally flee the house with Carrie and catch a train to Florida
At the train station Chris reveals to Cathy that he discovered their mother s inheritance is conditional on having no children from her first marriage and that if this were ever proven she would lose everything
Their mother has been poisoning them for nine months to secure her inheritance
Chris and Cathy decide against contacting the police their main concern is to stay together and be there for Carrie
Chris assures Cathy that they can make a new life without their mother but Cathy swears that she will get revenge one day

The show was commissioned following Conley s last successful comedy series Brian Conley This Way Up
The show lasted for four series although a live special was shown a year after the series ended and a Christmas special aired a year after that
Shows were broadcast Saturdays on ITV between 22 February 1992 and 22 July 1995
Repeats began to show a few years later on the now defunct Granada Plus though episodes stopped showing on the channel a few years before it closed and has since never been broadcast again
Extracts from various episodes were uploaded to a dedicated YouTube channel but was subsequently closed due to copyright claims
The show was a mix of comedy music sketches and variety acts
The first two series were recorded in the Churchill Theatre in Bromley rather than a television studio giving the show a live feel
Conley would perform musical numbers stand up routines and sketches the latter of which were performed on sets that were wheeled out onto the stage and he d often change costume in front of the audience
Series three and four were filmed in The London Studios and given a new look
Sketches were now performed on a rotating platform that switched between different sets as it spun
However Conley s trademark characters were either performed on their own set or were pre recorded
Conley decided that the fourth series would be the last when in an interview with TV Times he decided to pursue a career on stage
However after Conley compered the Royal Variety Performance in 1999 the show returned in 2000 albeit in a chat show format dramatically different to the original show
Whilst it retained Conely s stand up sets at the beginning of the show as well as his special guests sketches and Conley s characters were removed from the show
Whilst this had some fans unhappy the show managed to pull in some famous guests including Leslie Nielsen and Kathleen Turner
The revival lasted for three series

The elderly and pious Protestant sisters Martine and Philippa live in a small village on the remote western coast of Jutland in 19th century Denmark
Their father was a pastor who founded his own Pietistic conventicle
With their father now dead and the austere sect drawing no new converts the aging sisters preside over a dwindling congregation of white haired believers
The story flashes back 49 years showing the sisters in their youth
The beautiful girls have many suitors but their father rejects them all and indeed derides marriage
Each daughter is courted by an impassioned suitor visiting Jutland Martine by a charming young Swedish cavalry officer Lorens Löwenhielm and Philippa by a star baritone Achille Papin from the Paris opera on hiatus to the silence of the coast
Both sisters decide to stay with their father and spurn any life away from Jutland
Thirty five years later Babette Hersant appears at their door
She carries only a letter from Papin explaining that she is a refugee from counter revolutionary bloodshed in Paris and recommending her as a housekeeper
The sisters cannot afford to take Babette in but she offers to work for free
Babette serves as their cook for the next 14 years producing an improved version of the bland meals typical of the abstemious nature of the congregation and slowly gaining their respect
Her only link to her former life is a lottery ticket that a friend in Paris renews for her every year
One day she wins the lottery of 10 000 francs
Instead of using the money to return to Paris and her lost lifestyle she decides to spend it preparing a delicious dinner for the sisters and their small congregation on the occasion of the founding pastor s hundredth birthday
More than just a feast the meal is an outpouring of Babette s appreciation an act of self sacrifice Babette tells no one that she is spending her entire winnings on the meal
The sisters accept both Babette s meal and her offer to pay for the creation of a real French dinner
Babette arranges for her nephew a merchant to go to Paris and gather the supplies for the feast
The ingredients are plentiful sumptuous and exotic and their arrival causes much discussion among the villagers
As the various never before seen ingredients arrive and preparations commence the sisters begin to worry that the meal will become a sin of sensual luxury if not some form of devilry
In a hasty conference the sisters and the congregation agree to eat the meal but to forgo speaking of any pleasure in it and to make no mention of the food during the dinner
Martine s former suitor Lorens now a famous general married to a member of the Queen s court comes as the guest of his aunt the local lady of the manor and a member of the old pastor s congregation
He is unaware of the other guests austere plans and as a man of the world and former attaché in Paris he is the only person at the table qualified to comment on the meal
He regales the guests with abundant information about the extraordinary food and drink comparing it to a meal he enjoyed years earlier at the famous Café Anglais in Paris
Although the other celebrants refuse to comment on the earthly pleasures of their meal Babette s gifts break down their distrust and superstitions elevating them physically and spiritually
Old wrongs are forgotten ancient loves are rekindled and a mystical redemption of the human spirit settles over the table
The sisters assume that Babette will now return to Paris
However when she tells them that all of her money is gone and that she is not going anywhere the sisters are aghast
Babette then reveals that she was formerly the head chef of the Café Anglais and tells them that dinner for 12 there has a price of 10 000 francs
Martine tearfully says Now you will be poor the rest of your life to which Babette replies An artist is never poor
Philippa then says But this is not the end Babette
In Paradise you will be the great artist God meant you to be and then embraces her with tears in her eyes saying Oh how you will enchant the angels
which is precisely how the short story ends

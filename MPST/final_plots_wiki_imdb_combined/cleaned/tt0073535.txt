Policeman Jean Letellier is under pressure because the infamous gangster Marcucci escaped from him publicly
Moreover during the pursuit an innocent bystander was killed by a stray bullet
Letellier is investigated for having fired the deadly bullet
Before Letellier is cleared a serial killer begins to murder young women each time leaving a weird message at the site of crime
He calls himself Minos referring to the Divine Comedy
The murderer always declares he had punished his victims for what he considers their impure life style
While Letellier still has no trace of Minos he comes across Marcucci s current whereabouts
Just as before Marcucci tries to escape in a spectacular manner when Letellier confronts him
But this time Marcucci dies in the course of action
Marcucci s death is no relief for Letellier who is now publicly accused of having neglected the Minos case in favour of settling his personal feud with his late archenemy
Minos keeps on murdering and leaving provoking hints until Letellier can identify him
The serial killer can only scarcely elude Letellier who chases him over the roofs of Paris
His next coup is to take hostages in a skyscraper
Letellier decides he has had it and goes airborne
From a flying helicopter he jumps through the window into the flat and puts Minos down

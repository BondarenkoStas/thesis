The basics of the show are formatted as a real karaoke machine
Various college contestants compete by singing a popular song with the music video played at the same time as well as lyrics playing at the bottom of the screen
At times there are two contestants that compete together
Afterwards they are rated by the judges on a 1 10 with plastic number signs the rating number is also the number of points they have earned
Similar to other competitions the finalists end up in first second and third position which depends on the number of points they have earned

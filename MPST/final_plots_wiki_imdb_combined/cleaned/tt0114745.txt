During World War II Hannibal Lee traveling by train to Tuskegee Alabama is joined by fellow flight cadet candidates Billy Train Roberts Walter Peoples III and Lewis Johns
At the start of their training they are met by Colonel Noel Rogers the commander of the base Major Sherman Joy director of training and First Lieutenant Glenn liaison officer
The cadets are briefed by Rogers Joy both with their own views that set the tone for what the cadets would later face in training Rogers has an optimistic view of the cadets wanting the cadets to prove the naysayers wrong and letting them know how much of an honor it would be for the cadets to pass the training and earn their wings as aviators
Major Joy however reflects the views of most of white America s thoughts at the time belittling the cadets and questioning whether or not they were up to the task
Afterward Lt Glenn told the cadets that he hoped they took note of the differing views of the two different officers
Later that evening the cadets are chatting amongst themselves and began to introduce themselves and what their college majors were
It was during this time where Walter Peoples guaranteed that no one s name would be called above his on graduation day
While the cadets begin their classes Major Joy began his ploy to discredit the cadets
During a classroom session Joy had them to retake the same flight exam they had to take to get into the program to begin with
Later he takes Peoples on a flight after it is revealed that Peoples has a commercial pilot license
Joy takes the training aircraft a PT 17 through very tricky and dangerous moves in order to try and break People s will but the tactic didn t work which seemed to frustrate Joy even more
Afterwards Major Joy had to explain to Colonel Rogers on why he decided to give the retest and Joy s beliefs that some of the cadets may have cheated to get in the program
Rogers informed Joy that no one scored less than a 95 on the retest and scourned Joy about his tactics
After a briefing with the cadets Major Joy sends each cadet up on flights in their PT 17 training aircraft with an instructor pilot
It would end tragically for cadet Johns as he struggled to get his aircraft out of a stall
The instructor also tries to regain control but it was too late as the plane crashed into a building exploding on impact and killing both Johns and his instructor
Afterwards cadet Leroy Cappy begins to let self doubt creep in after seeing John s deadly crash watching others leave the program
Cadets Lee Peoples give Cappy a stern pep talk telling him not to quit
The cadets continue on with their training flying with their instructor pilots and controlling the planes on their own
Major Joy even let cadet Lee make several solo flights around the base
While watching a film on air combat Lt Glen steps in and begins to teach the cadets
Cadet Peoples questioned Lt Glen on why he not Major Joy was teaching air combat class
At this point Lt Glen reveals to the cadets that he had joined the Royal Canadian Air Force where he was credited with three kills making him the only Army Air Corps officer on the base with actual air combat experience
Peoples and Lee flying solo each in the AT 6 Texan training plane take part in a mock dogfight where Peoples gets an edge on Lee and shoots him down
Afterwards Peoples performs some unauthorized aerobatic maneuvers in order to impress Hannibal but this also caught the attention of Colonel Rogers Major Joy and results in him being removed from the training program
Peoples admitted to Colonel Rogers and Major Joy that he made a mistake pleaded with them not to put him out of the program but to no avail
To avoid going home in disgrace an emotionally distraught Peoples commandeers an AT 6 takes off with it and commits suicide by deliberately crashing it
Back at the cadets barracks tensions and emotions following Peoples death began to reach the boiling point
Cadet Roberts has a heated exchange with cadet Lee on Major Joy s tactics saying that Joy set out to break Peoples and killed him like putting a carbine to his head
Cadet Cappy again letting his own self doubts creep back in sides with Roberts against Lee saying that he doesn t see any reason to continue on if Major Joy was going to stick with his attempts to break them as well
Cadet Lee fired back saying that Major Joy s gameplan was to make them quit and that he wasn t falling for it
He emphatically said that he wasn t going to let Major Joy anyone else at the base or the God damned Commander In Chief himself stop him from his dreams of flying
Lt Glen and cadets Lee Roberts Cappy are on a routine training mission when Cappy s plane begins to experience trouble
Cappy Lee land on a country road where a prison chain gang are out working in a roadside field
As the planes are coming in to land the prison guards over the gang force the prisoners out of the way to make room for the planes to land
The guards stand with a mixed look of praise curiosity when the cadets exit the aircraft their emotions turn to utter shock when Lee Cappy take their flight masks off revealing themselves as Black aviators
The cadets go on to successfully earn their wings and are commissioned as 2nd Lieutenants in the Army Air Corps
Later First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt arrives for an inspection
She chooses Lee to take her up in an aircraft
The men are eventually deployed to North Africa as part of the 99th Pursuit Squadron though they are relegated to ground attack missions
During the campaign Lee s flight encounters a group of Messerschmitt Bf 109s
Ignoring Lee s orders Cappy breaks formation and attacks downing one of them
Another Bf 109 hits Cappy s fighter aircraft numerous times causing a fire in the cockpit and fatally wounding him
Unfortunately Cappy is killed when his damaged fighter plane crashes after catching fire
A congressional hearing of the House Armed Services Committee is convened to determine whether the Tuskegee Airmen experiment should continue
Charged with being incompetent a medical study is used to claim that Negroes are incapable of handling complex machinery
The hearing decides in the Tuskegee Airmen s favor due to testimony by their commanding officer Lt Col Benjamin O Davis and the 99th Pursuit Squadron joins two new squadrons out of Tuskegee to form the all black 332nd Fighter Group under the now Col Benjamin O Davis
The 332nd is deployed to Ramitelli Italy to provide escort for Boeing B 17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers which are experiencing heavy losses
During this deployment Lee and Billy Roberts sink a destroyer
They also rescue a straggling B 17 which is being attacked by two German fighters while returning from a bombing raid shooting down both of the enemy Bf 109s
When the bomber s pilot and co pilot travel to Ramitelli to thank them the B 17 pilot refuses to believe that black pilots saved them
During a subsequent escort assignment Roberts is shot down
Later Lee is awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for sinking the destroyer and promoted to captain
Having by then earned the respect and admiration of the white bomber pilots the Tuskegee Airmen are specifically requested for escort for a raid on Berlin a request advanced in a mission briefing by the same pilot who originally refused to believe that the 332nd had helped his plane

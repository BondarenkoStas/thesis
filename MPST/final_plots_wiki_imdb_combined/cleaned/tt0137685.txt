The play begins with an invocation to lord Ganesha
Then the Brahmins of Pune introduce themselves and we can see the morally corrupt state of affairs in Pune
Nana Phadnavis who is the Diwan of Pune is also corrupt and visits the lavani dancer
Ghashiram is working with the lavani dancer
Ghashiram being a Brahmin goes to collect alms at the Peshwa s festival the next day
However he is ill treated there and is charged with pick pocketing and imprisoned for the offence
He then decides to take revenge
So the play continues on to reach the next part of this play
Ghashiram barters his own daughter to get the post of Kotwal of Pune from Nana
Having got the post he begins to enforce strict rules in the city
He starts asking for permits for everything and starts throwing people in jail for the smallest offences
In the mean time Ghashiram s daughter is impregnated by Nana and dies during childbirth
The situation goes out of hand when a few people in the jail die from suffocation
The Brahmins then complain to the Peshwa
The Peshwa summons Nana who orders Ghashiram to be killed in the most inhumane way possible

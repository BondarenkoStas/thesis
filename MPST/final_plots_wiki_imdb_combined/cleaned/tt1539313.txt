Footage on the news shows what seems like proof of a paranormal event
Twelve days earlier on December 9 2012 a conspiracy themed radio show takes a call from a man who claims to work at Area 51
After the caller describes a secret civilization on the moon he is cut off
George Larson the host dismisses it as a hoax until he receives a photo album that contains enough evidence that he hires a documentary crew headed by Matt and Sonny to investigate the claims
Matt and Sonny realize a decades old Polaroid photograph depicts a man in modern clothing on the back it has a series of numbers written on it
They decode these as GPS coordinates that are less than an hour away from where they leave in Louisiana
There they find a hatch that leads to an underground warehouse
After searching the mostly empty structure they find a mysterious device none of them can identify
Intrigued they grab it and flee what they believe are approaching people
Documentation provides little explanation of the device but identifies it as a harness and allows them to turn it on this turns out to be disastrous
Sonny who is wearing the harness disappears for a second and suffers injuries that require a brief hospitalization
Worried that they are over their heads they take the harness to Dr Orin Raymond a local professor
While examining it Dr Raymond finds a glowing green crystal he identifies as found only on the moon
As they leave a member of the Church of Lunology harasses them and hands them a flyer
Interviewees describe the Church of Lunology which claims to be the fastest growing religion
Members believe that a civilization lives on the moon and the US government has been covering it up
While Matt and Sonny investigate a Church of Lunology building one of their camera operators Nate takes exterior shots
Separately both groups are confronted by Church of Lunology members who demand the return of their time machine
The filmmakers regroup and flee chased by the Lunology members
Unable to outrun the Lunology members the filmmakers stop their car and demand an explanation
Instead the Lunology members car takes off into the sky
Stunned and unsure of what happened the filmmakers debate what to do next
A note leads them to David James a former member of the lunar colony who explains its history
The lunar colony and Church of Lunology are separate the colonists are from the future and Lunology cultists are normal people
Using the lunar rock J Ari Hilliard invents immortality and time travel and on December 21 2012 he sends the first mission back to 350 BC where they begin changing the timeline
This created unintended changes resulting in a desire to repeatedly tinker with the timeline
Dissidents opposed this fearing it could result in more unintended changes and weakened dimensional barriers between the changed timelines
The scientists rationalizations became Lunology
Hilliard himself disillusioned left the lunar colony and tried to reveal the truth to no avail
Convinced that immortality was too great a power for any one person he tried to murder himself before he could become immortal
The lunar colony wise to his plans prevented his first attempt in 1947 when he was born
His next attempt resulted in the Roswell UFO incident as he fled the lunar colony back to Earth with the crystal
The crystal exists only in one place across all timelines so the lunar colony must recover it before they can time travel any further
When Lunologists track down James the filmmakers flee
Dr Raymond and Larson both disappear
When the filmmakers return to the spot where they found the harness it seems to have changed
James recommends they give the crystal to Hilliard himself
The CEO of Lunology plays stupid but they set up a meeting with Hilliard
At the meeting James reveals himself as the immortal future version of Hilliard
Hilliard says the crystal was a test James comes to the realization that they failed the test and kills Hilliard his alternative self to prevent further time travel
In a possible alternate timeline people discover the documentary footage
Meanwhile the anachronistic man from the Polaroid walks into the meeting room with both timelines intertwining behind him and picks up the crystal
He also picks up the camera and stares into it with his eyes glowing green momentarily behind his sunglasses

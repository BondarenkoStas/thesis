The film opens in 2016 B C
with Sarman a young man from the ancient village of Amri who lost his parents when young
Sarman s uncle gives him an amulet that contains an inscription of a unicorn Sarman sees in his dreams
This animal is also the emblem of the city of Mohenjo Daro
Arriving in Mohenjo Daro to sell his wares Sarman learns that the city is ruled by the tyrant chief Maham and his wicked son Moonja
Maham proposes to impose an additional tax on the farmers but Sarman leads the farmers to oppose the taxes so that their families don t starve
Sarman gains access to the upper city by showing his uncle s amulet and falls in love with Chaani daughter of the head priest of Mohenjo Daro
The head priest strangely appears to recognize him
Chaani reveals that she has been forcibly betrothed to Moonja
Maham realizes Sarman and Chaani love each other and that Sarman is the leader of the tax revolt
Realizing that the people are rallying behind him Maham gives Sarman the Bakar Zokhar challenge
Sarman proposes that if he wins Chaani will be released from her engagement
It is accepted
The head priest reveals to Sarman how Maham was expelled from Harappa for illegal trade with Sumerians
Maham entered Mohenjo Daro as a trader and quickly rose to become the trade chief
Maham had discovered that the mighty Sindhu river held vast gold deposits so he decided to dam the river and divert its course to mine the gold
The wise Senate Chief Srujan opposed this but Maham built the dam anyway and had Srujan framed and arrested for hoarding gold
Chaani s father and Durjan Sarman s uncle were threatened by Maham to go against Srujan and Srujan was killed
Maham then took his place as the new Senate Chief
The head priest then reveals that Sarman is Srujan s son
It is now up to Sarman to purge the evil Maham
Sarman faces the ferocious Tajik mountain cannibals Bakar and Zokhar in an arena before the city
After a vicious battle he kills one of the cannibals but spares the other and the people of Mohenjo Daro surge even stronger behind him
Enraged Maham urges Moonja to finish off Chaani and the priest
Moonja kills the priest but Sarman saves Chaani and kills Moonja
Chaani exposes Maham s plan to use the gold from the Sindhu to enrich himself and to smuggle in weapons from the West
All the chiefs now stand against Maham
The people elect Sarman as the new chief but Sarman suggests Mohenjo Daro needs a people s government not a chief
Sarman realizes that the dam will burst and the Sindhu River will flood the city
He rallies the people to lash boats together and form a floating bridge
They evacuate Mohenjo Daro and cross to the other side of the river
The dam collapses and Maham chained in the city square is drowned
The once renowned Mohenjo Daro is no more
The survivors migrate to another river which Sarman names Ganga

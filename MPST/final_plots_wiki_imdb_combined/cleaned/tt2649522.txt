The drama revolves around Will Burton a talented junior barrister of peerless intellect and winning charm who specialises in spiriting people out of tight legal corners
He is in high demand as he has never lost a case
But when his talents acquit the notorious prime suspect in an horrific murder trial that brilliance comes back to bite him with unexpected and chilling results not to mention a shocking twist in the talevhavnal 2013 A man runs through a rainy downtown London and hails a taxi
The driver eyes him suspiciously as the man talks about cocaine in a hold all and a double barreled shotgun
The man apologizes to the driver saying hes a lawyer The man sits in front of a group of students on career day
When the teacher asks who knows what a barrister is the mans own son Jamie answers that the barrister stops people from going to prison even if the evidence may be circumspect and that may sometimes keep him from coming on holiday as promised
Mr Burton clarifies that he basically talks to a judge in a court
He gives an example about how he would help if a student is accused by a classmate of stealing a pen his job would be to convince the jury that the witness was mistaken
When another student asks what would happen if the accused actually DID take the pen but denies it Burton answers that the student would be guilty but that it would bring reasonable doubt to the case
Jamie points out that the student would be getting away with it
The questioner replies only if Jamies dad was on his side A female barrister looks through a file as she is being driven to the Central Criminal Courthouse
Burton arrives at the CCC and is told that Maggie Gardner will be prosecuting
Burton asks again In the courtroom Gardner the female barrister for the prosecution argues to the judge that the accuseds wielding a hunting knife was NOT an act of defense the clue being the word hunting
Burton counters that sometimes a pre emptive strike is allowed by law especially as in this case when the victim had a shotgun pointed to his head
After the case the accused now free offers to shake Burtons hand which Burton takes after a long pause As a news report plays on about an unsolved brutal ritualistic murder and how the police was still asking for witnesses to come forward a man walks between several aviaries inside his house sprinkling seed through the chicken wire
He sits down to eat when theres a banging at the door it is the police with a warrant
The man annoyed screams for them to come back after breakfast
The police storm in Burton runs into Gardner in the courthouse and she congratulates him
She is skeptical when he claims he doesnt know what shes talking about
He walks away grinning gnawing on an apple At the office Mayfield a senior hands Burton a glossy magazine where Burton has been deemed the number one barrister under 40 Margaret Maggie Gardner is second
A clerk ribs Burton about applying for Silk
Gardner back in the car leafs through the article with a glum expression The clerk hands Burton who is on his way out a large stack of documents
Burton demurs saying his is on his way to his cottage for the weekend
A senior barrister walks by and asks Burton to take a look at it adding that the solicitor Brown asked for Burton himself
Burton wonders aloud why Brown would ask him over a Silk
The senior says if someone was to be chained inside a safe in a shark tank they would want the assistance of someone like Houdini Burton walks quickly along a soccer field as a mother yells at the boys playing a match
He kisses her and she is surprised to see him
As they watch Jamies shot on goal goes wide and bounces off the post
After the game Burton says he found an apple in his pocket his wife says she is trying to get him to eat something that is not made of cheese At home Burton struggles with the dishwasher
His wife comes by and works the controls easily
Burton finishes packing his overnight bag almost forgetting the stack of documents he was given
They reach the cottage and unpack
The wife puts Jamie to sleep
Burton makes tea and grabs the documents but his wife entices him to join her in the bath
He sets the tea and the documents down
Later in bed she tells him Jamie said he was a hit at school and that the students think Burton can get them out of any crime they would commit
She adds that what the students do not know is that his brain is full of holes and that his hard drive is full
As she cuddles him Burton reaches for the documents on the nightstand
His eyes grow big as he reads it Back at the office Burton asks Brown why he didnt want a Silk to take the case
Brown says a Silk would just try to ram it through the court and that the client needs someone who would spend days elbows deep in the evidence
And because Burton wins The clerk comes by as Burton looks at the photographs in the file
He tells the clerk that he had never seen photographs like that and that the victim was alive for most of what happened
The clerk walks out without saying a word In the visiting room Burton narrates how the accused should say the body was found that he was walking a while with his dog through undergrowth not noticing that he was collecting blood on his shoes
He first thought he had stepped on the remains of an animal
The accused Mr Foyle posits it might have been a squirrel and then muses about how gray squirrels are killing red squirrels in their habitat and that the gray squirrels are then being killed by recently unseen black squirrels
Foyle concludes that you cant be too careful Brown tries to move the questioning forward and asks when Foyle usually does his laundry and then why after consistently doing so on Tuesdays he on the week in question went on a Monday
Burton prompts Foyle to say that it was because he ran out of clothes and not because he had blood on his shoes Burton mentions the large number of visits Foyle had to websites featuring extreme sadomasochism torture and necrophilia which are consistent with what happened to the victim
Foyle denies visiting these sites but Burton points to the credit card charges to these sites
Foyle says the credit cards are lying
Burton worries aloud that Foyles presentation style will not go over well with the jury
Foyle says what you see is what you get
Brown smirks that that is the problem
Foyle turns and glares at Brown and asks Burton if Brown has to be there Burton says yes Foyle thinks a while and asks Burton if hes picked up on the fact that he Foyle does not like people and is not a nice person and then wonders if Burton is behaving the way he is because he thinks he is guilty
Foyle demands that Brown leaves
Brown leaves
Foyle did not like being stared at
As they drink tea Foyle tells Burton that as they spend more time together the more Burton reminds him of himself Later Burton runs out of the courthouse bypassing Brown for some air
He stops at a shop for some cigarettes and sees a tabloid headline proclaiming Arrest Made in Ritual Slaying with a picture of the victim below At a fancy reception Gardners senior offers light hearted condolences for coming in second in the magazine ranking but she shrugs it off saying that it reminds her of coming in second to Burton on a school final
Burton with his wife looks as if he doesnt know what she is talking about Gardner admits it was a long time ago
Gardner notes that Burton will be up against her colleague Julian on the Foyle trial and they express surprise that she is not the prosecutor
She shrugs again and says she is thinking more of working the defense side
She thinks the case is a lost cause and wonders why Burton would seek to defend Foyle
She thinks he will get a lot of exposure but for the wrong reason
Burton says he doesnt do it for the exposure but because everyone deserves a defense Back home at Jamies birthday party Burton goes out to the balcony to take a call
Jamie brings him a piece of cake and asks who the call was from
Burton tells him it was a computer expert and Jamie jokingly asks if the expert will help back up Burtons hard drive
Later as Burton reads over the case the wife brings him a book on easy learning English conversation
He is only slightly amused
She then presents him with a card from the mail an invitation to his college reunion
He is only slightly amused Foyle does calisthenics in his cell before he is taken to the courthouse
Reporters swarm around the police van ignoring Burton who is walking past outside In the communal dressing room Julian notes that Gardner will be in the gallery
Julian points out that being number one results in everyone wanting to knock you down
He asks if Burton had petitioned the judge for an adjournment and Burton confesses saying that he needed more time In court Julian characterizes the case as being beyond description and defying community and humanity
A coroner a park employee and a banker testify to the heinous injuries sustained by the victim Sandra Mullins the observation that a man was seen rising from a lying position in the bushes and that the credit card transactions were made by Liam Foyle to companies that distribute depraved pornography respectively
From the dock Foyle yells liar to which the judge reprimands him as his only warning
Someone in the gallery yells murderer and Burton writes lynch mob on his pad and shows it to his assistant who nods Burton reminds the judge that he had submitted an application for an adjournment noting that in light of the testimony of the experts for the prosecution that he will need more time for his computer forensic specialist to prepare his counter arguments
The judge refuses saying that a fast trial is in the interest of the public and threatens Burton with contempt if he pursues it further The wife wakes in the middle of the night and finds Burton sitting at the end of Jamies bed
She urges him to go back to bed but hes thinking about installing locks on their windows
He says the world is broken
She thinks he shouldnt watch the news so close to bedtime In his holding cell Foyle tells Burton that he is not inspiring much confidence in the courtroom
Will says he knows what he is doing and that he is working at Foyles will
Foyle apologizes
Foyle confirms he only has the one computer In court Burton argues while SOMEbody had to pay for the murder of Sandra Mullins and Foyle is admittedly unlikeable that the testimony presented by the prosecution does not prove Foyle was involved in the murder
Burton calls the prosecutions computer expert to the stand and asks him why Foyle would pay for the s m websites but not actually visit them
He asks the expert if it is possible that upon visiting other porn websites that his identity was stolen and used by someone else to access the s m websites
Julian objects saying that the case is not about identity theft or porn websites to which Burton counters that in light of his inability to bring his own computer forensic specialist because of the lack of time he has to follow this line of questioning especially since the expert on the stand is the prosecutions own witness in camera Burton argues that his client has been falsely branded as a torturer pervert necrophiliac and that there is no way he can receive a fair trial now
The judge admits that he messed up
Back in court he dismisses the jury and releases Foyle
Outside Foyle offers a handshake Burton walks away At home Burton is still fussing with the dishwasher
The wife studying Italian in bed looks out the window and sees Jamie on the balcony waving at someone on the street below
By the time she gets out the man is gone As she is peeing the wife tries to reassure Burton who is fidgeting nervously at his reunion
The wife had been taking a pregnancy test
When Jamie comes by she tells him she has good news
Burton forgets his cell phone in the bathroom
After she reads Jamie a bedtime story the wife gets in the bath
A man is staring at her from the window Back at the reunion Burton finally realizes hes missing his phone and by the time he returns to the bathroom the wife has been calling repeatedly
He tells her to make sure everything is locked and to call the police
Burton finds the police searching the grounds
They find a party balloon with the words Sorry Youre Leaving on it At the office Burton is with Mayfield and a police detective who is eager but not very helpful
As Burton has never lost a case or ever refused to take on a client the police have nothing to go on Back home Burton installs motion sensor lights Back home Foyle feeds his birds including an owl while chanting Everybodys hungry At the office Burton asks the clerk if there has been a reply from the QC selection committee
The clerk suggests Burton wait on that
The partners tell Burton he has been named in complaints from Foyle about unprofessional conduct and dishonest behavior that Burton had expressed doubts in their conversations
Burton is incredulous as they WON the case
The partners recommend Burton delay his application for Silk
The partners call the clerk Danny to hold up the other lawyers before they leave for the day so they can strategize their next move Burton calls his wife to tell her he will be late
She urges him to hurry as she has something to show him
She and Jamie will meet him at the cottage
He loses her cell signal
Burton calls his wife but it goes to voicemail
It is dark when they unpack their car
Jamie goes in first and the wife Kate lags behind
When she goes in the cottage she calls for Jamie but he does not answer Burton makes it to the cottage
The car is left at the gate as Kate had it when she was unpacking the dog is walking around loose
The house is dark and nothing happens when Burton flips the light switch
He picks up a poker and a flashlight and yells for Kate and Jamie
He finds her in a back room lying in a pool of blood
He looks up and sees Foyle standing outside the window
Burton finds Jamie curled up in a fetal position trembling in the toy box
He finally gets a cell signal and calls for an ambulance The coroner takes Kates body away
Burton is huddled underneath blankets by the side of the gate Foyle is locked up in a jail cell After the funeral a senior barrister assures Burton that he is family and that things will be taken care of At home Burton sleeps with Jamie in his arms At a bar Burton and Danny make small talk until Danny tells him that Gardner is the defense counsel Burton goes to see Gardner outside her office
She is contrite but reminds him that quoting Burton himself everyone deserves a defense
Burton pulls an apple from his pocket and slams it into a finial in the fence Burton rushes to comfort Jamie who has had a bad dream Mayfield walks through the office calling for Trevor Harris
He tells him the case has been moved up
Harris asks if Mayfield knows for sure that Jamie did not see anything
Mayfield barks that the only things they have to work with are blood ID and alibi At home Burton is trying to convince a credit card representative that his wife does not wear aftershave nor is interested in Peter Rabbit collectibles
When the rep asks to talk to Kate Burton freaks and tosses his phone
Jamie has been watching this from the staircase
Burton apologizes and assures Jamie that he can talk to him about that night at any time In the visiting room Foyle prattles on about what happens to the animals in the forest when there is a heavy rain
Brown tries to get him back on track but then Foyle stares as Gardner pours tea leaves into a container of hot water
Brown says there is only one witness because Jamie has not made a statement yet
Brown says their effort will be focused on affirming Foyles alibi that he was with a Ms Morris
Foyle knows Burton cannot be part of the prosecution as he will be testifying as a witness and knows this because he had a law class at Cambridge
Foyle wonders if he may have crossed paths with Gardner and then expresses relief that Burton will not be working the case as he always beats Gardner
He says off the cuff that it was dark and then returns to talking about the animals in the rain At her office Gardners senior comes by and thinks she is working late because she has qualms
She says Burton lost his wife the senior counters that if the tables were turned Burton would not hesitate
He says she is not Burton at least not yet Burton is sitting outside the office in his car
Danny runs out and tells him that Mayfield is lead and Harris is assisting
Burton does not look pleased
Also forensics found a size 12 footprint outside the cottage Foyle is a size 9
His alibi is that he was having dinner with a neighbor Eileen Morris In a bar a private investigator shows Burton a printout from an internet news site when Morris presented Foyle with a Parish Council award for his birds
Burton thinks he has seen her name somewhere else Burton follows Morris from the Parish Council as she takes a box to a self storage building
Burton meets with Danny and tells him that Foyles alibi may not be solid
Burton asks where the Sandra Mullins case file is
He wonders if the box could wind up near his office As his officemates stare at him Burton goes to his office and goes through the case file
He finds what he is looking for and scurries out when an office mate approaches Danny stops Harris outside the office but Harris stops him when he tries to tell him something Foyle is again doing calisthenics when the guards come by to take him to court
Burton drops Jamie off at school Foyle pleads not guilty
Gardner asks that bail be granted due to lack of evidence and the judge agrees
Outside the court Foyle reaches into Gardners car to shake her hand
She does hesitantly and drives off
At a stop she sprays sanitizer on her hand At home Foyle pleasantly admonishes Morris who had been waiting for him on the sidewalk for bailing him out
She had been caring for his birds in his absence Burton strolls through the office as they are discussing the case
Mayfield intercepts him and they walk outside
Mayfield is surprised no one had told Burton about the plea or that Foyle posted bail
Burton runs off Jamie and a classmate walk out of a snack shop
Foyle who had been waiting follows them
Burton finds out from the school that Jamie had already left with his friend
He drives by the school but another classmate doesnt know where Jamie is
Foyle follows the two boys onto the bus and sits behind them
Burton makes it home but his mom has not heard from Jamie
The classmate gets off at his stop
Foyle moves to the seat across the aisle
Jamie looks over at Foyle
Jamie comes home and Burton makes him swear that he will not talk to anyone he doesnt know and that he will be picking Jamie up from school from now on Danny meets with Harris at a mall restaurant as Harris looks around nervously
Danny talks about football and how their team is missing their star striker
Harris reminds him that their star cannot play and cant even watch the match
Burton shows up and Harris freaks and then apologizes that another barrister wasnt chosen for the case its just that he was available
Harris calms down when Burton says he is the hardest working barrister at the firm Burton says that Foyle had mentioned he had a storage unit but gave it up six months before the murder
Someone else took it on after that Eileen Morris Burton leaves
Danny gets up to leave handing Harris a brief
He says that Spencer ___ will be on holiday shortly but he Danny hasnt decided where yet At home Jamie is blaring a video of Burton and Kates wedding
Burton puts it on mute and asks Jamie if he saw the man
Jamie says it was dark
He puts the sound back up Gardner is at home looking through the file when someone throws stones at her window
No one is there
She gets a call from Brown who says Foyle wants to meet with them immediately
Foyle doesnt show up at their office
Gardner suggests they go to Foyles house but Brown says they cant do that
She storms out Burton in bed with Jamie is listening to Kates outgoing message over and over
He tosses the phone On her way home Gardner sees a man running toward her and pulls out a can of mace
Its Burton
He is convinced Foyle murdered Kate and urges Gardner not to be alone
Outside her home a neighbor asks if her friend who was ringing her doorbell found her
She enters her home and walks in scared out of her mind

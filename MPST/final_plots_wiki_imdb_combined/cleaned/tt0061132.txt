Totò and his son Ninetto roam the neighbourhood and the countryside of Rome
During the walk they observe a body being removed from a house following a murder
They next encounter a talking crow who is described in the intertitles thus For the benefit of those who were not paying attention or are in doubt we remind you that the Crow is as you say a left wing intellectual of the kind found living before Palmiro Togliatti s death
The Crow subsequently recounts the tale of Fra Ciccillo and Fra Ninetto two Franciscan friars who are bid by St Francis to preach the Gospel to the hawks and the sparrows
After many months they succeeded in preaching the commandment of love unto the species separately but are not able to get them to love each other
The sparrow hawks continue to kill and eat the sparrows as it is in their nature
After the tale the journey of Totò and Ninetto carries on the Crow still accompanying them
They encounter other individuals land owners who order them out off their land when they are caught defecating a family living in absolute poverty with no food and who Totò threatens to drive out of the house if the rent is not paid a group of travelling actors and who persuade the pair to push the group s Cadillac car for them and a rich man who is waiting for Totò to give him the money he owes him
After that a brief extract of news footage of the funeral of Palmiro Togliatti the long time leader of the Italian Communist Party
Then after having met a prostitute they end up killing and eating the Crow whom they found to be unconscionably boring

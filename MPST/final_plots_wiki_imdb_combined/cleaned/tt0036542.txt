The cartoon begins with Mr Meek carrying an axe in his hands
He turns to the audience and explains that his wife Sweetypuss told him that if he didn t bring home a roast duck for dinner she would cook goose
The scene cuts to Daffy eating corn while singing I Dream of Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair minding his business
A shadow of Meek is show getting ready to chop off Daffy s head
Then he jumps and shout Watch it bub
directly in his face
After a brief talk to Meek he flicks his beak at his face and marches to a hay stack
Meek chops the stack various times and on the last chop he thinks he kills the duck
Daffy fakes his death by squirting ketchup and throwing his feathers around This fools Meek by pretending he is beheaded and runs rapidly
Meek feels sad and goes back to his house where Daffy is seen putting lots of sugar cubes into a cup of coffee
Meek guiltily tells him that he has killed a duck
Daffy cheers up Meek into giving him a cup of coffee and asks how many lumps his wife usually gives him
Meek shows Daffy a lump and Daffy hits him on the head and pours cream on it
Daffy dances on the cakes and pies singing Shortening Bread and Meek immediately recognizes the duck he thought he killed Daffy then utters YOU AIN T JUST WHISTLING DIXIE
then throws a pie at him leading into a war between himself and Meek
Daffy goes into army plane mode by dropping an egg on Meek as a Secret Bomb Site
Next he goes into battle weaponry mode by making various sounds and smashing household items
After all the fun and games are over Meek gets mad which causes the egg to fry on his head
Daffy runs off but is caught by Meek with a shotgun
He puts it up to Daffy s face and orders him to get in the oven
Daffy goes into his stripper mode and performs a striptease to the tune It Had to be You
The war continues through some parts of the cartoon including a fortune teller
Going back to the curve run scene Meek points his gun to Daffy s face again Meek blows the feathers off him and throws him in the oven
When he hears Daffy cries he fells guilty and opens the door
The cartoon ends with Daffy bathing himself in gravy

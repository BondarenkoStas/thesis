It is getting dark
John Brian Deacon and Harriet Ally Faulkner have not yet found a place to park their camper
They pass two mysterious women in the road and pull up beside a deserted castle where they intend to pass the night
For days they camp there not knowing that during the days the two women Fran Marianne Morris and Miriam Anulka lie asleep in the cemetery while at night they pick up men and take him to their castle
There they feed them wine have passionate sex and then stab them to death while drinking their blood
The only exception is Ted Murray Brown who manages to survive for three nights in a row
One evening Ted escapes
He runs to the camper to enlist John and Harriet s help
When John goes to start the car Fran and Miriam get him
When Harriet goes to check on John the girls get her
Ted apparently gets away

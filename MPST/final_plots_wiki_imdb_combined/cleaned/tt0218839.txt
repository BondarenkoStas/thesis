Best in Show is presented as a documentary of five dogs and their owners destined to show in the Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show held in Philadelphia
Segments of the documentary continuously cycle among owners and handlers as each prepares to leave for the show arrives at the hotel prepares backstage handles their dog s performance and appears in a post show follow up
The owners and their dogs include Gerry and Cookie Fleck with their Norwich Terrier Winky A middle class couple from Florida who run into monetary problems and are forced to sleep in the hotel s storage room when they finally arrive
Throughout the film they encounter men Cookie has slept with during her youth
Meg and Hamilton Swan with their Weimaraner Beatrice An upper class stereotypical yuppie couple from Chicago they think they are taking great care of Beatrice going as far as taking her to a therapist after she sees Meg and Hamilton have sex
At the show the Swans believe that Beatrice will become unnerved without her favorite toy the Busy Bee and frantically search for a replacement for it before the show
Harlan Pepper and his Bloodhound Hubert Harlan is the owner of a fishing goods store and prides himself on being able to name nuts
Pepper s family has raised a variety of hounds for generations and Harlan continues the tradition by raising bloodhounds
Sherri Ann and Leslie Ward Cabot with their Standard Poodle Rhapsody in White A two time past winner of the show
Sherri Ann is a trophy wife to the elderly Leslie her sugar daddy
They are assisted by trainer Christy Cummings who makes sure the dog is truly ready for the show while Sherri Ann fixates on giving Christy a makeover and Leslie remains utterly oblivious
Over the course of the film Sherri Ann and Leslie s sham marriage and Sherri Ann and Christy s romantic involvement becomes apparent
Scott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof and their Shih Tzu Miss Agnes A campy gay couple they take great pride in their dog and are confident that she will win the competition
They have a love of old movies and enjoy making fun of Christy Cummings but are friendly to the other competitors especially the Flecks
In fact when Winky wins Best in Show Scott is the first to walk up and congratulate Gerry
The owners and their dogs all arrive in time for the show which is hosted by dog expert Trevor Beckwith and oblivious color commentator Buck Laughlin
During the first round Beatrice is disqualified when Hamilton cannot control her but the other four dogs advance to the final round
Just before the finals Cookie dislocates her knee and insists that Gerry take over for her
Though the audience is initially awed by seeing Gerry s two left feet ultimately Winky takes Best in Show
Afterwards the film explores what each character is doing after the competition
Gerry and Cookie return home to Florida and are overcome with attention after the victory
They go on to record in amusingly bad style songs about terriers but discover to Gerry s frustration that the recording engineer is yet another of Cookie s ex boyfriends
Sherri Ann and Christy have entered into a partnership and publish a magazine for lesbian owners of purebred dogs called American Bitch
Harlan fulfills his dreams and becomes a ventriloquist entertaining sparse crowds with a honky tonk song and dance number
Stefan and Scott are in the process of designing a calendar featuring Shih Tzu dogs appearing in scenes with appropriate costume from famous classic films such as Gone with the Wind and Casablanca Hamilton and Meg Swan have given Beatrice away allowing them to enjoy a calmer more loving partnership as well as a new dog named Kipper that they claim enjoys watching them make love
The closing shot is of the Pug attempting to have sex with the therapist s leg

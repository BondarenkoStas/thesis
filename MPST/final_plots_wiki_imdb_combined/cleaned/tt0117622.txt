Major Richard Sharpe joins a combined naval and infantry expedition to the French coast with the intention of capturing a fortress and several chasse marées and inciting a monarchist rebellion in Bordeaux
The mission is intended primarily as a diversionary action to draw French forces from defense against a British crossing of the Adour River but Sharpe is unaware of this
The chassee marées are needed to construct a floating temporary bridge of the Adour and British intelligence holds out little expectation of an actual monarchist uprising
Sharpe is accompanied by naval Captain Horace Bampfylde and at the last moment is joined by the Comte de Maquerre ostensibly a member of the Chasseurs Britannique but in fact a spy for French intelligence
Bampfylde bungles the combined operation and wanders perilously close to an ambush set by American sailors under the command of Cornelius Killick
Sharpe intervenes decisively to capture the fortress and the American troops
Bampfylde later plans to hang all of the Americans as pirates but Sharpe again intervenes and after swearing Killick to an oath of future non aggression sets the Americans at liberty
Sharpe then marches inland toward Bordeaux while Bampfylde consolidates the landing position and writes official reports wherein he claims all of the successes as his own
Sharpe prosecutes a successful raid on a supply and reinforcement column and then retreats back toward the fortress
He is met by de Maquerre who claims Bordeaux has risen in open rebellion de Maquerre then travels to the fortress and informs Bampfylde that Sharpe s contingent has been destroyed to the man and that a vast French force is moving rapidly toward the fortress
The cowardly Bampfylde strips the fortress of supplies spikes the guns and detonates the main arsenal seriously damaging the fortress defensive capabilities
He then sails home leaving Sharpe abandoned and without supplies
Hours later an astounded Sharpe falls back to the ruined fortress and improves his position
Meanwhile French intelligence agent Major Pierre Ducos joins with General Calvet and a large French force to lay siege to the fortress
Sharpe s men fight against impossible odds but manage to hold off several assault waves
Ducos orders Killick to break his oath and participate in the siege against Sharpe
Sharpe then travels secretly by night and meets with Killick to arrange for a contrived surrender
In exchange for being released from the non aggression oath Killick agrees with Sharpe s proposal
The next morning Killick s ship makes a minor preparatory bombardment of the coastal fortress prior to the French assault whereupon Sharpe surrenders to the American privateer
While confusion runs through the French forces Sharpe s men rapidly board the American privateer
The last boats leave the beach as an enraged Ducos orders a technically illegal assault on the ostensibly American held fortress
Killick lands Sharpe close to British lines and Sharpe leads his men to safety
He then makes a final report in the process insulting Bampfylde and killing the traitorous de Maquerre upon the newly completed floating bridge

The film is composed of two narrative threads
One follows the large team of experimental physicists at CERN as they try to get the LHC running properly
After a promising initial test run the LHC suffers a liquid helium leak in 2007 that damages its electromagnets
Fabiola Gianotti Martin Aleksa and Monica Dunford are all shown discussing how to handle the negative publicity surrounding the accident and how to proceed
After repairs in 2009 the LHC begins to run experiments again at half power
The other thread follows the competing theories of Nima Arkani Hamed and his mentor Savas Dimopoulos
In the film Arkani Hamed advocates for the multiverse theory which predicts the mass of the Higgs boson to be approximately 140 giga electronvolts
Dimopoulos argues for the more established supersymmetry theory which predicts the mass of the Higgs boson to be approximately 115 GeV
The narrative threads combine at the end of the film when CERN announces the confirmed existence of a Higgs like particle with a mass of approximately 125 GeV
The discovery of the particle is met with a standing ovation and Peter Higgs is shown wiping away tears
However neither of the competing theories of the universe is definitively supported by the finding
Later Kaplan is shown admitting that none of his theoretical models are supported by this finding and that the long term implications of the discovery are unclear

Princess Caroline Matilda of Great Britain is shown writing a letter to her children in which she professes to tell them the truth
In flashback Caroline talks of England as she was about to leave to marry Christian VII of Denmark
She is passionate about the arts and education but when she arrives in Denmark she is told that many of her books are banned by the state
Christian is mentally ill and Caroline is unhappy in the marriage
She is soon pregnant with a son but the couple grow far apart and the king stops visiting her bedroom
The German doctor Johann Friedrich Struensee is recruited to work as the king s personal physician
Struensee is a man of the Enlightenment greatly influenced by the writings of Jean Jacques Rousseau
He keeps this secret from the state who welcome him because his father is a well known priest
King Christian takes a strong liking to Struensee and he becomes a close friend and confidant
When Struensee manages to inoculate Prince Frederick against a smallpox epidemic he becomes greatly respected in the court
Christian has very little influence in the Privy Council and the laws of the country are mostly decided by statesmen but Struensee tells the king that he can have more power by acting
The doctor begins writing speeches for the king which advocate his own progressive views and several reforms are passed in Denmark
Caroline and Struensee learn of their mutual interests and liberal views
They fall in love and begin an affair
When Caroline becomes pregnant they protect themselves by convincing Christian to resume sleeping with her
As a result Princess Louise Auguste is believed to be the king s daughter
Meanwhile Struensee is appointed a Royal Adviser and eventually persuades Christian to assign him the right to pass any law making him Denmark s de facto leader
His reforms include the abolition of censorship the abolition of torture and reducing the power of the aristocracy
The queen dowager Juliana Maria of Brunswick Wolfenbüttel notices the romance between Caroline and Struensee and their affair is revealed
Christian is initially angry but he forgives his friend and states that they must carry on as if nothing had changed
Juliana and the prominent statesman Ove Høegh Guldberg are strongly against Struensee s reforms while the Danish people also grow unhappy when it becomes clear an immoral foreigner has power over the country
Høegh Guldberg incites a coup against him
Christian refuses to hand Struensee over to the people but Høegh Guldberg lies that the doctor and Caroline are planning to murder him and take control of Denmark
Christian thus allows Caroline to be arrested and taken to live in exile while Struensee is sentenced to death
Christian issues a pardon not wanting his friend to die but Høegh Guldberg keeps this from materialising in time and Struensee is beheaded
Høegh Guldberg becomes Denmark s new de facto leader and many of Struensee s reforms are overturned
The film returns to Caroline writing the letter where she reveals that she is dying of an illness
Ten years later Prince Frederick and Princess Louise Auguste read the letter
On screen text reveals that when he became king Frederick returned to the reforming ways of Struensee

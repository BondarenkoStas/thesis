The film starts with a showing of the 1958 award winning cartoon Knighty Knight Bugs before going into its opening credits
This is followed up by Bugs narrating how Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies immediately replaced baggy pants comedy before introducing us to a warm hearted humble little Introvert called Yosemite Sam
Act 1 Satan s Waitin Yosemite Sam courts Granny with evil intentions for the 50 000 000 she has inherited but Bugs overhears his scheming and thwarts Sam under the guise of another suitor and later Granny herself
In the end Sam dies after being crushed by a safe that Bugs drops on him and lands in Hell
Satan offers to give Sam another chance in life provided he sends someone in his place
Sam agrees to this and as a Roman guard captain a Saudi Arabian and in his usual cowboy guise attempts to kill Bugs
His attempts are unsuccessful but when Satan keeps offering him one more chance Sam refuses stating Satan should get the rabbit himself and decides to stay
Act 2 The Unmentionables Bugs Bunny explains about cops and robbers as well as Gangster films
In Act 2 there will be three cartoons dedicated to the gangster character Rocky
Immediately after becoming a police detective Bugs is captured by Rocky and his gang who try to drown him
Bugs promptly escapes that and then infiltrates Rocky s birthday party that night disguised as a showgirl
Rocky soon sees through Bugs disguise and accompanied by Mugsy chases him into a cereal factory where Bugs traps the pair on the cereal manufacturing machine
Afterwards he brings Rocky to court but thanks to some manipulations and obfuscating legalese by Rocky s sleazy and unethical lawyer at his trial the mobster is free to go
Bugs has problems finding Rocky s new hideout until word breaks out of farmer Porky Pig s golden egg which was apparently laid by Daffy Duck
Upon reading of this news Rocky and his men capture Daffy and demand him to lay a golden egg
He eventually does after Rocky shoots him in the head and is then ordered to lay more to fill up their collection of egg cartons
Bugs and the police suddenly bust in and arrest Rocky s troop
But another law loophole sets Rocky free again
Rocky then captures Tweety Bird and holds him for ransom and Bugs appoints Sylvester to find Tweety and pins a badge on his chest leaving him yelping in pain
Sure enough the pussycat finds Tweety in Rocky s hideout
After several failed attempts by Sylvester to get Tweety out of here the police show up and surround Rocky s hideout
Sylvester ends up being hailed as a hero for having seemingly rescued Tweety and Bugs brings Rocky to justice but is forced to go to jail with him and Mugsy because he lost the keys to his handcuffs
Act 3 The Oswalds In the third and final act Bugs introduces us to the Oswald Awards an award ceremony created by Friz for cartoon characters
He then hosts the ceremony himself announcing the nominees the Wolf from Three Little Bops Sylvester Tweety and himself
During Bugs show Daffy talks to an impressed Yosemite Sam who then yells at him to shut up which sends Daffy right into Granny s arms who glares at an angry Sam
After Sylvester and Tweety s show Clarence devours Tweety and Sylvester and Granny both grab Tweety back from him
During all this Daffy Duck continually gripes about the fact that he has not been nominated
When Bugs wins the award Daffy becomes furious and challenges Bugs to a talent showdown
Bugs seems to have the audience s favor but Daffy eventually wins their applause by blowing himself up
Bugs gives the now ghostly Daffy the award with the duck responding It just goes to show you you gotta kill yourself to win an Oswald in this town
That s all Folks
There was no outro send off for this movie because after the third and final act Bugs Bunny at first does the That s all Folks
send off but then Porky tells Bugs that it was his line
Bugs then allows Porky to do the send off but sadly before he could do the chance the Iris Door was used in the opening credits of the movie instantly closes on him Porky just grumbles and says D D Dirty Guys as the film fades out

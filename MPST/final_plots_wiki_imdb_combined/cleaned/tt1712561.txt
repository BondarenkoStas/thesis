Setting The Forgotten Sands returns to the storyline established by Prince of Persia The Sands of Time and concluded by Prince of Persia The Two Thrones
On December 14 2009 Ubisoft UK released the first details of the story on their official video portal
The game takes place in the seven year gap between Prince of Persia The Sands of Time and Prince of Persia Warrior Within
The Prince character is supposed to be a cross between the character models in these two games
He is again voiced by Yuri Lowenthal
Plot Note This plot is the one found in the PS3 Xbox 360 and PC versions of the game
The Prince is riding through a desert on his horse on a quest to see his brother Malik and learn about leadership from him
When the Prince arrives at Malik s kingdom he finds it under attack by an army which is attempting to breach the treasure vaults for a great power known as Solomon s Army
The Prince charges in to the city and tracks Malik to the treasure vaults
Here Malik says that he is fighting a losing battle and proposes to rely on a last resort or be forced to retreat
The Prince strongly objects but Malik releases Solomon s Army using a magical seal
Solomon s Army is an assortment of different creatures all made of sand
The Prince and Malik both manage to obtain halves of the seal used to keep the army contained protecting them from being turned into sand statues which is the fate of the rest of the kingdom
Malik is separated from the Prince who finds a portal to the domain of Razia a Djinn of the Marid race
Razia tells the Prince that the only way to re imprison Solomon s Army is to reunite both halves of the seal
Razia gives the Prince special powers and sends him to find Malik and the other half of the seal
When the Prince finds Malik he is not interested in stopping Solomon s Army but instead wants to destroy it and use its power to become a more powerful leader
This is explained by Razia whereas the Prince is using the power gifted to him by Razia Malik is using power taken directly from those he defeats
The Army s sand is gradually affecting his mind making him susceptible to Ratash s influence
The Prince again sets out to find Malik but this time to forcibly take his half of the seal
When he finds him Malik is stronger and manages to escape
Pursuing Malik again the Prince finds Ratash Ifrit leader of the Army searching for the seal
After the Prince outruns him he concludes Ratash must now be chasing Malik and so sets out to aid him
The Prince arrives in the throne room to find Malik and Ratash fighting and he aids Malik
The Prince and Malik seem to kill Ratash and Malik absorbs his power shattering his half of the seal
Malik then runs off seemingly in a hysterical fit using some of Ratash s powers to escape
The Prince pursues him and again finds Razia
Razia explains that Ratash cannot be killed by any ordinary sword and that what actually happened was quite different from what the Prince saw Ratash has actually killed Malik and possessed his body
The Prince doesn t believe this and sets out to find the Djinn Sword hidden in the ancient city of Rekem which Razia says can kill Ratash
Along the way the Prince chases Malik now being used by Ratash to retake the Ifrit s original form
The Prince loses a battle to Ratash and convinced his brother is truly dead finds the Djinn Sword
Razia soon bonds with the sword giving it the power needed to destroy Ratash
The Prince again searches for Ratash
When he finds him Ratash is now gigantic literally fed by the sandstorm which has come over the palace
The Prince uses the sword to kill Ratash and when the sandstorm subsides he finds Malik dying
Malik says to tell their father that Prince will be as mighty a leader as Solomon then dies
In an epilogue the Prince tells of how he took the sword back to Rekem where he thought Razia would want to rest and how he must now set out to inform his father of Malik s death

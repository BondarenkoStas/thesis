During a formal dinner party at the lavish mansion of Señor Edmundo Nóbile and his wife Lucia the servants unaccountably leave their posts until only the major domo is left
After dinner the guests adjourn to the music room where one of the women Blanca plays a piano sonata
Later when they might normally be expected to return home the guests curiously remove their jackets loosen their gowns and settle down for the night on couches chairs and the floor
By morning it is apparent that for some inexplicable reason they are unable to leave
The guests consume what little drinks and food are left from the previous night s party
Days pass and their plight intensifies they become thirsty hungry quarrelsome hostile and hysterical only Dr Carlos Conde applying logic and reason manages to keep his cool and guide the guests through the ordeal
One of the guests the elderly Sergio Russell dies and his body is placed in a large cupboard
Much later in the film Béatriz and Eduardo a young couple about to be married lock themselves in a closet and commit suicide
The guests eventually manage to break open a wall enough to access a water pipe
In the end several sheep and a bear break loose from their bonds and find their way to the room the guests take in the sheep and proceed to slaughter and roast them on fires made from floorboards and broken furniture
Dr Conde reveals to Nóbile that one of his patients Leonora is dying from cancer and accepts a secret supply of morphine from the host to keep her pain under control
The supply of drugs is however stolen by Francis and Juana a brother and sister
Ana a Jew and a practitioner of Kabbalah tries to free the guests by performing a mystical ceremony which fails
Eventually Raúl suggests that Nóbile is responsible for their predicament and that he must be sacrificed
Only Dr Conde and the noble Colonel Alvaro oppose the angry mob claiming Nóbile s blood
As Nóbile offers to take his own life a young foreign guest Leticia sees that they are all seated in the same positions as when their plight began
Upon her encouragement the group starts reconstructing their conversation and movements from the night of the party and discover that they are then free to leave the room
Outside the manor the guests are greeted by the local police and the servants who had left the house on the night of the party and who had similarly found themselves unable to enter it
To give thanks for their salvation the guests attend a Te Deum at the cathedral
When the service is over the churchgoers along with the clergy are also trapped
It is not entirely clear though whether those that were trapped in the house before are now trapped again
They seem to have disappeared
The situation in the church is followed by a riot on the streets and the military step in to brutally clamp down firing on the rioters
The last scene shows a flock of sheep entering the church in single file accompanied by the sound of gunshots

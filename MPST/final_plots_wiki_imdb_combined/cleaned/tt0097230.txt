The film situated in Hollywood or Tinsel Town as the narrator calls it opens with Hollywood House of Wax owner Raymond Everett receiving a delivery of some valuable antiques from Poenari Romania
He anxiously takes delivery of a sixth crate even though he was only expecting five
Later that evening at a Jazz bar called The Blue Angel a sleazy but lonely patron hits on a mysterious dark haired woman who wonders in
Soon after they leave together and travel to a secluded park where this peculiar woman kills the man
More shenanigans ensue that night when over at the wax museum two thieves break in while Raymond is upstairs watching Nosferatu
During the robbery a creature with webbed hands and dagger like nails attacks one of the thieves
The thief s throat is ripped open and his blood drained by a long tentacle emitted from the creature s mouth
The other man escapes
Following this attack the mysterious brunette from earlier enters the room where Raymond sits unsuspecting
After a very short battle of wills Raymond is taken possession of and forced to renounce his girlfriend Jenny Harker
The next day Lt Lannon and his partner Citrano are called to the crime scene at the park
A clue left in the grass leads them to The Blue Angel in which witnesses are unable to contribute much
Meanwhile Raymond tries to free himself from the Vampire s hold but fails instead he cleans up her mess before Jenny arrives
Raymond s girlfriend who also works at the museum observes his distress
She tries to comfort him but instead Raymond tries to bite her unsuccessfully
As night falls the creature attacks again
This time it is a night watchman who is ironically watching a news report about the park murder at the onset of his death
Summoned by the vampire Raymond picks her up in his car
She tells him that he must return her to Romania to her husband Count Dracula
However Raymond informs her of Count Dracula s death and that van Helsing is responsible
At this moment Raymond s girlfriend Jenny glimpses him in the car with the other woman
The police receive a valuable part of the puzzle from the frazzled burglar who witnessed his accomplice s death at the wax museum the previous night
Later through van Helsing s aged grandson we learn that all vampires were destroyed with the exception of Vanessa who is the true wife of Dracula
She is described as both beauty and beast
In a sleazier part of town Vanessa and Raymond encounter a group of hardcore occultists who seem to sense Vanessa s evilness and welcome her
She surprises them though when she transforms into the beast and slaughters all save Raymond
The next morning Jenny angrily confronts Raymond over the phone and then abruptly hangs up
Distressed Raymond writes a letter confessing his predicament hoping she will forgive him
Back at the wax museum Raymond is met by Lt Lannon who casually searches the premises
The lieutenant confronts Raymond with the burglar s admission which he denies
However their meeting is cut short when Lannon is called to another of Vanessa s massacres
There Lannon meets van Helsing s elderly grandson who tells him that vampires not devil worshippers are to blame
To establish his theory they journey to the morgue where Vanessa s first victim is located
With a wooden stake and mallet Helsing makes Lannon a believer as the victim is briefly reanimated at the moment of his true death
Later Lannon visits Jenny hoping to discover more information about Raymond and gain her trust
Jenny afterwards meets up with Raymond and he gives her a cross to protect her
Night arrives and more murders follow as Vanessa slays Citrano and Helsing
Consequentially Raymond is arrested and his wax museum searched for evidence which police discover

However the only cop who believes him is Lt Lannon
He and Jenny eventually collaborate to locate Vanessa and exonerate Raymond
As night approaches Raymond is taken to a vacant warehouse by a few officers for a bit of police brutality but Vanessa intervenes hoping to eliminate Raymond herself
Jenny via supernatural intervention discovers the warehouse
Both she and Lannon are able to distract Vanessa while Raymond takes the opportunity to kill her thus regaining his humanity

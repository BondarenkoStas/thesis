Two young women travel by car through the Auvergne
Having run out of gas near an odd village they spend the night in a barn where they make love
The next morning Anna is gone and a dwarf in medieval garb guides Françoise through a forest to a lake where a magic canoe carries her to an island and then to a castle where scantily clad women frolic and kiss overseen by the dwarf Gurth
Françoise is interviewed by Morgan le Fay and bathed by some of her women
Gurth reveals in a monologue that he procures the women for Morgan and has aspirations to take over
During dinner Morgan and Françoise discuss love and beauty and Morgan reveals that time is at her command
Afterward she proceeds to caress and kiss Françoise while her women wonder if they ve been forgotten
Morgan offers immortality and beauty if the offer is not accepted a life of abjection among a group of older women is the victim s lot
Anna tied up in the basement accepts the offer but Françoise escapes to look for the boat
She manages to swim across only to find Morgan waiting for her on the other side wherever she turns she takes her back to her castle and promises to teach her magic
Françoise however schemes with Gurth to escape and a feast the next day appears to be a good occasion to get a magic necklace and other items together
Dances are performed and groups of women engage in various kinds of lovemaking Françoise makes love to the woman who has the magic tunic and runs off with it
The necklace has also been stolen
Françoise now in the tunic which renders her invisible and wearing the necklace needs only Morgan s topaz globe without which she can t leave the forest
Gurth is accused and sentenced to blindness muteness and leglessness
He gives Françoise his ring of life so he will die and she will be able to escape he dies instantly and Françoise escapes from the castle and boards the boat
Gurth s horse appears and Françoise rides off ending up in the village just in time for a funeral procession
However she calls out for Morgan who is there immediately
Morgan takes her back to the barn where Anna is sleeping still with Françoise being watched now by Françoise

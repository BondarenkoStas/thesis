Two police detectives in Lyon both single and childless are investigating the murder of a young man called Vince whose body is found strangled in the river Rh√¥ne
It emerges that Vince was a high end male prostitute finding clients on the internet and meeting them in hotels
His girlfriend was a student Reb who he recruited to join him in threesomes so increasing his range of clients and his earnings
One encounter went wrong when the client started to get rough with Reb upon which Vince beat him up and the two fled
Furious at the way Reb had been treated Vince decided to blackmail the man and arranged a rendezvous on the top floor of a multi storey car park
After handing over the money the client then attacked Vince with a golf club upon which Reb waded in with her motorbike helmet
Her blows killed the man so the two hid his body in his car and fled
Vince s pimp then met him to claim his share of Vince s takings and a fight developed in which the pimp strangled Vince and then dumped his body in the river
The detectives charge the pimp with murder but not Reb

Dark Souls has a minimalistic plot
Historical events in this world and their significance are often implicit and left to player interpretation rather than fully shown or explained
Most of the story is given to the player through dialogue from characters within the game flavor text from items and world design
The opening cutscene establishes the premise of the game
The world was once shrouded by grey fog and ruled by dragons
In this time period Gwyn happens upon the First Flame and finds a Lord Soul
He and his allies use their power to defeat the dragons beginning the Age of Fire
Over time the flames begin to fade and Gwyn sacrifices himself and his soul to prolong the Age of Fire
With the flame dwindling the undead curse arises causing certain humans to continually resurrect upon death
The player character is a cursed undead locked away in an undead asylum
After escaping the asylum the player travels to Lordran to ring the Bells of Awakening
The bells awaken Kingseeker Frampt who tells the player to ascend to Anor Londo
In Anor Londo Gwynevere instructs the player to succeed Lord Gwyn and fulfill the prophecy
To accomplish this the Lord Souls must be acquired from Gwyn s primordial allies and returned to the flame
The player may encounter Darkstalker Kaathe who encourages the player not to link the fire but to let it die out and usher in the Age of Dark
Once the player acquires the Lord Souls they travel to the Kiln of the First Flame to succeed Lord Gwyn
Once Gwyn has been defeated the player is given the choice of linking the flame to preserve the Age of Fire or letting it die out to instigate the Age of Dark

After three hippie drug dealers are murdered by the assassin in a house in Los Angeles the U S government sends special agent Paul Sherman to track down the Dutch source of heroin that is causing the drug war
On arriving at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport Sherman witnesses an agent Jimmy Duclos who was there to meet him shot dead by the assassin
Sherman is originally from the Netherlands but it is clear that Amsterdam s chief of police Colonel De Graaf is unhappy with having the Americans interfere in Dutch affairs
However Sherman s direct contact Inspector Van Gelder is more cooperative since his niece Trudi suffers from severe brain damage caused by a heroin overdose eight years earlier
Sherman makes contact with a deep cover agent from Washington named Maggie
Sherman is then followed around Amsterdam by the assassin indicating that the drug dealers have someone on the inside
Sherman gets away from him and later tracks him down in a hotel room where Sherman kills him
Sherman meets Duclos girlfriend Astrid Lemay and her drug addicted brother George
Soon after George dies of an overdose and she is murdered
Sherman is attacked by a man on a boat and shoots him dead
Drug lord Meegeren who had killed Astrid then kills Maggie and holds Sherman prisoner
Meegeren leaves on a speedboat
Sherman escapes and follows him on another speedboat
The chase ends with Meegeren accidentally crashing his boat and it being destroyed by fire
Sherman and a colleague arrive at a warehouse where the drugs are being distributed
There he meets Van Gelder and his niece
He finds out that they are part of the trafficking gang and that Trudi had been faking her mental disability
A shootout leaves Trudi dead and Sherman wounded
Van Gelder tries to escape but is killed by Sherman

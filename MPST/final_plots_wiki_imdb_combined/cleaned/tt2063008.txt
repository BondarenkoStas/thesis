A father and his young son journey across post apocalyptic America some years after an extinction event
Their names are never revealed in the story
The land is covered with ash and devoid of life
The boy s mother pregnant with him at the time of the disaster committed suicide shortly after giving birth
Realizing they cannot survive the winter the man takes the boy south along empty roads towards the sea carrying their meager possessions in their knapsacks and a supermarket cart
The man is suffering from a serious cough and knows he is dying
He assures his son that they are good guys who are carrying the fire
The pair have a revolver but only two rounds
The father has taught the boy to use the gun on himself if necessary to avoid falling into the hands of cannibals
The father uses one of the rounds to kill a marauder who discovers them disturbing the boy
They flee the marauder s companions abandoning most of their possessions
When they search a house for supplies they discover a locked cellar containing captives whom cannibal gangs have been eating limb by limb and flee into the woods
As they are near starvation the pair discover a concealed bunker filled with food clothes and other supplies
They stay there for several days regaining their strength and then move on taking lots of supplies from the bunker with them
They encounter an elderly man with whom the boy insists they share food
Further along the road they evade a group whose members include a pregnant woman and soon after they discover a newborn infant roasted on a spit
They come to a house where they find more food and a wheelbarrow they use to carry their supplies but the man s condition is worsening
The pair reaches the beach where they see a boat drifting out at sea
The man swims to it and recovers supplies including a flare gun which he demonstrates to the boy
After their wheelbarrow is stolen they desperately look for it and those who took it
After finding a single man with the wheelbarrow the father forces him to strip naked
After this distresses the boy he leaves the clothes on the road with a can of food in hopes the man will find it
In a town inland the man is shot in the leg with an arrow by a husband and wife
After the man kills the husband with the flare gun the pair move further south along the beach
The man loses a lot of blood and after several days realizes he will soon die
He tells the boy he can talk to him in prayer after he is gone and that he must continue without him
After he dies the boy stays with his body for three days
He is finally approached by a man carrying a shotgun who has a wife and two children a boy and a girl
He convinces the boy he is one of the good guys and after helping the boy bury his father on the beach takes him under his protection

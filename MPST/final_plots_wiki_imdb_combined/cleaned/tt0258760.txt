Kai and Stefan are two friends who own a gourmet pizza delivery business as a front for selling cannabis
Stefan is finishing law school and preparing to take the Bar examination to become a lawyer under the behest of his father who is a judge
They visit their outdoor cannabis growing operation only to discover that aphids are destroying their plants
They visit a head shop and meet Achim who informs them that he knows how to get rid of aphids handing them a tub full of Aphidoletes aphidimyza
However unbeknownst to the protagonists Achim is an undercover police officer
After much debate the duo decide to bring Achim to the plantation so that he can help with the aphid problem using an adulterant on the plants called Brain cell massacre which according to Achim is used in Kazakhstan plantations
On the way to the growing area they try to pick psychedelic mushrooms convinced that nobody will be suspicious of mushrooms on a pizza
They test them out on Achim while he is at the plantation stating that they already tried some
Achim is poisoned by the mushrooms and goes into a convulsive state when suddenly a hunter is spotted nearby
The Brain cell massacre is used to knock Achim out and he is locked in the protagonists trunk along with the hunter who discovered the cannabis plantation as well as the harvested crop itself
After narrowly avoiding an unrelated police search the duo confront Stefan s father and confess their situation
Though Stefan s father becomes upset he calls the chief of police whom he befriended when he was a public prosecutor
With the help of the chief of police the duo get off the hook and Stefan takes his bar exam only to walk out at the last minute to pursue his lifelong dream of owning a cafe on a beach

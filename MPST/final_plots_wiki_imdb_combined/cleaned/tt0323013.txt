Karan Shergill is a young man from Delhi who has no goal or for his future
His father is a businessman and his brother is a successful individual living in America
His girlfriend Romila Dutta Romi a student activist and reporter who espouses fashionable causes out of well meaning sincerity tells him he needs to find a goal in life
When a friend announces he is going to join the Indian Army Karan applies to the Indian Military Academy as well despite dissent from his parents
Karan gets selected into the IMA although his friend backs out
However he is undisciplined and unused to life there
He keeps receiving punishments from the training team
Upset he runs away from the academy which causes Romi to break up with him
Karan finally comes to terms with his situation and makes his decision
He returns to the IMA takes his punishment becomes a focused disciplined officer cadet and eventually commissions into the Indian Army
Karan is posted to the 3rd battalion of the Punjab Regiment commanded by Col Sunil Damle
The battalion is stationed in Kargil Jammu and Kashmir
Karan comes home on leave and finds out that Romi is getting engaged but is recalled to his battalion due to an outbreak of hostilities in Kargil and his leave is cut short
He reports back to his battalion where he is promoted to the rank of acting Captain
His battalion CO briefs the officers on the latest situation
He reveals that a number of infiltrators have crossed the Line of Control from Pakistan and currently occupy a series of mountain peaks on the Indian side of the border
The battalion has been assigned to secure Point 5179 a crucial vantage point dominating the army s main supply line the National Highway 1D
The northern side of the mountain is on the Pakistani side of the LoC the western side has a 1000 foot vertical rock cliff and the southern side has 3 km of empty ground with no cover
Therefore the battalion decides to attack from the eastern side of the mountain
The first part of the assault is successful
The battalion destroys the enemy s screening units with Karan cited for his bravery in saving another officer s life
Meanwhile Romi gets stationed to Kargil as a war correspondent where she meets a changed Karan
Romi breaks off her engagement and tries to renew her relationship with Karan amidst the war
In the second phase of the assault the battalion attacks the peak of the mountain but fails to capture it due to the strategic advantage and heavy weaponry the Pakistanis have
The unit suffers heavy casualties
Brigadier Puri summons Col Damle and gives him 48 hours to capture the peak after that time period responsibility for Point 5179 will be given to another battalion
Col Damle then orders a group of 12 officers and soldiers to scale the 1000 foot rock cliff on the western side of the mountain and flank the enemy stronghold
They will be provided with artillery support from the eastern side
Karan realises that he has finally found his goal in the form of capturing the peak
The unit sets off on their mission and while moving through a grass field toward the rock cliff they come under fire
The unit discovers a Pakistani mortar unit in the field and destroys it but loses their commanding officer and a number of other soldiers
The team s radios are also destroyed so they cannot communicate with battalion HQ
Out of the initial 12 only 6 remain
They decide to continue with the mission
They successfully scale the cliff and attack the Pakistani position during the night
Their assault is successful although Karan is wounded and the team loses 3 more men
The next morning Karan limps to the peak where he plants the Indian flag and fires a flare signalling to Col Damle that they captured the peak
The film ends with Karan leaving a military hospital and reuniting with his parents and Romi

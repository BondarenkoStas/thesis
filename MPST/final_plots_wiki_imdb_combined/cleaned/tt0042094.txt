The program evolved from NBC s first TV variety showcase Four Star Revue sponsored by Motorola
The running gag sketches were dropped in favor of more performing acts
The weekly show was proposed to be hosted by four comedians in a four week rotation to provide competition for Ed Sullivan s Toast of the Town on CBS
The first episode starring Hans Conried Rosemary DeCamp and Dick Foran was written and produced by the then 22 year old Peggy Webber who appeared in over 100 episodes of Dragnet with Jack Webb
The new format was heavily backed by its sponsor Colgate Palmolive to the tune of 3 million in the first year and the 8 00 p m
ET Sunday evening format show was a spectacular success particularly for Eddie Cantor and the Martin Lewis and Abbott Costello duos
In his autobiography Jerry Lewis wrote that the show premiered Sunday September 17 1950 with Martin Lewis and was telecast from the Park Theatre off Columbus Circle in New York City
As theatres are known by different names over history it is possible that this was the now demolished International Theatre at 5 Columbus Circle the broadcast location of another NBC show of the era Your Show of Shows with Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca
In fact Eddie Cantor hosted the first Colgate Hour on September 10 1950
During the 1950 51 season AT T put into regular service a coast to coast coaxial microwave interconnection service which allowed live telecasts from across the nation
Three production units were quickly set up one in New York one in Chicago and one in Los Angeles
Martin Lewis and Abbott Costello anchored the West Coast broadcasting from the El Capitan theater in Hollywood while Eddie Cantor anchored from New York
This gave NBC a substantial edge over Ed Sullivan since top grade talent from motion pictures could also do network TV on the West Coast Colgate Comedy Hour while Sullivan had to work with whomever happened to be in New York at the time that a particular episode aired
During the 1952 53 season Cantor suffered a heart attack immediately after a Colgate Comedy Hour broadcast in September
Although he quickly recovered and returned in January 1953 he was reluctant to move with the show
By the fourth season the sponsor was providing 6 million but the performers were finding difficulty in offering fresh material
Ratings hence began to decline
Cantor had become too ill to continue in the hosting role and the travel was too stressful and painful for him
His final Colgate appearance was in May 1954
Vic Schoen was hired as the musical director in 1954
In 1954 Tony Martinez later cast as the farmhand on The Real McCoys made his television debut on The Colgate Comedy Hour
Hal March and Tom D Andrea appeared on The Colgate Comedy Hour in what subsequently became in the summer of 1955 the 11 episode NBC live military comedy series The Soldiers
D Andrea took leave from his role as Jim Gillis in William Bendix s The Life of Riley for The Soldiers
In June 1955 the show changed its name to the Colgate Variety Hour to reflect a move away from pure comedy
A number of the earlier hosts had left by the end of the 1953 54 season as the show shifted toward mini musicals starring hosts such as Ethel Merman and Frank Sinatra who paired together in truncated version of Cole Porter s Anything Goes
The show was also performing on the road as well unlike other seasons where the shows were transmitted from New York or Los Angeles at 8 p m Gordon MacRae often served as host during this period
However ratings continued to slide while The Ed Sullivan Show got stronger
The final show emceed by the series last continuing host Robert Paige aired as a Christmas special on December 25 1955 with Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians choral ensemble
The Colgate Comedy Hour was replaced the following season with the NBC Comedy Hour hosted by Leo Durocher for the first three shows
After Durocher the regular hosts changed and after 18 broadcasts the final show aired in June
Regular supporting casts always co starred in each of the episodes
Jonathan Winters was featured on the show
On November 5 1967 NBC broadcast a special Colgate Comedy Hour revival with guests Nanette Fabray Kaye Ballard Edie Adams Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks performing one of their 2000 Year Old Man routines Phyllis Diller Bob Newhart Nipsey Russell and Dan Rowan Dick Martin
None of the performers who had performed in the original 1950 1956 shows appeared
The special also served as a television pilot for a possible revival of the series which never happened
In the 1954 1955 season Donald O Connor left the show and starred in his own musical situation comedy The Donald O Connor Show which aired on the NBC Saturday schedule alternating with The Jimmy Durante Show
Notable guest stars who went on to find success in entertainment included Vera Miles costar of Alfred Hitchcock s thriller Psycho Bob Fosse later a noted choreographer and director who won multiple Tonys and an Academy Award for his work and even a child age Christopher Walken who became an Oscar winning actor and screen star appeared alongside Jerry Lewis in a sketch
Kinescopes of the 28 shows hosted by Martin Lewis have been airing Saturday evenings on the classic television network RTV since June 30 2012

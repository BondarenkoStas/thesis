Emilio and Rosa Mia are a loving couple expecting their first child
Rosa Mia is a devout aspiring singer who works at cheap bars to earn a living while Emilio is a security guard where Rosa Mia works
When the bar owner learns of their relationship and Rosa Mia s pregnancy a talk show host fires them from the club leaving them jobless and destitute yet optimistic
One night as Emilio was out seeking employment Rosa Mia goes into labour
With no one around she runs outside and into the pouring rain to get to the hospital
Fortunately Emilio arrives and sees Rosa Mia struggling but Rosa Mia already gives birth in the street to a baby girl they name Emilia Rose
Emilia Rose becomes a sickly child developing lung problems which brings her in and out of hospital
Rising medical bills force a desperate Rosa Mia to accept a month long singing engagement in Cebu leaving Emilio to care for the baby on his own
He brings Emillia Rose with him out on his new job as a security guard in another club
On one occasion Emilio s boss has him deliver a package to a different club so he leaves the baby with his acquaintance Adora a rose seller in the red light district of Malate
Adora agrees to mind the baby for a few minutes waiting outside the club for Emilio s return
Unbeknownst to Adora Emilio is arrested inside the club because the package turns out to filled with drugs
Adora waits all night for Emilio who never returns and brings the baby home with her
The loss of Emilia Rose and Emilio s imprisonment lead to bitterness and estrangement between Emilio and Rosa Mia
Adora has meanwhile grown to love the baby and decides to raise her as her own calling her Adorina or Dorina for short
Meanwhile with the loss of her child Rosa Mia throws herself into her music and is discovered by Lauro Calma a record producer
He develops Rosa Mia into a star asking her not to reveal that she is married and a mother
Rosa Mia agrees and soon rises to fame as the Sensational Diva
Dorina meanwhile grows up to be happily with Adora and both become avid fans of Rosa Mia
Meanwhile Lavinia an up and coming singer emerges on the scene
Her ambitious mother Barbara tells Lavinia to befriend Rosa Mia to boost her popularity
Lonely and vulnerable Rosa Mia takes Lavinia under her wing seeking a replacement for her lost daughter
With Rosa Mia s help Lavinia also becomes very popular which is not enough for Barbara who wants Lavinia to be on top
Barbara connives with Larry Calma the son of Rosa Mia s manager Lauro
Larry wants to prove himself to his father so he handles Lavinia and connives with Barbara to knock off Rosa Mia from the top spot leaving Lavinia as the ultimate and most popular singer
Through intrigue and character assassination they succeed in causing Rosa Mia to fall from grace bereft of her reputation and popularity
Rosa Mia decides to leave show business and returns to singing in small clubs
Soon Dorina begins to idolize Lavinia
She goes to her every concert show and personal appearances to catch a glimpse of her idol and offer her Sampaguita
But Dorina also loves to sing
With the help of Adora and her best friend Oman Dorina joins singing contests until she eventually wins in a nationwide and televised singing contest
She gains the attention of all including Nico Escobar the boyfriend of Lavinia
Nico is in love with Lavinia but it becomes clear that Lavinia is too involved in her career
She refuses to marry him fearing that doing so would damage her popularity
Bitter and angry Nico wants to show Lavinia that her career should not be top priority in her life so he plans to develop another singer as Lavinia s rival to supplant her
Nico uses Dorina to accomplish this and with his friend Zossimo sets up Zoni Records to develop Dorina s singing career
Dorina soon finds herself admiring Nico and developing feelings for him but she does not know how Nico feels about her
Dorina s interest in Nico comes as a blow to her best friend Oman and her bandmate Gary both of whom are in love with Dorina
Dorina gains fame causing Lavinia to see her as a threat
After a big event Lavinia becomes so enraged by Dorina s great performance and attention of all that she attacks Dorina and calls her a copycat spurring the latter to fight back
Nico and Zossimo find a song once composed by Rosa Mia before she left the music scene
They buy rights to the song from Rosa Mia and ask her to help Dorina with her singing
At first Rosa Mia refuses after what happened with Lavinia but she eventually relents and agrees to help her out
They soon become close not knowing of their real relationship
Not long after Emilio is released from prison and he sets out to find Adora and his daughter
He later succeeds only to learn that his daughter is now Dorina the singer he had been admiring while still in jail
Emilio decides not to tell Dorina of their true relationship for fear of ruining her career but to be close to his daughter he takes on a job as her chauffeur and bodyguard
Dorina eventually knows her real parents and at the last concert her emotions flow to the last song
Rosa Mia and Emilio are reunited Adora is gone while Nico forgives Lavinia and Oman and Dorina become a couple

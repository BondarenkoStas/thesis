U S
Senator Stuart Davis running against the Vice President plans a trip to the Balkans to negotiate the release of American servicemen being held hostage by terrorists
Before he leaves he receives a disk documenting evidence that the Vice President has been trying to revive the American economy by causing a war in the Balkans
He announces his plans at Washington Dulles International Airport to show it to both sides in the hopes of ending the situation
He boards Concorde flight 209 to Paris along with some Air Force Officers and news employees
Unexpected Secret Service agents turn up and board the Concorde
After takeoff the secret service agents led by Barry Rogers shoot an Air Force officer and his men hijack the Concorde in mid flight
Rogers takes Stuart Davis and the others hostage and forces him to hand over the disk in order to prevent the war being averted
In the cockpit Rogers announces to the Dulles International Airport air traffic controller that the agents are armed with a nuclear device and threaten to crash the Concorde into Paris
Air Force Officer Jack Tyree arrives at the cockpit and overpowers one of Rogers men accidentally shooting the co pilot in the process
He then helps fly the Concorde and later frees Davis
Later another agent arrives and shoots Captain Roman and takes Tyree hostage
Having brought with them two pairs of parachutes the men jump off the plane after revealing that there was no nuclear device aboard the aircraft
The two men land and steal a car and escape along some cliffs
On the other hand two French Secret Service Agents that have apparently overheard the hijacking chase Rogers and his men down the road towards a pre prepared road block
Rogers sets an electromagnetic pulse bomb to destroy the French car until the officer at the roadblock fires a shell at the agents causing them to skid off the road violently roll down the cliffs and break up killing Rogers and his men instantly
On the Concorde Jack Tyree and news employee Shannon Carpenter attempt to fly the Concorde but Jack can t fly an aircraft and is nicknamed washout
The aircraft s radio is damaged due to the previous fight with one of Rogers men
Since Shannon is a former mechanic she repairs the radio and restores contact with Paris Air Traffic control
Meanwhile with it having been rumoured that the agents planted a nuclear device on the Concorde Dulles air traffic control orders a nearby aircraft carrier to launch a fighter aircraft to intercept the Concorde before it reaches Paris
On the aircraft Shannon announces to Dulles and Paris Orly airport that there is no device on the aircraft and barely manages to order the fighter to abort after two near misses from its missiles
Because of the explosion of a nearby missile fired from the fighter the Concorde s fuel line is torn and is leaking fuel compromising the arrival at Paris
With the plane low on fuel Jack Tyree is instructed via radio to land the Concorde at the airport
The landing is successful and the passengers depart safely
Shannon having hidden the actual disk in the trash hands over the disk containing confidential files to Stuart Davis making it possible for the war to be averted
Jack and Shannon finally engage in a passionate kiss and the film ends displaying the Concorde

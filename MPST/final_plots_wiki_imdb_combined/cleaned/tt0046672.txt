20 000 Leagues Under the Sea is a film by Richard Fleischer based on the famous Jules Verne novel written in the 19th century
The film begins with the first page of the book talking about rumors of a mysterious sea monster that prowled the South Seas in 1868
The camera switches to an old fashioned ship sailing through apparently calm seas
A long dark object with glowing lights like eyes at its head appears a short distance away from the ship
It drives straight toward the ship making a loud whirring noise of a motor
It collides head on with the ship sinking it and sails off
A man standing before a crowd in San Francisco offers a bonus to any man who will ship with an expedition to hunt the mysterious monster
Another man interrupts him warning the crowd not to sign they will never make it back to collect their pay
He brings up an elderly seaman who tells a dramatic story of how the monster sunk the ship he was on and proceeds to give a vivid description of the monster
A young sailor Ned Land challenges the old sailor s claim and makes fun of the way his breath smells
His companion Casey hits him over the head with the sailor s cane and a fight breaks out
The police arrive and drag Ned Land away
Farther down the street French professor Pierre Aronnax and his apprentice Conseil are trying to find a ship that will take them to Saigon but are told that no one will sail through the South Seas
Three reporters ask for a statement from the professor about the monster but he gives them an ambiguous answer
Back at their apartments Aronnax reads the paper and sees that the reporters wildly misquoted him claiming that he believes in a huge seamonster

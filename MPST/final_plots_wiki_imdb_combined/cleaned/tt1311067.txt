In a short flashback Deborah Myers visits her son a young Michael Myers at Smith s Grove Sanitarium
Deborah gives Michael a white horse statuette as a gift
Michael says that the horse reminds him of a dream he had of Deborah s ghost all dressed in white and leading a horse down the sanitarium halls toward Michael telling him she was going to bring him home Flashing forward 15 years picking up where the first Halloween film left off a dazed and bloodied Laurie Strode is found wandering around in a state of shock and covered in blood after shooting the adult Michael Myers who attempted to kill her
Sheriff Brackett takes Laurie to the emergency room
Meanwhile the paramedics pick up the Sheriff s daughter Annie as well as Michael s psychiatrist Dr Loomis both of whom are still alive after having been attacked by Michael and take them to the hospital
Presumed dead Michael s lifeless body is loaded into a separate ambulance
When the driver has a traffic accident Michael awakens and escapes the ambulance walking toward a vision of his mother Deborah dressed in white and leading a white horse Michael appears at the hospital and begins murdering everyone he comes across on his way to Laurie
Trapped in a security outpost at the gate Laurie watches as Michael tears through the walls with an axe but just as he tries to kill her Laurie wakes up from the dream
It is actually two years later and Laurie is now living with the Bracketts
Michael s body has been missing since last Halloween still presumed dead and Laurie has been having recurring nightmares about the event
While Laurie deals with her trauma through therapy Loomis has chosen to turn the event into an opportunity to write another book Meanwhile Michael has been living in an abandoned cabin in the woods somewhere in the Midwest having grown long hair and a beard living like a mountain man while healing from his wounds he sustained in the previous film
Michael is revealed to be having visions of Deborah s ghost and a younger version of himself who instructs him that with Halloween approaching it is time to bring Laurie home so he sets off for Haddonfield As Michael travels to Haddonfield Laurie begins having hallucinations that mirror Michael s which involve a ghostly image of Deborah and a young Michael in a clown costume
In addition her hallucinations also begin to include her acting out Michael s murders like envisioning herself taping Annie to a chair and slitting her throat while dressed in a clown outfitsimilar to how a young Michael murdered Ronnie White While Laurie struggles with her dreams Loomis has been going on tour to promote his new book only to be greeted with criticism from people who blame him for Michael s actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael s victims
When his book is finally released Laurie discovers the truth that she is really Angel Boo Myers Michael s long lost sister
With the truth out she decides to go partying with her new friends Mya and Harley to escape how she is feeling Michael appears at the party and kills Harley then makes his way over to the Brackett house and stabs Annie repeatedly
When Laurie and Mya arrive back at the house they find Annie bloodied and dying
Michael kills Mya and then comes after Laurie who manages to escape from the house
While Laurie manages to flag down a passing motorist Sheriff Brackett arrives home and finds his daughter dead
Laurie gets into the motorist s car but before they can escape Michael kills the driver and flips the car over with Laurie still in it
Michael takes the unconscious Laurie to an abandoned shed he has been camping out in Laurie awakens to a vision of Deborah and a young Michael ordering her to say I love you Mommy
The police discover Michael s location and surround the shed
Loomis arrives and goes into the shed to try to reason Michael into letting Laurie go
Inside he has to inform Laurie who believes that the younger Michael is holding her down
But from Loomis point of view no one is restraining her and Loomis tries to tell her that she must maintain her sanity and not fall over the edge just like Michael did
Just then the ghost of Deborah instructs the older Michael that it is time to go home and Michael grabs Loomis and begins repeatedly slashing his face and stabbing him in the chest
Stepping in front of a window while holding Loomis s body Michael is shot twice by Sheriff Brackett and falls onto the spikes of some farming equipment
Apparently released of the visions Laurie walks over and tells Michael she loves him then she stabs him repeatedly in the chest and finally in the face
The shed door opens and Laurie walks out wearing Michael s mask As she pulls the mask off the scene transitions to Laurie in isolation in a psychiatric ward with a deranged grin on her face as a vision of Deborah dressed in white stands with a white horse at the end of her room

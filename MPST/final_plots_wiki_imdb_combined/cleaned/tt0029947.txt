David Huxley is a mild mannered paleontologist
For the past four years he has been trying to assemble the skeleton of a Brontosaurus but is missing one bone the intercostal clavicle
Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to the dour Alice Swallow and the need to impress Elizabeth Random who is considering a million dollar donation to his museum
The day before his wedding David meets Susan Vance by chance on a golf course
She is a free spirited young lady and Mrs Random s niece
Susan s brother Mark has sent her a tame leopard from Brazil named Baby to give to their aunt
Susan thinks David is a zoologist and persuades David to go to her country home in Connecticut to help bring up Baby
Complications arise since Susan has fallen in love with David and tries to keep him at her house as long as possible to prevent his marriage
David finally receives the intercostal clavicle but Susan s dog George takes it out of its box and buries it
Susan s aunt Elizabeth Random arrives
The dowager is unaware of David s identity since Susan has introduced him as Mr
Bone
Baby and George run off and Susan and David mistake a dangerous leopard who was being driven to be euthanized from a nearby circus for Baby and let it out of the cage
After considerable running around David and Susan are jailed by a befuddled town policeman Constable Slocum for breaking into the house of Dr Fritz Lehman
When Slocum does not believe their story Susan tells him they are members of the Leopard Gang she calls herself Swingin Door Susie and David Jerry the Nipper
David fails to convince the constable that Susan makes things up from motion pictures she s seen
Eventually Alexander Peabody shows up to verify everyone s identity
Susan who during a police interview contrived to sneak out a window unwittingly drags the irritated circus leopard into the jail
David saves her using a chair to shoo the big cat into a cell
Some time later Susan finds David who has just been jilted by Alice because of her on a high platform at his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum
After showing him the missing bone which she d found by trailing George for three days Susan against his warnings climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur to be closer to him
She tells David that her Aunt has given her the million dollars and she wants to donate it to the museum but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life
Unconsciously swaying the ladder from side to side upon hearing David s further words of endearment and love Susan tells him that she loves him too then notices that the ladder is on the verge of falling over
Frightened she climbs onto and over the skeleton but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand she dangles below him and he lifts her onto the platform
Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work David soon accepts the destruction and chaos gives in and hugs and kisses Susan

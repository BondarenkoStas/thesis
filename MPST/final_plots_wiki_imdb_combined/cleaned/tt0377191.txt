After attaining his drivers licence on his 16th birthday naive teenager Vert Wheeler discovers the Deora II Hot Wheels car
The door on the front of the car opens and a monitor shows a recording of a mysterious man named Dr Peter Tezla inviting him to a competition called the World Race a contest between seasoned professionals and talented drivers
Driving to a secret location in the Californian desert the drivers are informed of the race along an interdimensional racetrack called Highway 35 created by extraterrestrial beings called Accelerons
At the end of the race is the Wheel of Power
Tezla himself tried to retrieve it remotely with little success
His plan is to use the drivers with their unique driving abilities to retrieve the wheel on his behalf
To enter the Highway each driver must be doing 300 mph at specific points around the world
During the start Vert immediately starts a rivalry with Taro Kitano leader of the Scorchers team and Lani Tam a driver of another Wave Rippers car like Vert s
During the first leg the drivers are given a test of the type of track Highway 35 is and the abilities of their cars
One such stunt is a mile high loop followed by a jump over a lava river
Further on in a volcano a mysterious black racer known as Zed 36 detonates a rigged bottle of Nitrox2 which causes lava to flow over the road
Vert and Taro make it through but Lani gets caught in the flow and is forced to jump onto a nearby boulder
Taro immediately drives back to help her eventually followed by Vert
All drivers finish the leg last with the leader of the Street Breed team Kurt Wylde being victorious
Before the second leg each leader must make up five teams of seven the Wave Rippers Scorchers Street Breed Dune Ratz and Roadbeasts
Vert recruits his best friend Alec Wood and Kurt s little brother Markie after watching him joyride in Kurt s car
During the next leg a mountainous stage the leader of the Roadbeasts Banjee Castillo discovers a possible shortcut through a jungle valley
The Wave Rippers curious of the Roadbeasts decision follow in pursuit
Things seem to go well for the Roadbeasts until they come across a large wheel obstacle which they ll need to cross
Whilst crossing it with the Wave Rippers Zed 36 had a slingshot weapon ready to fire at the wheel but hesitates after seeing Markie race towards it
After clipping the wheels as he crosses which causes one of his Nitrox to detact and deonate the wheels speeds up forcing Vert and Banjee to jump at speed
Meanwhile both Taro and the leader of the Dune Ratz Brian Kadeem reach the portal first causing a tie
In the third leg in a desert Kadeem spots a disc on top of a pyramid
Believing it to be the Wheel of Power he takes it with Zed 36 taking chase
After a minor scuffle Zed 36 s helmet is knocked off and he s revealed to be Kurt Wylde
When he reaches the portal to head back to earth the disc disintegrated disappointing Kadeem
Revealing to Vert he had hoped that he would win the race so he would use the prize money to aid his war torn people in Africa
Meanwhile as Kurt scarpers from the race he is found by his employers CLYP led by a mysterious woman named Gelorum
As the drivers are about to start the fourth leg of the race Kurt with several CLYP racers make a break for the portal enticing the other racers to follow
Throughout the ice leg the CLYP racers try and sabotage the race by blocking the track and dropping mines
When Markie who was leading detonates a mine which sees himself unconscious hanging over a cliff Kurt betrays the CLYP drivers revealed to be drones to help Markie
However he continues to race Markie then Vert to retrieve the Wheel of Power for Gelorum
He is defeated by Vert who continues out of the ice and into a mysterious city with the Wheel of Power perched on top of a spire in the city s center
Vert and the Wave Rippers are named the winners and are awarded 5 million prize money
However wanting to race on Highway 35 again storm into Tezla s lab where Tezla had been researching the Wheel
After the Wheel s powers short circuits the facility s power Tezla admits the Wheel is too powerful and asked the racers to return it
Meanwhile Gelorum and her drones surround the facility demanding the wheel
The racers managed to subdue the drones even bringing Gelorum s chopper down as well revealing she is a robot as well
Racing back into the city the racers including a defecting Kurt after realizing what Gelorum was hold off the drones long enough for Vert to replace the Wheel on top of the spire lighting up the city
In reflection the racers name the city Hot Wheels City
Afterwards Vert gives his prize money to Kadeem knowing that the money may not solve their issues but it helps
Once returned to Earth Vert is surprised to see his father at Tezla s facility and while given him a drive in Deora II accidentally activates the Nitrox accelerating the car to 300 mph and activating the portal

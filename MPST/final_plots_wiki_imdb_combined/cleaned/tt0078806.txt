Emma has a strong aversion towards her family s new house especially the attic
After moving in she becomes miserable and reclusive
The rest of her family also seems unhappy and unsettled
The situation escalates one day when Emma is in the attic alone
All of a sudden someone who looks exactly like Emma attacks her viciously
Emma is convinced that someone or something is haunting her and she refuses to leave her house until she can piece the puzzle together with the assistance of John Trevor a sympathetic detective
Eventually Emma suspects her parents of hiding skeletons in the closet from the family s past and practicing magical rituals using symbols Wicca seemingly stole from satanism
As the clues pile up she discovers that she once had a sister named Beth who died twelve days after Emma was born
Emma realizes that this identical apparition may actually be Beth returning to life
Emma witnesses Beth kill her brother and the police suspect it was really Emma
John Trevor comes to the rescue when Beth is trying to strangle Emma to death and leaves her with a gun
She suspects that her father was to blame and murders both her parents
When the police arrive Emma threatens John Trevor who now claims to be a paramedic with the gun he gave her
As she points the gun at Trevor she is really pointing the gun at herself and when she pulls the trigger she kills herself
The police later discuss the incident and Emma s former psychologist explains that Beth and Trevor were only in her mind
Another officer mentions that the previous owner of the house mysteriously died
The psychologist says that houses do not kill people but in this case it did
The film ends as new family looks to buy the house
As a young girl about Emma s age explores the attic John Trevor now a real estate agent called Ron appears behind her and says they will be seeing a lot of each other

Murli Prasad Sharma alias Munna Bhai a gangster who is in love with the voice of Janhavi a radio jockey devises a plan to meet her when she announces a quiz contest featuring the life and beliefs of Mahatma Gandhi to be aired on 2 October the birthday of Gandhi
To prepare for the contest Munna s sidekick Circuit kidnaps and bribes a group of professors to provide the answers for Munna
After winning the contest Munna is granted an interview with Janhavi wherein he presents himself as a professor of history and a Gandhi specialist
Janhavi subsequently asks Munna to present a lecture on Gandhi to a community of senior citizens who live in her home called the Second Innings House
To prepare for this event Munna engages in intense study at a Gandhi institute
For three days and nights Munna reads about the life and ideologies of Gandhi
It is during this period that the image of Gandhi addressed by his nickname Bapu appears and offers help and advice to Munna
Gandhi encourages Munna to tell the truth about himself to Janhavi but Munna resists this advice
With Gandhi s help Munna succeeds in impressing Jahnavi and cultivates a new lifestyle based upon Gandhism
Munna starts to co host a radio show with Janhavi and Gandhi s image guiding his audience to use Gandhigiri to solve everyday problems
The film has several subplots
One of the most prominent of these details the story of Lucky Singh and his daughter Simran
Lucky is an unscrupulous businessman who employs Circuit and Munna Bhai to conduct underworld activities for him
His daughter Simran is engaged to marry Sunny the son of the powerful businessman Kkhurana
Kkhurana is superstitious and his activities are controlled by his astrologer Batuk Maharaj whose particular use of numerology led Kkhurana to add an extra K to his real name as well as to the conclusion that the Second Innings House would be the most auspicious place for Sunny and Simran to live
Maharaj also convinces Kkhurana to reject the marriage between Simran and Sunny when it is revealed that Simran is considered to be a manglik
Lucky appropriates the Second Innings House by sending Munna to Goa and then blackmailing him to let the matter pass or risk losing his love Janvi
In response Munna launches a non violent protest to reclaim the house
He calls this protest Get Well Soon Lucky and asks his radio show s audience to send Lucky flowers to help him recover from the disease of dishonesty
During this time Munna tells Janhavi the truth
Heartbroken Janhavi leaves Munna
Munna receives another setback when he is tricked by Lucky into revealing his conversations with Gandhi before a public audience
At this conference Munna finds that only after he has learned something about Bapu s life can the Gandhi image talk about it which serves as proof for a psychiatrist in the audience that Munna is delusional
Gandhi s monologue at the end of the film however questions this conclusion
Munna despite these defeats continues to use Gandhigiri a decision that transforms Lucky revives Janhavi s affection and resolves Simran s marriage
Lucky Singh eventually becomes a student of Gandhigiri and is greeted by Gandhi s image not long after he has begun to study Bapu s life
Immediately he calls for a photograph to be taken of them together this perplexes the photographer who cannot see the Gandhi image

This film contains the memoirs of one Lt
Earnest Goodbody of 3rd troop 4th Musketeers albeit presented to us via 2 perspectives Early on in the film the lieutenant is captured while attempting to cross the Rhine river and secure the last intact bridge for the Allies
He intermittently recounts his story to a German officer while we the viewing audience are also treated to what really happened His earliest recollections are of his officer training under Lt
Colonel Grapple who is shown to be as oblivious to the suffering of his charges as Goodbody proves to be
During the introduction of the story we meet the men under Goodbody s command Transom the unit s suffering second in command who proves to be the only true hard working soldier in the group
He is reluctant to take charge of the situations they find themselves in but often does
He encourages the others to kill the Lieutenant and resists the temptation several times
Portrayed by Lee Montague Dooley the unit s third in command
While he and Transom start at the same rank in the beginning he seems more than willing to place most of the rank induced responsibilities in the other man s hands
In fact he acts more like a lackey to Transom than an equal
Portrayed by Ewan Hooper Gripweed the Lieutenant s batman
He is a compulsive thief and admits to having been a former member of the British Fascist Party
He seems to show some naivete regarding the true nature of war and the incapabilities of his unit and often is found both chiding and being sycophantic towards Goodbody
Portrayed by then Beatle John Lennon Juniper serves as both the unit s crusty old veteran and the would be comic relief man
He appears more than willing to spur the rest of the group on to do things but is unwilling to do any real fighting
Throughout the film we see him appear in various comedic guises
He is perceived by the others to be going insane and as the film progresses he promotes himself both in rank and as a master strategist
Portrayed by Jack MacGowran Clapper the realist of the group
He is constantly harboring the belief that his wife is cheating on him back home
While like the rest of the unit he has little respect for Goodbody he goes to him for advice numerous times
He also endures the most criticism from Transom regarding his general appearance as a soldier
Portrayed by Roy Kinnear Drogue resigned to dying in North Africa he is constantly willing off his possessions to other members of the unit
While he s one of the few to show some level of bravery in the film he is also shown not to be too careful
Portrayed by James Cossins Spool the wireless radio operator for the unit
The only major fault that can be attributed to him is that he s probably the clumsiest member of the group
Portrayed by Ronald Lacey The Melancholy Musketeer the resident coward of the group who seems to be completely unaware of what he s fighting for and why he signed up in the first place
He flees for cover in the middle of battle and at one point even abandons the group
Portrayed by Jack Hedley The unit s first assignment is to land behind enemy lines and set up an advance cricket pitch at an oasis
The purpose of the mission to give Allied soldiers something to look forward to when they take that particular region
Any other unit would have felt disgraced to accept such a mission but Lt Goodbody takes it with pride The mission immediately is bungled when Goodbody accidentally orders signal rockets fired
In the hustle to avoid being cratered the unit loses half of their vehicles and Dooley is killed In a twist of surrealism each soldier that dies under the Lieutenant s command returns immediately after replaced by a soldier painted to resemble a plastic army man
From Goodbody s perspective that man is still alive
Footage shown during the death scenes of these characters is tinted a certain color for each incident and the dead soldier returns in that color With half of their vehicles gone and little fuel remaining Goodbody decides to raid a German fuel dump on their way to the oasis
In spite of mounting excitement from some of the men the raid on the fuel dump ends predictably in failure seeing as only 3 of the men are willing to advance on the outpost once it s realized that the Germans have heavy machine guns
Drogue is killed and Goodbody is nearly killed in a one on one fight with an enemy soldier who is promptly killed by Transom with a bayonet
After the retreat a light plane spots them and attacks
Goodbody ignores the hail of bullets flying around him to point out how to signal an oncoming plane and goes into a minor tantrum upon discovery that their roller full of water is missing
He spots a group of off duty Italian soldiers playing soccer nearby and immediately spouts racial slurs against them and accuses them of stealing their roller
While this is going on Transom grabs a submachine gun and shoots down the plane marking their first real victory In the ensuing explosion of the plane s wreckage the Melancholy Musketeer panics and attempts to flee in one of their trucks
Juniper destroys it leaving the Musketeer to flee with his pants on fire
The rest of the group carries on towards the oasis
The men stop near the edge of a cliff only to find themselves in the middle of a minefield
Spool going mad with dehydration and heat stress runs to the roller for a drink and begins to throw a fit after the discovery that Gripweed had let the water out to make the roller easy to move
Goodbody ends up being the last one to find out about the mines
In the ensuing chaos the film breaks the fourth wall and two ladies discuss a similar fit suffered by a son of one of the ladies Colonel Grapple arrives moments later and gives them some water and spurs them to carry on and take the oasis
In a lengthy death scene the men take the oasis seemingly without a real fight and while rounding up prisoners a rifle lands butt first on the ground firing off a live round that strikes Spool in the head While the men are setting up the cricket pitch the Melancholy Musketeer turns up having been hiding in an enemy truck at the oasis
Juniper berates him for cowardice and in his rage he strikes the Musketeer as well as Goodbody and Colonel Grapple
He is put on an immediate court martial while the other men in the unit attempt to play cricket with the German captives looking on
Eventually the General who gave them the assignment arrives with another high ranking officer who merely points out that the men are rotten bowlers
Juniper hitches a ride with the officers as they leave During the intermissions of these scenes and the ones to come Goodbody and Odlebog the German officer discuss their views on how the war should be fought and Odlebog is appalled to discover that Goodbody is a fascist at heart
The two men seem to have plenty in common in spite of their current circumstances The flashbacks then take us to the Allied advance towards the Rhine river
Goodbody s men are among those tasked with making a foothold along the river
Goodbody accidentally shoots the Melancholy Musketeer in the foot cutting his unit short by yet another man
While passing through a village Gripweed steals a milk bottle while laughing hysterically accidentally giving their position away to the nearby German forces
The remaining troops hole up in and around a German farmhouse but are forced to retreat as a tank approaches with infantry as support
Clapper is cornered by two enemy soldiers and stabbed with a bayonet
Gripweed discovers another British soldier holed up in a shelled out barn looting a corpse
Gripweed derides the man and dismisses him as an amateur thief but unfortunately is forced to run when German mortars start raining on the barn
As he crosses an open field a mortar lands right in front of him perforating him with shrapnel
He solemnly looks at the camera and says I knew this would happen
You knew it would happen didn t you
As Goodbody and Transom retreat a German flamethrower operator nearly corners them
They kill the man and Transom flees as the enemy tank approaches
Goodbody yells for him to come back to their cover and Transom is mowed down by a tank mounted machine gun in the confusion As we return to the present Odlebog realizes that in spite of his orders to destroy the bridge he feels it would be much better if he let Goodbody have it as it would end the war and bring his retirement sooner
In what appears to be a slant against capitalism the two negotiate a price and Goodbody writes him a check for it
Meanwhile Grapple leads the push to the bridge in a tank and is the first to cross
He runs over Odlebog in the process leaving Goodbody with a small piece of the cold hard reality of war that he had missed all those times before
He then addresses his men with optimism over the inevitable end of World War II The film ends with a post war reunion orchestrated by Goodbody with the Melancholy Musketeer obviously being the only one who shows up
The Musketeer says there was a good reason for fighting but Goodbody points out that HE had won the war

In the far north of France filmed in Bailleul a girl of 11 is raped and murdered as she walked to her parents remote farm from the school bus
Called onto the case Inspector Pharaon de Winter feels extreme revulsion
After losing his wife and child in an accident he now lives quietly with his widowed mother
At the weekend his neighbour Domino who is sympathetic to his shocked state asks him to join her and her lover Joseph a bus driver
They go to the seaside and to a restaurant but the reserved Pharaon finds Joseph ignorant and coarse
The police investigation moves slowly with Pharaon looking into possibilities such as whether the murderer was a bus driver or a psychiatric patient
Noting that the murder site could be seen from Eurostar trains he goes to London to interview passengers
But with no firm lead the case is taken over by the Lille police
The factory where Domino works goes on strike and the police led by Pharaon have to quell a demonstration
Though outwardly angry in fact Domino admires his quiet determination and offers herself to him
But he is not ready for such a relationship and his mother warns her off
Then the Lille police arrest Joseph
When Pharaon gets to the police station he finds him beaten up and weeping
Being a man of deep feeling he comforts him
When he goes home his mother is out and Domino is at the kitchen table weeping
He comforts her
The final shot shows Pharaon sitting in a chair in his office at the police station staring out the window with handcuffs visibly shackling his wrists

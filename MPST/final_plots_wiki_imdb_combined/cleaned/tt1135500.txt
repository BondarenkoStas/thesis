After having lived in the United States for several years Teddy brings his wife Ruth home for the first time to meet his working class family in North London where he grew up and which she finds more familiar than their arid academic life in America
Much sexual tension occurs as Ruth teases Teddy s brothers and father and the men taunt one another in a game of oneupmanship resulting in Ruth s staying behind with Teddy s relatives as one of the family and Teddy and their three sons returning home to America without her
Act one The play begins in the midst of what becomes an ongoing power struggle between the two more dominant men the father Max and his middle son Lenny
Max and the other men put down one another expressing their feelings of resentment with Max feminising his brother Sam while ironically himself claiming to have himself given birth to his three sons
Teddy arrives with his wife Ruth
He reveals that he married Ruth in London six years earlier and that the couple subsequently moved to America and had three sons prior to his returning to the family home to introduce her
Ruth s and Teddy s discomfort with each other marked by her restless desire to go out exploring after he goes to bed and followed by her sexually suggestive first time encounter with her brother in law Lenny begins to expose that there are problems in the marriage
After a sexually charged conversation between Lenny and Ruth Ruth exits
Awakened by their voices Max comes downstairs
Lenny does not tell Max about Teddy s and Ruth s arrival at the house and engages in more verbal sparring with Max
The scene ends in a blackout
When the lights come up the scene has changed to the following morning
Max comes down to make breakfast
When Teddy and Ruth appear and he discovers that they have been there all night without his knowledge Max is initially enraged assuming that Ruth is a prostitute
After being told that Ruth and Teddy have married and that she is his daughter in law Max appears to make some effort to reconcile with his son Teddy
Act two This act opens with the men s ritual of sharing the lighting of cigars after lunch ending with Teddy s cigar going out prematurely and symbolically
Max s subsequent sentimental reminiscences of family life with Jessie and their boys and his experiences as a butcher also end abruptly with a cynical twist
After Teddy s marriage to Ruth receives Max s blessing Ruth appears to let her guard down
She relaxes and focusing their attention on her she reveals some details about her previous life before meeting Teddy and how she views America
After Max and his brothers exit Teddy abruptly suggests to Ruth that they return home immediately
Apparently he knows about her past history as a photographic model for the body and about which she reminisces when talking to Lenny alone after Teddy has gone upstairs to pack for their return trip to America
When he returns with the suitcases and Ruth s coat he expresses concern about what else Lenny may have gotten Ruth to reveal
As Teddy looks on Lenny initiates dancing slowly with her
With Teddy Max and Joey all looking on Lenny kisses Ruth and then turns her over to Joey who asserts that she s wide open Old Lenny s got a tart in here
Joey begins making out with Ruth on the sofa telling Lenny that she is Just up my street
Max asks Teddy if he is going so soon ironically he tells Teddy Look next time you come over don t forget to let us know beforehand whether you re married or not
I ll always be glad to meet the wife
He says that he knows that Teddy had not told him that he was married because he was ashamed that he had married a woman beneath him just before peering to look at Ruth who is literally still lying under Joey
Max adds that Teddy doesn t need to be ashamed of Ruth s social status assuring Teddy that he is a broadminded man and she s a lovely girl
A beautiful woman as well as a mother too
A mother of three
Contrary to the concurrent action even more ironically Max observes that Teddy has made a happy woman out of her
It s something to be proud of right after Max further asserts that Ruth is a woman of quality and a woman of feeling clasped in their ongoing embrace Joey and Ruth roll off the sofa on to the floor
Suddenly pushing Joey away and standing up Ruth appears to take command asking for food and drink and Joey and Lenny attempt to satisfy her demands
After Ruth questions whether or not his family has read Teddy s critical works leading Teddy to defend his own intellectual equilibrium and professional turf Ruth and Joey go upstairs for what Lenny later says turns out to be a two hour sexual encounter in bed without going the whole hog
While Ruth is still upstairs Lenny and the others reminisce about Lenny s and Joey s sexual exploits
Lenny whom the family considers an expert in sexual matters labels Ruth a tease to which Teddy replies Perhaps he hasn t got the right touch
Lenny retorts that Joey has had more dolly than you ve had cream cakes is irresistible to the ladies one of the few and far between
Lenny relates anecdotes about Joey s sexual prowess with other birds
When Lenny asks Joey Don t tell me you re satisfied without going the whole hog
Joey tentatively replies that sometimes a man can be happy without going any hog
Lenny stares at him
Joey seems to be suggesting that Ruth is good at the game that Lenny ultimately gets the idea to put her on Lenny proposes to Max that he take her up with me to Greek Street
Max volunteers that Ruth could come to live with the family suggesting that they should keep her while she works for them part time as a prostitute
The men discuss this proposal in considerable detail seemingly half joking to irritate Teddy and half serious
Sam declares the whole idea silly and rubbish Teddy adamantly refuses to put anything in the kitty as Max asks and Lenny suggests that Teddy could hand out business cards and refer Americans he knows to Ruth when they visit London for a little percentage
Ruth comes downstairs dressed and apparently ready to join Teddy who is still waiting with his coat on and their packed suitcases
Teddy informs her of the family s proposal without going into explicit detail about their intention to engage her in prostitution saying euphemistically that she will have to pull her weight financially because they are not very well off then he offers her a choice to stay in London with the family or to return to America with him
Ruth appears far more interested in the idea of staying with them
She negotiates the terms of their contract using business terminology in a professional manner that makes her seem adept at getting what she wants in such transactions
Teddy prepares to return to America without her
Having spoken up a few times earlier to voice his objections Sam blurts out a long kept secret about Jessie and Max s friend MacGregor then croaks and collapses and lies still on the floor
Briefly considering the possibility that Sam has dropped dead and become a corpse the others ascertain that he is still breathing dismiss his revelation as the product of a diseased imagination and mostly ignore his body
After a pause Ruth accepts their proposal Yes it sounds like a very attractive idea
Teddy focuses on the inconvenience that Sam s unavailability poses for him I was going to ask him to drive me to London airport
Instead he gets directions to the Underground before saying goodbye to the others and leaving to return home to his three sons in America alone
As he moves towards the front door Ruth calls Teddy Eddie after he turns around she tells him Don t become a stranger
He goes out the door leaving his wife with the other four men in the house
The final tableau vivant depicts Ruth sitting relaxed in her chair as if on a throne
Sam lies motionless on the floor Joey who has walked over to Ruth places his head in her lap and Lenny stands looking on
After repeatedly insisting that he is not an old man and getting no reply from Ruth who remains silent Max beseeches her Kiss me the final words of the play
Ruth sits and continues to touch JOEY s head lightly while Lenny still stands watching
In this resolution of the play what might happen later remains unresolved
Such lack of plot resolution and other ambiguities are features of most of Pinter s dramas

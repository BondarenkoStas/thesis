The film begins with Nazi mad scientist Dr Kurt Leopold in his lab where he has lived alone for about 20 years
He is contemplating his former colleagues derision for his formula which is described as ZaAt

He injects himself with the serum and immerses himself in a tank connected to an array of equipment of an unspecified nature emerging as a furred fish like monster
His first act of revenge on the society that he feels has wronged him is to release several smaller walking catfish around the town s lakes and river an annoyance to the townspeople and releases Zaat into the local water supply rendering many of the townspeople ill Leopold decides to kill the colleagues that scoffed at his work
He begins with a character named Maxson
In a lake where Maxson is fishing Leopold swims under Maxson s boat overturns it and proceeds to kill Maxson and Maxson s son
Maxson s wife escapes although she is in shock from the attack

His perseverance pays off when she strips down to a yellow bikini to go swimming
She dives into the lake swimming carefree until Leopold catches her underwater
He swims with her to his lab even as she struggles in vain to escape
At the lab the bikini clad girl is lying strapped down in a mesh basket next to the large tank of Zaat
She is unconscious and Leopold reveals his intentions to make her his mate
Leopold injects Zaat into her neck
As she is immersed into a tank of Zaat the girl wakes up and struggles against the ropes holding her
The equipment malfunctions for reasons unknown and her corpse partially transformed is pulled from the tank
The movie strangely diverts from the storyline for approximately 10 15 minutes to show a lingering scene of the town sheriff Lou watching a small group of youths playing religious folk music
After one of the youths finishes leading the group in a song the town s sheriff Lou places them all in the town s jail presumably for their own protection
Leopold attempts to kidnap another mate
His choice is Martha Walsh the lovely female member of the INPIT scientific team sent to investigate the weird happenings in the town
Leopold grabs her after her male counterparts leave her alone
Leopold takes her to his lab but two of her companions are waiting there
Leopold kills them violently
He injects her with Zaat readies her to be dunked into the tank and makes his getaway with canisters of Zaat
Martha s transformation does not go as planned and she gets saved from getting dunked in the tank by one of her dying male companions as Leopold flees toward the ocean
Despite being saved from the transformation she appears to be in a trance and immediately follows Leopold into the sea
The movie ends ambiguously with Leopold seen shot but not killed

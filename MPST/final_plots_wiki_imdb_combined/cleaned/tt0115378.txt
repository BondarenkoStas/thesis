On the planet Krypton using evidence provided by scientist Jor El the Council sentences attempted insurrectionists General Zod Ursa and Non to the Phantom Zone
For this Zod swears revenge on Jor El and his family
Jor El despite his eminence is unable to convince the Council that Krypton will soon be destroyed when its red supergiant sun goes supernova
To save his infant son Kal El Jor El launches a spacecraft containing him toward Earth a planet with a suitable atmosphere where Kal El s dense molecular structure will give him superhuman powers
Shortly after the launch Krypton s sun explodes destroying the planet
The ship crash lands on Earth near Smallville Kansas
Kal El who is now three years old is found by Jonathan and Martha Kent who are astonished when he is able to lift their truck
They take him to their farm and raise him as their own naming him Clark after Martha s maiden name
At 18 soon after Jonathan s death due to a heart attack Clark hears a psychic call and discovers a glowing crystal in the remains of his spacecraft
It compels him to travel to the Arctic where the crystal builds the Fortress of Solitude
Inside a holographic vision of Jor El appears and explains Clark s origins educating him on his powers and responsibilities
After 12 years of training with his powers fully developed he leaves the Fortress wearing a blue and red suit with the House of El family crest on his chest and becomes a reporter at the Daily Planet in Metropolis
He meets and develops an unrequited romantic attraction to co worker Lois Lane
Lois becomes involved in a helicopter accident where conventional means of rescue are impossible requiring Clark to use his powers in public for the first time to save her and goes on to thwart a jewel thief attempting to scale the Solow Building using suction cups captures robbers fleeing police in the Fulton Market depositing their cabin cruiser on Wall Street and rescues a girl s cat from a tree in Brooklyn Heights
Clark also rescues Air Force One after a lightning strike destroys the port outboard engine making the caped wonder an instant celebrity
He visits Lois at her home the next night and takes her for a flight over the city allowing her to interview him for an article in which she names him Superman
Meanwhile criminal genius Lex Luthor has developed a plan to make a fortune in real estate by buying large amounts of barren desert land
After learning that the U S Army and U S Navy will launch a twin nuclear missile test he diverts one missile to a weak point in the San Andreas Fault
Knowing Superman could stop his plan Luthor lures him to an underground lair and reveals his plan and exposes him to Kryptonite
As Superman weakens Luthor further taunts him by revealing that the first missile is headed east toward Hackensack New Jersey aware that even Superman cannot stop both impacts
Eve Teschmacher Luthor s accomplice is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to a slow death
Knowing his reputation for keeping his word Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition that he will deal with the New Jersey missile first
After Superman diverts the eastbound missile into outer space the other one explodes near the San Andreas Fault
He is able to mitigate the effects of the nuclear explosion getting rid of the pollution from the fallout and shoring up the crumbling Earth but the aftershocks damage the Golden Gate Bridge and cause the Hollywood Sign and the Hoover Dam to collapse
While Superman is busy saving others from the aftershocks Lois s car ends up falling into a crevice that opens from one of them
It quickly fills with dirt and debris and she suffocates to death
Angered at being unable to save her Superman defies Jor El s earlier warning not to manipulate human history preferring to heed Jonathan s advice that he must be on Earth for a reason
He accelerates around the Earth rewinding time in order to save Lois
He then delivers Luthor and Otis to prison and flies into the sunrise for further adventures

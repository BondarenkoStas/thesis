Bra Boys the documentary is a film about the cultural evolution of the inner Sydney beachside suburb of Maroubra and the social struggle of its youth the tattooed and much maligned surf community known as the Bra Boys
The story is narrated by Australian actor Russell Crowe and is told through the eyes of members of the Bra Boys It shows how the evolution of Maroubra coupled with the historical stigma associated with Australias rebellious surf community has contributed to their social displacement
It is a surf documentary yet one that looks beyond the clich√©d artistic beauty of the sport to expose the sometimes troubled tale of its participants It is the first full length film project being undertaken by and officially sanctioned by the Bra Boys
It is their story
It shows their success in professional big wave surfing it explores their international reputation for hard partying and rough justice it touches on their running battle with authorities and it shows their absolute reliance on one another to fit into a society in which they are displaced and at times disinterested Central to the story is the true life struggle of the Abberton brothers Sunny Koby Jai and Dakota one charged with murdering a Sydney standover man another pursuing a professional surf career but charged as an accessory in his brothers legal fight another trying to hold the family together and a young brother whose inheritance is his siblings notoriety Bra Boys the documentary uses archival footage shot by the Bra Boys and blends it with current surf vision and interviews to create a story that is compassionate and confronting
It is a story of contrast involving against the odds success and predictable failures and ultimately a story exploring the legacy and hopes of the next generation of Bra Boys members SUNNY ABBERTONSunny Abberton is a 34 year old first time writer director and producer Sunny was born in Sydney Australia as the oldest of four brothers and spent his formative years between Maroubras housing estates New Zealand and a hippy commune in Nimbin
Sunny and brothers Jai and Koby were taught to surf by their grandfather and would find the beach their only escape from a troubled and destitute home life Sunny showed talent as a young surfer and left school at age 15 to pursue a career in the sport
Sunny competed on the competitive ASP Pro Tour in the late 1980s and early 1990s in which he gained a reputation as one of the best junior surfers in the world
Fortuitously this early career path took him to countries such as Brazil and South Africa where he was introduced to class injustices and economic oppression for the first time on a global scale While he was in Brazil he discovered a childrens reading book written to teach the poorest Brazilian children about the Landless Movement which was a turning point for Sunny
Through this piece of literature he first gained an insight into the power of the arts to have the potential to enlighten and inform particularly the young and the oppressed
Sensing parallels between the injustices experienced by the lower echelons of these societies and the poverty he had witnessed in the housing commission estates of his native Maroubra Sunny set out to create a voice which could inspire the youth of his own backyard
Thus the idea for BRA BOYS was born Meanwhile back in Maroubra an escalation in tensions among various Sydney communities was beginning to manifest in violence on Sydneys eastern beaches
Gangs would regularly travel to the beaches and it sparked a series of bloody confrontations
The youth at Maroubra banded together to defend their beach and create a brotherhood to protect one another
Sunny was part of the resistance and together with a small group of mates formed a group they termed the Bra Boys From his days on the Pro Surf tours Sunny had a wealth of experience in front of the camera and he used this exposure to learn the tricks of the trade through a mixture of osmosis and curiosity
Years of filming surf travelogues on home video cameras also helped to equip him for his first feature documentary shoot It was about six months into the filming of the documentary that his brother Jai was charged with murdering a Sydney standover man a blow later amplified when his brother Koby was charged as an accessory after the fact
Together with a local production company Sunny spent an additional three years filming the central figures within the Bra Boys community including the legal struggle of his two brothers He collected hundreds of hours of film out of which the Bra Boys documentary was compiled
Sunny was the writer producer and director of the film As the informally appointed patriarch of both the Abberton family and then the larger group known as the Bra Boys Sunny had always felt a deep responsibility for both the internal and external perception of the group
Through this documentary Sunny hopes to give inspiration and a voice to the youth of Maroubra and others in Australia who have grown up in similar circumstances as well as provide an arena to share their experiences in a public forum Sunny currently lives at Maroubra Beach in Sydney Australia
BRA BOYS is his first feature film and he currently has another two projects in development one of which is a feature adaptation of the BRA BOYS documentary KOBY ABBERTONKoby Abberton is a 27 year old professional surfer who has built a career as a specialist big wave charger
He is one of just a handful of surfers paid to find and surf the worlds biggest waves He was born in Sydney Australia and grew up the third eldest of four brothers
He was raised in the government housing estates of Maroubra Beach save for two years of his early childhood spent between temporary homes in New Zealand and subsequently a commune in Nimbin in northern New South Wales His early years in Maroubra were spent living in the garage of his grandparents home only moving out when his mother was issued with a small apartment in a nearby government housing estate Koby like his elder brothers was taught to surf by his grandfather and found the beach the only escape from a troubled family life
He was educated at Maroubra Bay public school but after failing to adjust to the regimented school life he left when aged just 14
Shortly thereafter he left home after being struck with a baseball bat by his mothers heroin addicted partner
He moved from house to house staying for extended periods with the families of his mates from the beach before moving in with older brother Sunny
He would also go on to become a founding member of the Bra Boys surf group a fearsome brotherhood founded at Maroubra Beach to protect the local youth from frequent incursions by various Sydney gangs seeking to attack surfers
He wears the Bra Boys tattoo proudly along with a range of others including a large necklace tattoo with the signature words My Brothers Keeper Koby showed early potential as a surfer picking up a range of sponsorships before travelling internationally to compete on the World Qualifying Series in the hope of gaining entry onto the premier World Championship Tour
However with the WQS events generally staged in small wave locations he was finding it difficult to register strong results
That all changed when the tour headed to a new destination the little known Teahupoo reef in Tahiti for the 1999 Gotcha Pro
The waves were treacherous with many of the more seasoned competitors fearful of the consequences of the shallow breaking barrels
The 20 year old Koby reveled in the conditions and went on to win the contest and cement his place as a big wave specialist He was later sponsored by international eyewear company Oakley to continue his big wave surfing career
However he regularly courted controversy with his fearsome reputation both in and out of the water resulting in running battles with the law
This was amplified in 2004 when he was charged with accessory after the fact in the murder of a Sydney standover man
His brother Jai had earlier been charged with murder The fallout from the incident coupled with a range of other controversies saw the collapse of his sponsorship and the onset of severe financial hardship
However he toughed it out and was found not guilty on the accessory charge but guilty on the backup charge of perverting the course of justice
He was spared a jail term and vowed to intensify his assault on the worlds biggest waves Kobys exploits in the surf have reportedly earned him more Australian surf magazine covers than any other surfer
He has also picked up a series of new sponsors including Analog clothing Globe International Ltd for shoes and Sabre Vision eyewear to join his long time surfboard sponsor Warner
He also has his own apparel label called My Brothers Keeper

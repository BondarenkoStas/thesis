In San Francisco in 1941 private investigators Sam Spade and Miles Archer meet prospective client Ruth Wonderly
She claims to be looking for her missing sister who is involved with a man named Floyd Thursby whom she is to meet
After receiving a substantial retainer Archer agrees to follow her that night and help get her sister back
That night Spade is awakened by a phone call from the police and informed that Archer has been killed
He meets his friend Police Detective Tom Polhaus at the murder scene
He tries calling Wonderly at her hotel but she has checked out
Back at his apartment he is grilled by Polhaus and Lieutenant Dundy who tell him that Thursby was also murdered the same evening
Dundy suggests that Spade had the opportunity and motive to kill Thursby who likely killed Archer immediately after he learned of Archer s death
Archer s widow Iva believes that Spade shot his partner so he could have her
Later that morning Spade meets Wonderly now calling herself Brigid O Shaughnessy
She explains that Thursby was her partner and probably killed Archer but claims to have no idea who killed Thursby
Spade is not convinced but agrees to investigate the murders
At his office Spade meets Joel Cairo who first offers him 5 000 to find a black figure of a bird then pulls a gun on him in order to search the office
Spade knocks Cairo out and goes through his belongings
When Cairo awakens he hires Spade
Later that evening Spade tells O Shaughnessy about Cairo
When Cairo shows up it becomes clear that Spade s acquaintances know each other
Cairo becomes agitated when O Shaughnessy reveals that the Fat Man is in San Francisco
In the morning Spade goes to Cairo s hotel where he spots Wilmer a young man who had been following him earlier
He gives Wilmer a message for his boss Kasper Gutman the Fat Man
Spade meets Gutman who begins to talk about the Falcon but becomes evasive causing Spade to storm out
Later Wilmer takes Spade at gunpoint to see Gutman
Spade overpowers Wilmer but meets with Gutman anyway
Gutman relates the history of the Maltese Falcon
He offers Spade 25 000 for the bird and a quarter of the proceeds from its sale
Then Spade passes out because his drink had been spiked
Wilmer Gutman and Cairo depart
When Spade awakens he searches the suite and finds a newspaper with the arrival time of the freighter La Paloma circled
He goes to the dock only to find the ship on fire
Later the captain of the ship Jacobi shot several times staggers into Spade s office before dying
The bundle he was clutching contains the Maltese Falcon
O Shaughnessy calls the office giving an address and then screams before the line goes dead
Spade stashes the package at the bus terminal then goes to the address which turns out to be an empty lot
Spade returns home and finds O Shaughnessy hiding in a doorway
He takes her inside and finds Gutman Cairo and Wilmer waiting for him guns drawn
Gutman gives Spade 10 000 for the Falcon but Spade tells them that part of his price is someone he can turn over to the police for the murders of Thursby and Captain Jacobi
Spade suggests Wilmer since he certainly killed Thursby and Jacobi
After some intense negotiation Gutman and Cairo agree Wilmer is knocked out in a scuffle
Just after dawn Spade calls his secretary Effie Perine to bring him the bundle
However when Gutman inspects the black statuette he finds it is a fake
During the tumult Wilmer flees
Recovering from his frustration Gutman invites Cairo to return with him to Istanbul to continue their quest
After they leave Spade calls the police and tells them where to pick up the pair
Spade then angrily confronts O Shaughnessy telling her he knows she killed Archer to implicate Thursby her unwanted accomplice
She confesses but begs Spade to not turn her over to the police
Despite his feelings for her Spade gives O Shaughnessy up

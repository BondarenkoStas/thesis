Major Vic Deakins and Captain Riley Hale pilots in the United States Air Force are assigned to a top secret exercise over Utah flying a B 3 Stealth Bomber with two B83 nuclear bombs on board
After successfully evading Air Force radar Deakins attacks Hale and ejects him out of the plane
Deakins then releases the bombs without detonating them and reports that Hale has gone rogue
He then ejects from the plane leaving it to crash
A search and rescue team is sent to recover the warheads
They do not find the warheads and report a Broken Arrow a situation wherein nuclear weapons are missing
The team later locates the warheads in a canyon but are killed by mercenaries including Sgt
Kelly a corrupt member of the team
Deakins arrives moments later and plots his next move with Pritchett the operation s financier
They plan to blackmail the US government with the threat of detonating the warhead in a populated area
Hale survives the ejection and is found by park ranger Terry Carmichael
He convinces her to help him track down Deakins
After recovering the warheads and escaping to a nearby copper mine Hale attempts to disable them by intentionally entering the arming code incorrectly
However as Deakins had rigged the device Hale s actions instead arm the warhead
He hides the remaining one deep in an abandoned mine
Deakins team arrive and secure the unarmed warhead
Deakins then shortens the detonation time and leaves Hale and Terry to die
A NEST team helicopter chases Deakins team
During the chase Deakins kills Pritchett after he becomes fed up with the latter s complaints
Hale and Terry escape from the mine via an underground river just before the bomb detonates
The bomb s EMP destroys the NEST helicopter allowing Deakins to escape
Terry and Hale track him to a motorboat used for transporting the warhead
While trying to steal the boat Terry is forced to hide onboard while Deakins moves the warhead
Military forces rescue Hale
Hale deduces that Deakins intends to use a train to transport the warhead
Travelling on helicopter with Colonel Wilkins Hale infiltrates the train and finds Terry
A gunfight ensues and the helicopter is destroyed Wilkins and most of Deakins mercenaries are killed
With his own helicopter sabotaged by Hale and his plan falling apart Deakins decides to detonate the warhead regardless
Not wanting to die Kelly holds Deakins at gunpoint and orders him to disarm the weapon
Hale takes advantage of the situation and kicks Kelly out of the train to his death
Terry detaches the rear section of the train from the front but gets into a shootout with the engineer
The latter is shot and falls on the train brakes causing the train to stop
The detached boxcars continue to coast at high speed
Meanwhile Deakins still in possession of a device that can either disarm or detonate the bomb forces Hale to drop his gun and challenges him to close quarters combat
Hale eventually overpowers Deakins acquires the detonator disarms the warhead and leaps out of the train
As the detached boxcars slam into the halted front half the warhead flies into Deakins and the entire train derails and explodes incinerating him
Hale finds Terry and the damaged nuclear warhead
The two formally introduce themselves to each other amidst the wreckage

One member of Hunter s new hand picked team is Helen Marshall his former adulterous lover
The two cases massacre and serial killings are linked by Officer Bob Craven who behaves in an openly hostile manner to the new team
Hunter correctly deduces that the Ripper inquiry is being side tracked by the Wearside Jack tapes and feels that the real Ripper has been interviewed and missed
Hunter suspects that one of the Ripper s supposed victims Clare Strachan was not actually a Ripper victim
Hunter receives information on the murder from B J who is introduced through Reverend Laws
B J
claims that Strachan was a prostitute working for Eric Hall a now dead WYC policeman
Hall s wife requests that Hunter meet her and after visiting her house where Reverend Laws is also present she provides Hunter with proof of Hall s work as a pimp and pornographer and that she gave Hall s documents to Jobson
Jobson claims to have lost the files
Meanwhile the former affair between Hunter and Marshall threatens to reignite
Hunter interrogates Inspectors Dickie Alderman and Jim Prentice who lets slip that the Strachan murder was probably performed by Hall covered up to look like a Ripper murder
Hunter also visits the now debilitated Tommy Douglas who later phones him demanding that they meet at his house

Red Riding 1983 Director Anand Tucker Technique taped with a Red One digital camera Run time 1 hour 45 minutes Rating 2 05m In 1983 Detective Inspector Maurice Jobson is plagued by guilt over his reluctant participation in the corrupt activities within the WYC
It is revealed that it was he who tipped off Dunford about the arson in the Roma camp near Hunslet in which Jobson took part under pressure by Molloy
It is also revealed that the camp site had to be vacated to pursue a 100M joint investment between Dawson and the top echelons of the WYC on a project for a commercial center
It is also revealed that he knew about the innocence of Michael Myshkin a mentally retarded man who was accused of the serial killings in 1974
Jobson is aware of a conspiracy within the WYC protecting high profile figures including Dawson from public exposure
Jobson s pangs of conscience are brought upon by his investigation into the recent disappearance of a young girl named Hazel Atkins and lead him to open previous cases
He also starts an intimate relationship with a medium who seems to be in possession of valuable information concerning the more recent crimes
Meanwhile John Piggott a solicitor and the son of a notorious WYC officer decides to explore the Atkins case himself
His inquiries lead him to Leonard Cole the young man who found the swan stitched victim in 1974 and who is now being framed for Atkins disappearance
Cole is tortured and murdered by the police his death disguised as a suicide
Using information given by Myshkin Piggott finds a mine shaft hidden in a pigeon shed near Laws home where it is revealed that a paedophile and child murdering ring was run in West Yorkshire by Reverend Laws and that clients of this ring included significant figures of society among them businessmen such as Dawson and policemen such as Piggott s own father
It is implied that only when children with known stable local families were abducted did the criminal structure run the risk of being made public
This was the main reason for the constables indirect assistance in Dawson s demise thereby solving the two little problems referred to by Angus at the same time without compromising their million pound investment on the commercial center
It is clear that at least after 1974 Laws counted on the complicity and even direct collaboration of high ranking officials in the WYC although the extent of his grip on the police the reasons why he did not share a fate similar to Dawson s and the degree of knowledge WYC brass had of his and Dawson s activities prior to 1974 are left open to speculation
Finally it is also revealed that B J
was the first child abducted by this criminal enterprise and perhaps the only one who survived
He ends up returning to Laws home to enact revenge but in the last moment finds himself unable to do so due to Laws mind numbing domineering influence on him
Seconds before Laws is about to drill into B J
s head with an electrical drill Jobson appears with a shotgun and shoots the reverend three times killing him
He then opens the hidden entrance to the mine shaft just in time for Piggott to emerge from it with a still living Hazel Atkins in his arms
B J
flees southward by train reflecting on his upbringing his experiences and his escape from the past of West Yorkshire
Thus three characters Jobson Piggott and B J
achieve some measure of redemption in the end

In Hong Kong Chief Hong challenges his rival Yuan Zeng for the title of martial arts master
Their students face off against each other and when his students are easily defeated Hong calls in a samurai to fight on his behalf
Zeng s students are initially dismissive of a Japanese martial artist but he defeats his opponent whom he goads into committing suicide
Zeng s student Liang Zhi Sheng defeats the samurai but before the samurai commits suicide he warns that an allied ninja clan will seek revenge for his death
He tosses his ring at Zeng who is poisoned when he catches it
As Zeng recuperates he receives a challenge from the Five Element Ninjas
Suspecting a trap he keeps two of his best students Sheng and Tian Hao at the school to guard it against an invasion and sends ten others to do battle
As Sheng and Hao help to reinforce the school s defenses and set traps the ninjas use trickery and guerrilla warfare to defeat their opponents
Hong is overjoyed but the leader of the ninja Cheng Yun Mudou advises that they push their advantage to destroy Zeng s school
Hong agrees and Mudou sends a female spy Senji to infiltrate the school
Sheng convinces a reluctant Hao to take her in after they save her from being beaten
Senji secretly makes a map as she takes various jobs around the school
Distrustful of her Hao accuses her of hiding his weapon when she cleans his bedroom and demands to taste test the soup that she has poisoned before letting her serve it to Zeng to maintain her cover she intentionally drops it
Once Senji completes her map she smuggles it to Mudou
That night Senji offers herself to Sheng who refuses to take advantage of her though he agrees that she may play a song for him on her flute
Under the cover of her flute playing Mudou s ninja attack the camp killing many of the students before they are aware of the assault
Senji reveals herself as a spy and mortally wounds Sheng before he can rush to Hao s aid
Mudou kills Sheng and Zeng Hao who Senji requests they take prisoner is the only survivor
Remembering basic ninja training that he received in the past Hao escapes from his bonds and takes Senji hostage when she comes to tell him that she has fallen in love with him
Hao escapes the ninja and returns to his old ninja master to complete his training
He joins three other students who help him in his quest for revenge
Meanwhile Mudou kills Hong and takes his place as martial arts master
Hao delivers a challenge to Mudou who sends Senji to spy on Hao and report who his new master is he also sends four ninjas to spy on Senji herself
Hao easily detects her but when he also sees the ninjas he accuses Senji of trying to trap him and kills her
After killing the ninjas Hao and his fellow martial arts students proceed to fight each of the Five Element Ninjas
Now well trained in ninjutsu and aware of the ninjas trickery Hao and his fellow martial arts students easily defeat the Japanese ninjas
Mudou however proves to be a difficult foe
As the four Chinese ninjas face off against him he sneaks leg shackles onto Hao
Hao uses a mysterious key his master gave to him to unlock them and makes many unsuccessful attempts to put them on Mudou
Finally channeling his rage over the deaths of Senji Sheng and Zeng he shackles Mudou s legs and pulls him down while his 3 fellow martial arts students speared Mudou
Hao himself is mortally wounded in the process
As his fellow martial arts students enquired as to why he put himself in front of Muduo s spiked feet he dies

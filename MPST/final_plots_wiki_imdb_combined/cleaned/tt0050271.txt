Kathy Ferguson is a San Francisco newspaper advice columnist
One day Lieutenant Bill Doyle a Los Angeles police detective and his partner Captain Charlie Alidos track a fugitive wanted for murder to San Francisco
He meets Kathy and they fall in love
She manages to gain the female fugitive s trust and locate her
Kathy s resulting front page story leads to an offer of a big job in New York City but she abandons her career marries Doyle and moves to Los Angeles
Her new role as a 1950s suburban wife and homemaker quickly makes her unhappy
She wants her husband to move up in the world to become somebody
Doyle has different values
He works in order to afford a comfortable lifestyle no more
Kathy schemes to push her husband up the career ladder without his knowledge
She arranges to get into a car accident with Alice Pope in order to become acquainted with her husband Police Inspector Tony Pope head of Bill s division
Pope realizes what she has done and why but plays along
Her continuing ploys inevitably bring her into conflict with Sara Alidos the captain s equally ambitious wife and Captain Alidos begins to find fault with Bill at every opportunity
Vicious rumors circulate about Kathy s relationship with Tony Pope
When Bill sees a poison pen letter that Kathy has received he rushes to work and punches his boss Alidos in front of two police witnesses
During the investigation Pope shifts enough of the blame to Alidos suggesting he reached for his gun when the visibly angry Bill burst into the room that he can hush up the whole incident
Alidos is then transferred to another division and Bill is given his former position as an acting homicide captain
When Alice Pope breaks down under the years of mental strain of being a policeman s wife and is hospitalized Tony decides to retire
When Tony comes to tell Kathy about Alice s breakdown and his plans to retire Kathy tries to persuade him to recommend her husband for the vacancy his departure will create
During their talk he seems to consider the idea favorably then grabs and kisses her
She recoils at first then embraces him
Afterward however he avoids her
When she finally forces him to meet her he makes it clear that he believes that Bill is not qualified and that he is going to recommend Charlie Alidos as his successor
This elevation of a man she hates over her husband s ambition infuriates Kathy
When Kathy accompanies Bill to the police station she steals a gun used in a robbery and murder that her husband is investigating
Kathy then confronts Pope in his home and pleads that he at least not recommend Charlie Alidos
If Pope recommends no one Kathy argues her husband still has a small chance and she can justify what she did
Pope coldly refuses so she shoots him dead
The entire police department works on Pope s murder investigation
Bill figures out the killer has to have been his own wife
When Bill confronts Kathy she tells him Now I ll know just how much of a cop you really are
Bill responds The same cop Kathy
The same cop you met in Frisco
Same cop I was 10 years ago pounding a beat
The same cop
He then drives her to police headquarters
Inside before they disappear behind a door she nods her head

A Woman Warrior returns home
A Boy struggles to become a Man
Two destinies entertwine
The Master will give the final lesson
And the entire town will be changed by The Sensei
You have a right to defend yourself against hatred The story centers around McClain a homosexual teenager who recently lost his lover to a lynch mob in a small rural town in Colorado
Afraid for his life he frequently tries to enlist in martial arts classes at a local dojo only to have his applications mysteriously vanish
To further matters the local minister turns the sermon at an Easter mass from the passion and resurrection of Christ to matters of Sodom and Gomorrah at the very sight of McClain and his mother entering the church to join in the ceremony
In the dojo s defense they turn young McClain away not directly because of his sexual orientation but because they fear losing their students over the matter
In fact the family that runs the dojo has had some acceptance issues of their own to deal with not just because of being Asian but actually because of being multi ethnic with Irish Asian and even Filipino members and relatives
They re also of mixed faiths with the grandparents devout Buddhists and one of their sons a Christian actively involved with the local church
The family has a very proud tradition of teaching the martial arts throughout the generations a tradition that sadly is not open to the women of the family as we learn when we are introduced to Karen O Neil a black sheep of the family who returns to town to settle a small matter which is revealed later on in the film
McClain is cornered in the locker room after gym class and savagely beaten by the school bully recently suspended from the football team
Desperate McClain s mother approaches Karen and asks him to teach her son some fighting moves in the hope he might have a fighting chance at defending himself
Karen is reluctant at first but agrees to private lessons wherein she forms a strong and lasting bond with McClain
The lessons are put to the test when a fight breaks out in the school cafeteria instigated by the bully
McClain is able to subdue the attack only to earn the scorn of the bully s older brother who blames McClain for his brother s now repeated incarceration
Things go south for Karen when her family finds out she s been teaching McClain with her older brother the most disapproving and she considers leaving town
McClain is devastated by her decision and his attempts to outrun the pain sets him in the sights of the bully s intoxicated brother and his motley crew of hicks and hillbillies
Karen manages to come to the rescue in time and the two just barely manage to hold their own against the brutes
As a result everyone is hospitalized but a small misunderstanding about bleeding wounds drives a wedge between McClain and Karen leading him to think she s just as homophobic as everyone else
Karen s family arrives and Karen reveals the reason she came back has to do with her husband s death
She tells McClain that her husband a boxer she d previously said died of cancer in reality had AIDS and passed it on to her
What follows is how all these revelations are reconciled by the families friends and community at large

During the Mexican American War Second Lieutenant Boyd who is fighting in the United States Army finds his courage fail him in battle so he plays dead as his unit is massacred
His body along with the other dead are put in a cart and hauled back to the Mexican headquarters
However in a moment of bravery Boyd seizes the chance to capture the Mexican HQ
His heroism earns him a Captain s promotion but when General Slauson learns of the cowardice through which victory was achieved he posts Boyd into exile at Fort Spencer a remote military outpost high in the Sierra Nevadas
Shortly after Boyd joins the seven man garrison at Fort Spencer a stranger named Colqhoun arrives and describes how his wagon train became lost in the mountains
A Colonel Ives had promised the party a shorter route to the Pacific Ocean but instead had led them on a more circuitous route resulting in the party getting trapped by snow
People were reduced to cannibalism to avoid starvation
A rescue party is assembled to search for survivors
But before they leave they are warned by their Native American scout George of the Wendigo myth anyone who consumes the flesh of their enemies takes their strength but becomes a demon cursed by an insatiable hunger for more human flesh
When the soldiers reach the cave where the party had taken refuge they come to realize that Colqhoun and Ives are one and the same
He had killed and eaten his five companions and is now set on trapping and killing them as well
Colqhoun succeeds in doing this one by one including Colonel Hart the fort s commanding officer
Boyd manages to escape the massacre by jumping off a cliff but breaks his leg in the process
He hides in a pit next to the body of a fellow soldier
Eventually he eats some of the man s flesh to stay alive
When he finally limps back into the fort he is delirious and severely traumatized none of the remaining soldiers believe his wild tale
A second expedition finds no bodies or any trace of the man
A temporary commander is assigned to the fort and to Boyd s horror it turns out to be Colqhoun now cleaned up and calling himself Colonel Ives
The others still refuse to believe that Ives is the killer especially after he bears no sign of the wounds inflicted on him during the fight at the cave
Ives tells Boyd that he used to suffer from tuberculosis but when a Native scout told him the Wendigo myth he just had to try by murdering him eating his flesh and in the process curing his illness
He now planned to use the fort as a base to do the same to other passing travellers he compares the location of the fort with the guaranteed supply of isolated migrants that it entails to the notion of Manifest Destiny that draws them there
Boyd is suspected of murder after another soldier mysteriously dies chained up he watches helplessly as the last officer is murdered by an unexpected ally of Ives Colonel Hart back from the dead after the massacre
Ives saved Hart by feeding him his own comrades and now Hart is addicted like Colqhoun to human flesh
Ives wounds Boyd and forces him to make a choice eat or die
Eventually Boyd gives in and eats a stew made out of the last officer killed and his wound heals
But rather than join the two men in their conspiracy to convert General Slauson who is due to arrive at the fort shortly Boyd convinces Hart to free him so he can kill Ives
Hart does so but asks that he be killed because he no longer wants to live as a cannibal
Boyd and Ives inflict grievous wounds on each other
But they don t die easily due to their recuperative powers
Finally in an outhouse Boyd forces Ives into a large bear trap and springs it pinning them both together
Ives taunts Boyd by telling him he ll eat him as soon as he dies but Ives expires first
General Slauson arrives and while his aide looks around the dilapidated fort the general tastes the stew that was left simmering on the fire
Martha the sister of George the native scout sees Ives and the dying Boyd in the outhouse closes the door and walks away

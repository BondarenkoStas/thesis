Many Seinfeld episodes are based on the writers real life experiences with the experiences re interpreted for the characters storyline
For example George s storyline The Revenge is based on Larry David s experience at Saturday Night Live
The Contest is also based on David s experiences
The Smelly Car storyline is based on Peter Mehlman s lawyer friend who could not get a bad smell out of his car
The Strike is based on Dan O Keefe s dad who made up his own holiday Festivus
Other stories take on a variety of turns
The Chinese Restaurant consists of George Jerry and Elaine waiting for a table throughout the entire episode
The Boyfriend revolving around Keith Hernandez extends through 2 episodes
The Betrayal is famous for using reverse chronology and was inspired by a similar plot device in a Harold Pinter play Betrayal
Some stories were inspired by headlines and rumors as explained in the DVD features Notes About Nothing Inside Look and Audio Commentary
In The Maestro Kramer s lawsuit is roughly similar to the McDonald s coffee case
The Outing is based primarily on rumors that Larry Charles heard about Jerry Seinfeld s sexuality
Themes Seinfeld broke several conventions of mainstream television with the series often being described as a show about nothing
However Seinfeld in 2014 stated the pitch for the show the real pitch when Larry and I went to NBC in 1988 was we want to show how a comedian gets his material
The show about nothing was just a joke in an episode many years later and Larry and I to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show because to us it s the opposite of that
It became the first TV series since Monty Python s Flying Circus to be widely described as postmodern
Several elements of Seinfeld fit in with a postmodern interpretation
The show is typically driven by humor interspersed with superficial conflict and characters with peculiar dispositions
Many episodes revolved around the characters involvement in the lives of others with typically disastrous results
On the set the notion that the characters should not develop or improve throughout the series was expressed as the no hugging no learning rule
Unlike most sitcoms there are no moments of pathos the audience is never made to feel sorry for any of the characters
Even Susan s death elicits no genuine emotions from anybody in the show
The characters are thirty something singles with vague identities no roots and conscious indifference to morals
Usual conventions like isolating the characters from the actors playing them and separating the characters world from that of the actors and audience were broken
One such example is the story arc where the characters promote a TV sitcom series named Jerry
The show within a show Jerry was much like Seinfeld in that it was about nothing and Seinfeld played himself
The fictional Jerry was launched in the season four finale but unlike Seinfeld it wasn t picked up as a series
Jerry is one of many examples of metafiction in the show
There are no fewer than twenty two fictional movies featured like Rochelle Rochelle
Catchphrases Many terms were coined popularized or re popularized in the series run and have become part of popular culture
Notable catchphrases and terms include Yada yada yada No soup for you
These pretzels are making me thirsty Not that there s anything wrong with that
Festivus spongeworthy double dipping re gifter The lexicon of Seinfeldian code words and recurring phrases that evolved around particular episodes is referred to as Seinlanguage the title of Jerry Seinfeld s best selling book on humor
Music A signature of Seinfeld is its theme music
Composed by Jonathan Wolff it consists of distinct solo sampled bass synthesizer riffs which open the show and connect the scenes often accompanied by beatboxing
The bass synthesizer music eventually replaced the original music by Jep Epstein when it was played again after the first broadcast The Seinfeld Chronicles
The show lacked a traditional title track and the riffs were played over the first moments of dialogue or action
They vary throughout each episode and are played in an improvised funk style
An additional musical theme with an ensemble led by a synthesized mid range brass instrument ends each episode
In The Note the first episode of season three the bumper music featured a scatting female jazz singer who sang a phrase that sounded like easy to beat
Jerry Seinfeld and executive producer Larry David both liked Wolff s additions and three episodes were produced with this new style music
However they had neglected to inform NBC and Castle Rock executives of the change and when the season premiere aired the executives were surprised and unimpressed and requested that they return to the original style
The subsequent two episodes were redone leaving this episode as the only one with additional music elements
In the commentary of The Note Louis Dreyfus facetiously suggests it was removed because the perceived lyric related closely to the low ratings at the time
In the final three seasons the bits were tweaked slightly with more frantic rhythms a bass guitar was added in addition to the sampled bass from earlier seasons
Throughout the show the main theme could be re styled in different ways depending on the episode
For instance in The Betrayal part of which takes place in India the theme is heard played on a sitar

If French political thriller Secrets of State were any more topical it would be about what you ate for breakfast
This fast paced and meticulously researched tale shows the recruitment and training of a young female Secret Service operative alongside a parallel story about how an unlikely but deadly young male terrorist is created
Each is skilfully manipulated for a cause This carefully layered mostly plausible tale boasts several suspenseful set pieces
Although it requires near exhausting concentration to absorb its heady mix of information and high stakes activity Secrets of State should appeal to audiences who liked the tone and content of The Interpreter The Manchurian Candidate remake or Syriana and would enjoy a Euro take on the same theme Al Barad a Westernised terrorist posing as a businessman twists Islamic tenets for political ends
Wine broker Alex is a high ranking counter terrorism specialist bending or ignoring the law to thwart his opponents and keep France secure Both sides are playing a deadly game of chess that regularly requires new human playing pieces a suicide bomber here a sexy decoy there
Attractive young Diane who dabbled as a high priced call girl prior to pursuing a degree in Arabic is artfully recruited by Alex almost before she knows what hit her Training exercises how to give adversaries the slip resist interrogation etc
convince us that the External Security academy is a pretty cool school and being a secret agent an exciting lifestyle
Diane s assignment to seduce Al Barad on his home turf may make her feel more alive but could easily lead to her death Meanwhile petty drug dealer Pierre is arrested and sent to prison
As the handsome white lad is emotionally and physically vulnerable he s ripe for the picking
Under fellow inmate Aziz s manipulative guidance Pierre converts to Islam convinced he s found a caring surrogate family
Upon release he attends terrorist boot camp preparing to serve his handlers on an eventual mission Two complex Arab characters smart brave field operative Leila and intelligence officer Ahmed a practicing Muslim whose allegiance to France is horrifically tested are a fine departure from movie stereotypes
Beyond their inherent importance to the script Leila and Ahmed are a good example for other screenwriters striving to be politically savvy without being politically correct A passage in which various specialists played by the film s seven eminent real life consultants weigh in on a coded threat gives viewers a taste of the crucial decisions constantly being made based on a combination of educated guesses and hard won research
Little in co screenwriter director Philippe Haim s previous work pointed to such a serious and ambitious theme but he s definitely up to the task
Two thirds of the sharply edited film are hand held creating immediacy and sweeping momentum Although it s not hard to tell the good guys from the bad there are plenty of grey areas in their all too convincing motivations
Both sides use sophisticated indoctrination techniques and ideology aside terrorists and secret agents seem to have a lot in common Morocco stands in credibly here for Syria Afghanistan Lebanon and Jordan

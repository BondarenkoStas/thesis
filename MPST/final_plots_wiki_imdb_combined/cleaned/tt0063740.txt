The brothers ride to Maria s home to find her burying her husband give her a third share of the stolen money and suggest that they leave for Mexico
Driven by revenge Maria take the money to a ghost town surrounded by dunes where she meets its lone inhabitant Manuel
A gunfighter with a fetishistic habit of wearing a black leather glove in duels Manuel had once shared a polyamorous relationship with Maria and Ben but he left the pair to marry in order to suppress his violent nature
Maria asks him to avenge Ben on her behalf although reluctant and sceptical Manuel accepts her offer
Manuel rides to a nearby town and stays at a hotel that Will s sons frequent
In the local saloon vigilantes from the rival Vallee family confront and attack the Rogers brothers in an attempt to run them out of town
Manuel kills the Vallees and is quickly arrested
The next morning the Rogers brothers bribe the sheriff into releasing Manuel and take him to their family s ranch
Thankful for saving his sons Will provides Manuel a job as the ranch s foreman
That night Manuel dines with the Rogers and their ranch hands during which he opens a jar of mustard to find a jack in the box resulting in both dinner tables erupting with laughter as they accept him as their friend
Later Manuel opens the ranch s corral and frees the horses during the commotion as the Rogers try to pursue their mounts he kidnaps Diana Will s teenage daughter and takes her to the ghost town
To ensure that they exact their ultimate revenge on the Rogers Thomas and Eli rape Diana while Maria and Manuel growing increasingly impassioned and uncomfortable with the situation that is transpiring wait outside in the street

The year is 1883
Clay a gunfighter with health problems is interned in Drunner Labor Camp
He s determined to prove his innocence since he was framed by Fox the current Sheriff of Clay s former home of Mesa Encantada
Fox has subsequently been hired by the townspeople to protect them from Ortiz and his bandits
Instead Fox now runs a protection racket extorting and terrorizing the complacent citizens threatening them with violence if they do not pay exorbitant taxes to him
Clay rides out to meet Ortiz who tries to hire him to kill Fox
Ortiz s mistress Estella whom Clay saved earlier from an attack by Fox s men lets Clay escape the Ortiz encampment
She tells him Clay stole gold from him prompting Ortiz and his gang to seek out Clay
This enables Fox to ambush both of them
Fox kills Ortiz and captures Clay
She helps Clay escape and despite losing his sight manages to decimate Fox s gang one by one
Realizing he is unable to see clearly Fox seeks him out in one of the town s stables and tries to lure him into shooting his own daughter Nancy during the final showdown
Various VHS and DVD versions end with Clay lying apparently dead in the street with Nancy at his side
This more pessimistic ending is in the style of Corbucci s later masterpieces Django and The Great Silence
But in the Italian version there is an afterword in which the Cavalry having presumably dealt with any surviving malefactors ride off and Clay now wearing glasses bids goodbye to Nancy and her beau
He then rides off
Corbucci lets Clay reach the horizon then cuts to a medium shot of Clay taking off his glasses throwing them in the air and shooting holes in both lenses
His sight miraculously has been completely restored

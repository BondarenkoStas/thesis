In the 9th century in the north of Britain a Druid circle foresees a falling star from the constellation Draco with Brude one of the druids summoning a Pict clan known as the Painted tribe to slaughter the druids and lead the clans to war against the southern kingdoms over Hadrian s Wall
A druid apprentice called Lorne escapes the slaughter of the druids
On the Southern side of the wall Gareth and a group of squires undergo their final tests to prove that they should be knighted
Gareth proves to be the best fighter but fails to collect enough money from the peasants
Disappointed his superior Sir Horsa refuses to knight him and tells Gareth that he owes him 100 crowns after which Gareth will be given his knighthood
With nowhere to go Gareth is taken in by a peasant couple who couldn t pay him
That night a meteor falls to Earth on the North side of the wall with Gareth stealing a sword from one of the knighted squires and going over the wall to find the meteor after been told by the couple that it would contain riches
Eventually Gareth finds the meteor only for it to burst open and reveal a dragon with nine eggs
The dragon proceeds to attack the Painted tribe members that also tracked down the meteor with Gareth saving one of the dragon s eggs despite been badly wounded by the clan warriors
Impressed by Gareth s mercy the dragon shares its heart with him saving Gareth s life
However Brude uses a slavery spell called the Sorcerer s Curse on the dragon rendering the creature powerless during daylight or by the light of a flame and meaning the dragon will be under Brude s control by the full moon before claiming the dragon eggs
Gareth is rescued by Lorne who explains to Gareth about dragons and the bond he now shares with the dragon before Gareth is introduced to Rhonu and the clans who oppose Brude with the hope Gareth will get the dragon to fight for them
Meeting the dragon again the dragon explains his purpose to raise the young dragons he has brought as friends to mankind
However he also states that he needs help to retrieve the eggs as he cannot do it himself due to the curse
Gareth s first attempt fails with him getting captured by the clan
Brude intends to kill him but stops upon learning about Gareth s connection with Drago
With help from Rhonu and Lorne he successfully escapes with the eggs
Gareth convinces the group to head towards the wall with Rhonu telling her uncle Traevor to gather the clans who oppose Brude
Travelling with Rhonu and Lorne the trio are forced to go on foot after one of the eggs is accidentally destroyed
Along their journey Drago tries to teach Gareth how to shadow jump although apparently fails
However while trying to free a group of people captured by the painted clan Gareth shows an act of valour temporarily freeing Drago from the curse
The trio escape from Brude and the clan after Gareth sacrifices one of the dragon eggs and shadow jumps to safety
Before the group reach the wall Gareth confesses to Drago that he isn t a knight and that the Southern side of the wall is a cruel place with no respect for the Old Code of King Arthur although Drago still sees Gareth as a friend
Upon reaching the gate Gareth Lorne and Rhonu are arrested and the dragon eggs seized upon learning of the Painted clan heading towards the wall
At the full moon Drago and the Painted tribe attack although Gareth and Rhonu escape with help from Lorne s magic
As Gareth interrupts the sale of the dragon eggs and battles Sir Horsa to protect them his act of valour frees Drago who aids both the soldiers and the northern clans led by Traevor
Gareth slays Sir Horsa while Rhonu battles and kills Brude although is fatally wounded herself
With Brude dead and Drago free the remainder of the Painted tribe retreats
Following the battle Gareth tends to Rhonu who is saved as one of the unhatched dragons shares its heart with her
Gareth becomes a knight and leader of the settlement with peace achieved between the North and South as Hadrian s Wall is renamed the Dragon s Gate
Gareth and Rhonu finally express their love for each other as the baby dragon that saved Rhonu begins to hatch

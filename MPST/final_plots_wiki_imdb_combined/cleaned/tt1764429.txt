Following the end of World War II Cole Phelps a decorated USMC veteran of the Pacific Campaign returns to Los Angeles California to live with his family while taking on work as a Patrol Officer of the LAPD
In 1947 working with his partner Officer Ralph Dunn Phelps successfully solves a major murder case and impresses his superiors who promote him to detective
Working alongside Stefan Bekowsky in Traffic and then Finbarr Rusty Galloway in Homicide Phelps earns a reputation for solving difficult cases that eventually land him a promotion into Vice
During this time he begins falling for German lounge singer Elsa Lichtmann and soon has an affair with her
Unknown to him Roy Earle his partner in Vice and a corrupt cop uses this information to help several prominent figures in the city including the Chief of Police cover up a major scandal by making him a media scapegoat in exchange for a place in a syndicate known as the Suburban Redevelopment Fund a development program that supplies homes for homecoming WWII veterans
When his adultery is exposed Phelps becomes disgraced in the LAPD while his wife ends their marriage
Prior to his demotion to Arson Phelps had found that several Marines of his former unit had been selling morphine syrettes stolen from the ship that had taken them home the SS Coolridge which had later led to most being assassinated by mobsters working for Mickey Cohen who controlled the drug trade and had resented the competition most of the stolen drugs remains unaccounted for by the time he is demoted
While investigating a pair of suspicious house fires with his partner in Arson Herschel Biggs Phelps notes a connection between them and a recent housing development known as Elysian Fields but is warned by Earle to back off from tycoon developer Leland Monroe
Seeking help to investigate the development Phelps advises Elsa to refuse a life insurance payout in order to prompt his old comrade Jack Kelso now an investigator for the California Fire Life insurance company to look into the matter
Kelso quickly discovers that the development is using unsuitable building materials and becomes an investigator for the Assistant D A
whereupon he soon learns that Monroe and his former employer the owner of Fire Life are involved in the SRF syndicate
Kelso and Phelps eventually learn from their investigations that the Fund is merely a front to conceal its true purpose to defraud the US Federal Government
Run by several local businessmen dignitaries as well as Monroe and the Chief of Police the syndicate had learnt about the proposed route for the Whitnall Parkway through the Wilshire district of the city and thus bought the land it would run through
Monroe then built communities of matchstick houses while Fire Life falsely claimed the land was a higher value knowing that the government would pay whatever the land was worth in order to gain eminent domain over it
Further investigations reveals that Courtney Sheldon a headstrong corpsman of Phelps and Kelso s former unit had been involved in the theft of the morphine
The remainder of the morphine had been given to Sheldon s mentor and pop psychiatrist Harlan Fontaine who sold it on to finance the Fund and murdered Sheldon after he began questioning the syndicate s plans
Following a shoot out at Monroe s mansion Kelso discovers that the SRF had used Ira Hogeboom a former flamethrower operator from Phelps and Kelso s unit to help them with their plans
Hogeboom suffering from PTSD and schizophrenia after inadvertently killing a large number of civilians on Phelps orders during the Battle of Okinawa had been unknowingly manipulated by Fontaine to torch the houses of holdouts who refused to sell out to the SRF until eventually going insane after he inadvertently incinerates a house with an entire family inside
After learning that Hogeboom had murdered Fontaine and kidnapped Elsa Phelps and Kelso pursue him into the Los Angeles River Tunnels as a heavy rain begins fighting their way through corrupt policemen and thugs
The pair rescue Elsa with Kelso killing Hogeboom to put him out of his mental anguish
With the water level rising the group use an open manhole to escape but Phelps is swept away in the current
Whilst the SRF scam is exposed several members escape justice to attend Phelps s funeral each delivering eulogies to his memory much to the disgust of Elsa
Biggs remarks to Kelso that Phelps was never his friend to which Kelso agrees but responds that he was never Phelps enemy
An epilogue flashback scene soon reveals that Kelso had known about the stolen morphine and Sheldon s involvement after they and their other fellow Marines found the surplus supply on their ship home
However Kelso refused to be involved in Sheldon s scheme to sell the drugs along with the other Marines telling them all that they will lose his respect for them as Marines if they go through with the drug profiting setting in motion the events of the game

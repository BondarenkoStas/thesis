Throughout the game the Exile restores their connection to the Force while with the help of non playable companions setting out to stop the Sith

Two planets featured in the original game Korriban and Dantooine are revisited both with ravaged buildings and intensified problems
The Ebon Hawk the main character s ship in the first game is also the player s transportation in Knights of the Old Republic II
Characters The Exile s back story reveals that the character served under Revan during the Mandalorian Wars and ordered the activation of a devastating weapon in the climactic battle over Malachor V The deaths that ensued created such a substantial wound in the Force that the character was forced to sever their connection to the Force to survive and the Jedi Council ordered the character exiled from the Jedi Order
As the game progresses the Jedi Exile rebuilds a connection to the Force and creates unusually strong Force Bonds with other characters and places while unknowingly sapping Force powers
Among the characters who join the Jedi Exile are Kreia who acts as the Exile s mentor pilot and former Sith assassin Atton Rand technician and Mandalorian War veteran Bao Dur and his droid remote the criminal droid G0 T0 and the Sith apprentice Visas Marr
T3 M4 and Canderous Ordo both featured in the first game also join the Exile s team
Other characters join the Exile s party under certain conditions

Depending on the player s alignment the Exile will either be joined by the bounty hunter Mira or by her rival a Wookiee bounty hunter known as Hanharr
Depending on the player s gender the Exile will either be joined by Mical the Disciple or Brianna the Handmaiden
The game features three main antagonists Darth Traya a mysterious assailant who remains in the dark through most of the game Darth Sion an undead Sith Lord with a murderous hatred for Jedi and Darth Nihilus a Sith Lord whose physical being was destroyed due to his immense affinity to the Force
Plot While hiding on the Harbinger a Republic cruiser the Exile is sedated by HK 50 an assassin droid to be delivered to a crime syndicate called the Exchange who have put out a bounty on live Jedi
The Exile is rescued by Kreia with whom they form a Force Bond and the droid T3 M4 on the Ebon Hawk and the three flee the Harbinger as it is hijacked by a squad of Sith assassins
However their ship is damaged during escape by the Harbinger s gunfire and they eventually arrive at the Peragus Mining Facility
Teaming up with smuggler Atton Rand the group escapes to the planet Telos IV
While hiding out on Telos they encounter Atris a surviving member of the Jedi Council who sentenced the protagonist to exile ten years prior
After settling a dispute regarding the Exile s past sentence Atris forms an uneasy alliance with them instructing them to seek out other surviving Jedi in order to rally against the Sith
The Exile then travels to four worlds to find reclusive Jedi Masters and either begs their aid or kills them in revenge for being exiled depending on player choice
As the Exile continues their journey they are joined by several individuals in their quest
After finding all the Masters the Exile travels back to Dantooine and learns that the countless deaths at Malachor V resulted in the Exile unconsciously giving up connection to the Force which then became the teachings of the new Sith
If the player aided the Jedi Masters they prepare to strip the Exile of their Force connection permanently as the Masters fear that these teachings could result in the actual death of the Force but Kreia reveals herself to be the former leader of the Sith and murders them all in retribution
If the player killed the Jedi Masters Kreia attacks the Exile and leaves
Tracking Kreia to Telos the Exile fights and defeats a corrupted Atris from whom it is learned that Kreia plans to strengthen a massive wound in the Force made ten years prior
This wound had been created by the Exile during the Mandalorian Wars when they activated a superweapon in order to end the battle on the planet Malachor V causing mass death and destruction
Before following her to Malachor V where Kreia had since rejoined the Sith as Darth Traya the Exile stops a Sith invasion of Telos defeating one of Traya s former apprentices the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus
On Malachor V the Exile is separated from their companions and fights through hordes of monsters on the planet s surface and the inhabitants of a large Sith Academy that survived the cataclysm
On the final floor of the academy the Exile kills the Sith Lord Darth Sion and confronts Darth Traya in the planet s core
The Exile defeats the Sith Lord but before Traya dies she delivers a prophetic vision of the future pertaining to the player s companions and the worlds that were visited over the course of the story
Depending on the Exile s alignment they either order the destruction of Malachor V escaping before it is destroyed and travel into the Unknown Regions in search of Revan or remain on Malachor V as the new Dark Lord of the Sith

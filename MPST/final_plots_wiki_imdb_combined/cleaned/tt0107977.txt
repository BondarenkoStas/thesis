Unbeknownst to Richard the prince is abusing his power
Robin returns to his family home Loxley Hall only to find it being repossessed by John s men
His family s blind servant Blinkin informs Robin that his family members and pets have all died as well and the only thing his father left him is a key which opens the greatest treasure in all the land
Robin recruits the large and ignorant Little John and his friend Will Scarlet O Hara to help regain his father s land and oust Prince John from the throne
On his quest Robin also attracts the attention of Maid Marian of Bagelle who wants to find the man who has the key to her heart
They are also joined by Rabbi Tuckman who shares with them his sacramental wine and bargain circumcisions
While Robin is training his band of tights clad Merry Men the spoonerism spouting Sheriff of Rottingham hires the Mafioso Don Giovanni to assassinate Robin at the Spring Festival spoofing a similarly outlandish plot twist from the Costner movie involving Scottish mercenaries
The archer who will carry out the assassination is a parody of Clint Eastwood s Man with No Name character
Maid Marian hears of the evil plot and sneaks out of her castle to warn Robin accompanied by her frumpy German Lady in Waiting Broomhilde
The Sheriff and Don expect that Robin will not refuse a chance to participate in the archery tournament due to his pride and Robin does just that
At the archery tournament a disguised Robin makes it to the final round where he makes his shot but loses to his opponent
Robin calls this situation absurd takes off his disguise and pulls out a copy of the movie s script to discover that he gets another shot
The Sheriff and Prince John then pull out their own copies and confirm this

Robin then takes the second shot this time using a special PATRIOT arrow and hits the target

Before Marian can say I do the castle is attacked by the Men in Tights led by Little John Ahchoo Blinkin and Will

After winning the fight Robin spares the sheriff s life only to miss his sheath and accidentally run the sheriff through

Rabbi Tuckman conducts the ceremony but they are suddenly interrupted by King Richard recently returned from the Crusades who insists on sanctioning the marriage with a kiss to the new bride
He orders John to be taken away to the Tower of London and made part of the tour
He also announces that as the Prince has surrounded his given name with a foul stench all the toilets in the kingdom are to be renamed johns
All being as it should be Robin and Marian are married and Ahchoo is made the new sheriff of Rottingham

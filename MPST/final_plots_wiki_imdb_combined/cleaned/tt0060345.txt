The Grinch is a bitter grouchy cave dwelling creature with a heart two sizes too small who lives on snowy Mount Crumpit a steep high mountain just north of the town of Whoville home of the merry and warm hearted Whos
His only companion is his unloved but loyal dog Max
From his cave the Grinch can hear the noisy Christmas festivities that take place in Whoville
Annoyed he decides to stop Christmas from coming by stealing their presents trees and food for their Christmas feast
He crudely disguises himself as Santa Claus and forces Max disguised as a reindeer to drag a sleigh to Whoville
Once there the Grinch slides down the chimney and steals all of the Whos Christmas presents the Christmas tree and the log for their fire
He is briefly interrupted in his burglary by Cindy Lou a little Who girl but concocts a crafty lie to effect his escape from her home
The Grinch then takes his sleigh to the top of Mount Crumpit and prepares to dump all of the presents into the abyss
As dawn breaks he expects to hear the Whos bitter and sorrowful cries but is confused to hear them singing a joyous Christmas song instead
He puzzles for a moment until it dawns on him that maybe Christmas perhaps means a little bit more than just presents and feasting
The Grinch s shrunken heart suddenly grows three sizes
The reformed Grinch returns all of the Whos presents and trimmings and is warmly invited to the Whos feast where he has the honor of carving the Roast Beast

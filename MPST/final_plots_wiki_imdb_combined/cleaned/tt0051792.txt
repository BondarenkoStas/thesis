Huzur Biswambhar Roy is a middle aged aristrocrat in India
His estate is suffering financially but he continues to engage in the indulgences that he thrives off of
He has a palace that includes an opulent music room replete with a huge chandelier mirrored walls and various rugs
He also loves riding his white horse or his domesticated elephant
He is somewhat insulated and basically only interacts with his estate manager his servant and his beloved wife Mahamaya and young teenaged son Khoka The wealthy Mahim Ganguly the son of a neighbor who was a debt collector returns from the West to claim his late father s estate
Ganguly is a shrill social climber and asks that Roy come to visit the estate
When Ganguly builds his own more modern music room he plans an opening party
In competition Roy claims and starts to plan his own music room party
This is despite his financial floundering Mahamaya and Khoka go to visit friends via boat while Roy stays behind
Upon their returning boatride a storm hits and kills nearly everyone on board the boat including Mahamaya and Khoka
Roy withdrawals into grieving and a long lasting depression
The anguish he goes through ages him visably Four years go by with Roy by himself in his palace
On day Ganguly visits and boasts about a young female dancer who has discovered a new form dancing that is performing at his music room
The younger man s grating manners gives Roy the motivation to have yet another music room party
Roy s servant is estatic but his estate manager is less than happy since Roy is even more financially destitute than before
The music room is re opened for the first time since his family s death and cleaned up
The female dancer is booked and several neighbors attend including Ganguly
The dancer and the music group give a magnificent performance Roy lingers in the music room throughout the night long after the last guests leave
Drunkly he pays tribute to his ancestors and his own portrait
However his bliss turns to hysterical despair when the candles in the music room start to go out
Obviously mental unsound his fear of the darkening room mystifies his faithful servant
The servant is able to open the drapes and Roy is comforted by the rising sun
Roy hears his white horse nay outside and claims that the horse is calling to him to ride him
His servant and estate manager are distressed since Roy s dilapidated physical state makes horse riding dangerous now
Roy gallops off quickly on his horse with the estate manager and servant in pursuit
When he rides to the beach he is distressed to see a beaching broken boat which reminds him of his departed family
He doesn t change the horse s course and upon nearly colliding with the boat the horse flips out and jumps in the air knocking Roy roughly into the ground
Roy dies where he lays with his servant and estate manager standing over him

The story unfolds in flashbacks giving details of two separate relationships that become intertwined with each other
During a performance of Café Müller a dance theatre piece by Pina Bausch Benigno Martín and Marco Zuluaga cross paths but the two men are no more than strangers
Still Benigno notices that Marco cries
Marco is a journalist and travel writer who happens to see a TV interview with Lydia González a famous female matador
He thinks that an article on her would be interesting and on the instructions of his editor he contacts her in a bar where she asks him to take her to her house
As they talk she elaborates on the fact that she broke up with her boyfriend el Niño de Valencia another matador something that has been all over the tabloids
As Marco confesses that he knows nothing of bullfighting and that he is a journalist she becomes angry and leaves his car without saying a word
As he drives off he hears a scream inside her house and stops Lydia rushes off and climbs back into his car she asks him to kill a snake that she found in her house
He does so and comes out of the house crying
With that new confidence established between them they become friends and later on lovers
Marco attends a wedding in Toledo and is surprised to find Lydia there too since she had said that she did not want to go
The wedding turns out to be that of Marco s former fiancée Angela who had the same phobia of snakes as Lydia Marco was very much in love with Angela and had a very hard time getting over her
Lydia says that she has something important to say but she prefers to wait until after the bullfight that afternoon but she is gored and becomes comatose
Marco does not leave her side at the hospital and finally befriends Benigno who recognizes him from the dance theatre performance
Marco is told by the doctors that people in a coma never wake up and that while there are miracle stories of people who have come back he should not keep his hopes high
Benigno is a personal nurse and caregiver for Alicia Roncero a beautiful dance student who lies in a coma but Benigno sees her as alive he talks his heart out to her and brings her all kinds of dancing and silent black and white film mementos
As it turns out Benigno had been obsessed with Alicia for a while before she was in a coma since his apartment is in front of the dance studio where she practiced every day
At first his obsession was only from a distance since Benigno was taking care of his possessive mother who seemed to be immobile
For that reason he became a nurse and also a beautician
Free to move about after his mother dies he finally picks up the courage to talk to Alicia after she dropped her wallet on the street
As they walk together to her house they talk about her discovery of silent black and white films and about dancing
When she walks into her building Benigno notices that she lives in the house of Dr Roncero who is a psychiatrist
Benigno makes an appointment to see the doctor and talks about his unresolved bereavement grief over his mother
But it is all a ruse to gain access to the apartment where he steals a hair clip from Alicia s room
That night Alicia is run over by a car and becomes comatose
By mere chance Benigno is assigned to Alicia much to the surprise of her father
But since Benigno s services are the best he hires him and a colleague permanently to tend for Alicia
Benigno also tells Dr Roncero that he is gay possibly so that Alicia s father won t suspect his love for her or possibly so that he won t question Benigno s particular attachment to her
Benigno keeps telling Marco that he should talk to Lydia because despite the fact that they are in a coma women understand and react to men s problems
Eventually Marco learns from el Niño de Valencia that Lydia and el Niño had decided to be together again and that she intended to tell Marco
So Marco finds himself alone again
As he is about to leave he comes into Alicia s room looking for Benigno but he instead finds himself opening his heart out to her despite his scepticism over Benigno s theories
Benigno and Marco leave the hospital and in the parking lot Benigno tells Marco of his plans to marry Alicia Marco is taken aback telling his friend that Alicia is basically dead and cannot express her will in any manner
But Benigno does not hear any reason
During a routine review at the hospital the supervisors notice that Alicia has missed several periods since this is a common occurrence with people in a coma they do not think twice over it
In reality Alicia was raped months before and is pregnant Benigno is the main suspect and is later sent to prison
Marco has left Spain to write a book about travelling
Months later in Jordan he reads in a newspaper that Lydia has finally died having never awakened from her coma
He phones the hospital looking for Benigno only to hear that Benigno does not work there any more
Marco manages to talk to another nurse whom he had befriended she tells him that Benigno is now in prison for the alleged rape of Alicia
Marco returns to Spain and visits Benigno who asks him to hire a new lawyer and find out what happened to Alicia
Marco stays in Benigno s apartment and sees that Alicia has awakened during or after delivering a stillborn baby
Following the urging of Benigno s lawyer Marco does not tell Benigno about Alicia s unexpected recovery
Desperate Benigno writes a farewell letter to Marco and takes a large quantity of pills to try to escape into a coma thus reuniting with Alicia
He dies of an overdose
Meanwhile Alicia has begun rehabilitation to recover her ability to walk and dance
The film ends in the same theatre where it began where Marco and Alicia meet by chance

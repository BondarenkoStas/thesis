For the plot of the play see A Midsummer Night s Dream
Only a synopsis of scenes provided with music is given here
Act 1 The first scene set to music occurs after Titania has left Oberon following an argument over the ownership of a little Indian boy
Two of her fairies sing of the delights of the countryside
A drunken stuttering poet enters singing Fill up the bowl
The stuttering has led many to believe the scene is based on the habits of Thomas d Urfey
However it may also be poking fun at Elkanah Settle who stuttered as well and was long thought to be the librettist due to an error in his 1910 biography
The fairies mock the drunken poet and drive him away
With its quick repartee and its broadly realistic portrayal of the poor victim the Masque of the Drunken Poet is the closest episode in Purcell s London stage works to full fledged opera as the Italians knew it
Act 2 It begins after Oberon has ordered Puck to anoint the eyes of Demetrius with the love juice
Titania and her fairies merrily revel and Night Mystery Secrecy and Sleep lull them asleep and leave them to pleasant dreams
Act 3 Titania has fallen in love with Bottom much to Oberon s gratification
A Nymph sings of the pleasures and torments of love and after several dances Titania and Bottom are entertained by the foolish loving banter of two haymakers Corydon and Mopsa
Act 4 It begins after Titania has been freed from her enchantment commencing with a brief divertissement to celebrate Oberon s birthday but for the most part it is a masque of the god Phoebus and the Four Seasons
Act 5 After Theseus has been told of the lovers adventures in the wood it begins with the goddess Juno singing an epithalamium Thrice happy lovers followed by a woman who sings the well known The Plaint
A Chinese man and woman enter singing several songs about the joys of their world

Two other Chinese women summon Hymen who sings in praise of married bliss thus uniting the wedding theme of A Midsummer Night s Dream with the celebration of William and Mary s anniversary

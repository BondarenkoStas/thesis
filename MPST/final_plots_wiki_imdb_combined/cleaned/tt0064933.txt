Years after a zombie apocalypse survivors have set up outposts across the United States
One outpost in the city of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania contains a feudal like government
Bordered on two sides by rivers and on the third by an electric fence the city has become a sanctuary
The rich and powerful live in a luxury high rise called Fiddler s Green while the rest of the population subsists in squalor
Paul Kaufman the city s ruthless ruler has sponsored Dead Reckoning an armored personnel vehicle that can travel through the zombie infested areas with ease
Riley Denbo is the designer and commander of Dead Reckoning
Unlike Kaufman Riley is respected for his work in protecting the citizens as well as providing them with food and medical supplies that the citizens can no longer safely acquire themselves
Using Dead Reckoning Riley and his crew ventured into areas overrun with zombies to scavenge for supplies
On this mission they notice many zombies exhibiting intelligent behavior
One such zombie is Big Daddy formerly a gas station owner
After the mission Riley retires from commanding Dead Reckoning
Back to the city he gets to Chihuahua s bar
There he sees a hooker named Slack being forced in a cage with some zombies to entertain guests
Riley and Charlie save Slack Charlie kills Chihuahua in the ensuing chaos
Riley Charlie and Slack are arrested
Slack reveals that Kaufman ordered her execution for helping Mulligan to instigate rebellion among the poor
Meanwhile Cholo DeMora Dead Reckoning s second in command is denied an apartment in Fiddler s Green despite his service to Kaufman
In retaliation Cholo takes over Dead Reckoning and threatens to destroy Fiddler s Green with it
Kaufman approaches Riley and tasks him as well as Charlie and Slack to retrieve Dead Reckoning
They are supervised by Manolete Motown and Pillsbury
On the way Manolete is bitten and then killed by Slack
After catching up with Dead Reckoning Riley approaches the vehicle alone
Charlie Slack and Pillsbury follow him after subduing Motown and leaving her behind
Realising Riley is working for Kaufman Cholo holds both Riley and Charlie at gunpoint
As he prepares to fire Dead Reckoning s missiles at Fiddler s Green Riley uses a small device and deactivates Dead Reckoning s weapons systems he then destroys the device
Motown who had regained consciousness opens fire and nearly kills both Riley and Cholo
She is bitten by a zombie and killed by Slack
Riley convinces Cholo to allow him escape North and to join him but the latter decides to head back to Fiddler s Green to deal with Kaufman his partner Foxy accompanies him
While en route Cholo is bitten by a zombie and leaves to kill Kaufman by himself
Riley takes over Dead Reckoning once again and returns to Fiddler s Green
Elsewhere Big Daddy learns that they can walk safely underwater
He leads the zombies to cross the river to the human city
They take the guards by surprise and begin massacring the people
As a result of the zombies making it into the city the electric fences that once kept the zombies out have now become a wall to trap them and the humans inside
Seeing the city overrun Kaufman runs with his money and encounters a zombified Cholo in the parking garage
As the two struggle Big Daddy kills both with a propane tank
Riley s group arrives at the city only to come upon a drawbridge having already been drawn
Riley leaves to bring the bridge down but a small group of zombies begin to attack Dead Reckoning
Riley and the others manage to dispose and evade the zombies
After crossing the bridge they helplessly witness people being killed by the zombies
Realizing it is too late to save them they mercy kill them with missiles
It is then revealed that most of the poor people were led to safety by Mulligan thus surviving the assault
Riley and Mulligan share a well meaning goodbye as they split up with their groups
As they see Big Daddy and the zombies who are curiously not attacking the surviving humans leaving the city Riley decides to leave them alone citing that they are just looking for a place to go to
While lighting up the rest of the fireworks Riley s group set off for Canada on Dead Reckoning

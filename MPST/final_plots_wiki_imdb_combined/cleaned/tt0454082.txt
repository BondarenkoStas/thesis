On a snowy winter night on Christmas Eve in the Alpha Kappa Gamma sorority house Lauren is getting changed into her pajamas
In the next room Clair Crosby is writing a Christmas card to her half sister Leigh
Suddenly she hears something from her closet
She goes over to the closet door and looks inside
Nothing but clothes
She goes back to her card and sees that her fountain pen is missing
Suddenly a figure wraps a bag around her head
In the struggle the figure stabs the pen into her eye At a mental institution not far away Billy Lenz is being served his Christmas dinner
He is locked away rocking back and fourth in his rocking chair safely in his cell that is decorated with Christmas lights
The orderly serving the food gets a scare from a volunteer dressed as Santa who is looking for the children s ward
Security guard J Bailey makes jokes to the orderly about Billy trying to escape every year
The orderly and Santa walk away leaving the security guard alone in the hall
Billy opens the small window on his cell and places a present wrapped in newspaper on the ledge for the security guard
The security guard opens it to find nothing that interesting except on the newspaper is written I ll be home for Christmas
The security guard looks into the cell to find it empty and Billy s chair rocking back and fourth
He quickly opens the cell and goes inside to find a hole in the wall
He takes his flashlight and looks into the hole as Billy comes from under the bed and stabs him in the neck with a candy cane
Billy leaves the cell and kills the man dressed as Santa
He steals his outfit stuffs his body in a bag and leaves the institution dumping the bag in the dumpster with the man s hand sticking out from the bag Outside of the sorority house Kelli Presley and her boyfriend Kyle Autry are talking in his car
She tells him that she is going to spend Christmas with her roommates but that she will make it up to him
He is disappointed because this is their first Christmas together
She kisses him goodbye and goes inside the house
As she does her fellow sorority sister Megan Helms calls Kyle on his cell phone
Meanwhile Megan is in her room watching an old home made porn movie that features her and Kyle
Kyle hangs up the phone
Kelli goes inside and greets everyone including Melissa Kitt her best friend
Heather Fitzgerald Dana Mathis Lauren Hannon and Ms MacHenry the house mother who loves all of the girls and accepts their flaws They have a secret santa gift giving thing going and Ms Mac wants to know who got Billy
According to her Billy killed his family here
When Billy was born he has a liver disorder that makes his skin yellow
His father loves him regardless but his mother is disappointed and wants nothing to do with him
They live in the house that is now the sorority house
As Billy gets a bit older he is treated even worse by his mother who has become an alcoholic
On Christmas his mother tells him Santa was shot down by the Russians
His father however tells him he has a present for him hidden in a stow away space in Billy s closet
Billy goes into his room which will become Eve s in the present day and finds a telescope maing him very happy
A few years later his mother and father are not getting along very well and his mom is having an affair
Billy hears them arguing and looks under their door to witness his father with a bag over his head and his head being bashed in with a hammer
Billy runs back to his room as his mother and her lover take the body outside and begin to bury it in the crawl space under the house
Billy is watching this and is discovered
His mother chases him into the attic and locks him in there All of the girls are horrified by this story but Ms Mac assures them it is all true
Heather says she was the one who drew Billy s name for secret Santa but she thought it was wrong to buy him a gift because he was a murderer and it was offensive to the birth of Jesus to make a mockery of gift giving
Heather starts to go upstairs to her room but runs into Eve Agnew
Eve has been upstairs the whole time and is leaving to go visit her family
She gives Heather her secret santa gift a crystal statue of a unicorn
Heather is less than impressed and bids Eve farewell
Eve goes towards the door but Ms Mac tells her she has a present for her
Before she can find it Eve leaves obviously disappointed by Heather s reaction Kelli and Lauren go upstairs to tell Clair and Megan they are going to open the presents
Clair obviously doesn t answer
Lauren pounds on the door and says she is going to steal her presents if she doesn t get down here
Laughing Kelli does this on Megan s door
Megan tells them to go away and she doesn t want to open presents
They leave and Megan hears a snow globe tune playing in the attic
She goes into the attic and asks if someone is playing a joke
She gets more then she bargained for when she finds Clair s body by the window in a rocking chair
Someone comes from behind and smashes the snow globe into her head
She falls onto the ground as a bag is put over her head
She fights back but the figure rips out one of her eyes with their bare hand The home phone rings Melissa answers it and puts it on loud speaker
The caller is making all sorts of weird noises
Lauren teases him and the caller threatens to kill Lauren before hanging up
Heather says someone is obviously sick in the head and doesn t need to be provoked by Lauren
Melissa checks the caller ID and is surprised to see it s coming from Megan s cell
They assure themselves it s just a joke They open their presents with Ms Mac getting some lingerie as a gag gift
Everyone laughs and Kelli goes back upstairs to check on the girls
Kyle suddenly pops out of Megan s room
Kelli screams and the other girls rush upstairs
Kyle apologizes and says he wanted to surprise her
Ms Mac asks if Megan is in her room and Kyle says he doesn t know
Lauren asks him how he could have just been in her room and not know if she is in there
He explains that it s really dark in there
He makes a joke about Billy getting her
He then tells everyone another story about Billy s past Billy was kept in the attic for many years
His mother and stepfather lived happily without him
Everything was wonderful except his mom couldn t get pregnant by his step father so she crept into the attic and had sex with Billy her own son
Nine months later she gave birth to a baby girl named Agnes
As Agnes grew older Billy became jealous
One Christmas Agnes got a doll for a present
A jealous Billy releases a tantrum and breaks the attic door open and rushes to the living room attacking Agnes and pulling out one of her eyes stabbing his stepfather in the face and beating his mom to death with a dough roller
When the police arrive on the scene they find him eating a cookie made from his mother s flesh
Agnes was put into an orphanage and no one knows where she is today The girls are freaked out by the story
Kelli goes inside Megan s room and finds the porn video on the computer
She breaks down and Kyle tells her it was from a long time ago
Kelli screams for him to leave the house and he becomes enraged calling the women spoilt bitches
Ms Mac goes off on him about treating Kelli like that pushing him towards the stairs
As Kyle leaves a figure is standing by the tree looking at the presents
Ms Mac asks who the person is
Clair s half sister Leigh tells the girls that Claire never called her telling her she was ready to be picked up and she is worried
Dana says she even had no idea Clair had a sister
Leigh explains they are only half sisters and are trying to get to know each other Suddenly the power goes out in the house
Dana says the circuit breaker is under the house and she will go turn it on
She goes outside and smokes dropping her cigarette into a hole on the porch
She hears someone underneath it
Taking her flashlight she opens the door to the crawl space and looks inside
Suddenly someone grabs her pulling her in
The two struggle as the figure grabs a gardening tool and stabs Dana in the head
Lauren is beyond drunk now having been drinking booze the whole night
Melissa tells her she smells and needs to shower
As she showers someone watches from a broken tile in the floor
After the shower Lauren goes to bed Everyone starts asking where the other girls are since Clair Megan and Dana have disappeared
Kelli questions what is taking Dana so long and is even more startled when someone calls from Dana s cell number and hangs up
The rest of the girls go outside to look for Dana
Heather and Leigh find Eve s car still parked outside
They open the car door and scream as Eve s severed head rolls out
The girls scream and run back into the house locking the door behind them

Ms Mac tells everyone that they can pile into her car and try to find help
Kelli says that they won t get far and that they need to stick together
Heather says she wants to leave and Ms Mac tells the girls that they can stay and she will go with Heather to find help
The two go outside and get in the car
Ms Mac gets out of the car to scrape the ice off of the windshield

She grabs a stick and hits the figure with it
Melissa opens a window and is going to climb out but the figure throws an ice skate at her cutting off the back of her head Kelli and Leigh rush inside and call for Melissa
There is no answer and they go to Lauren s room closing the door behind them
But someone is on the other side of the door and kicks it open
It s Kyle
Leigh attacks him and he throws her against Lauren s bed causing the covers fall off of Lauren who is very much dead with her eyes gouged out
Everyone screams and Kyle insists he isn t the killer

She gets up and sees the figure has a glass eye
It s Agnes
Kelli tells Agnes everything is okay and she doesn t have to do this
She tells him her brother isn t here he is still locked away
Agnes tells her that she doesn t have a brother only a father
Billy comes from behind and lights a candle Agnes attacks Kelli but is knocked into another hole in the floor that pins her between the walls
Billy pushes Kelli into the same hole accidentally knocking over the candle
Kelli has grabbed onto a string of Christmas light attached to a small tree trying to keep from falling completely in
She screams for help as Agnes starts to crawl up the hole
Leigh comes to her rescue smashing open the wall
Agnes grabs Leigh s head but she manages to fight her off
Leigh runs through the house and smashes out another wall finally reaching the spot where Kelli is trapped

The two survivors rush outside At the hospital Kelli is going to have some tests done to make sure she is okay
Leigh has a present in her hand from Clair
She tells Kelli she wants to open it now because she won t be able to open it in front of her family
She says that she is glad she got to know Clair before all of this happened
She opens the present and finds a watch engraved with Family Forever
She starts to cry as a nurse comes in and tells Kelli they need her for some x rays Some time later Leigh goes back to Kelli room to see if she is back from the x rays
A body with blonde hair lays in the bed but as she approaches the person turns over to reveal Agnes
Leigh screams as Agnes grabs her by the throat and snaps her neck Kelli comes back into the room and feels something is wrong
She finds Leigh s new watch
She sees blood on the ceiling above her and starts to leave the room but Agnes grabs her from behind the curtain and starts to strangle her
Kelli grabs a defibrillator paddle and shocks Agnes in the head with it killing her
This is the ending for the UK version
The US version continues from here when Billy comes down from the ceiling as Kelli rushes from the room
She grabs some crutches that are in the hall and starts to beat him with it
She turns to run thinking he is unconscious but he grabs her foot causing her to fall over a medical cart
Billy grabs a scalpel from the pile of medical supplies now on the floor and takes chase
Kelli rushes to the stairs as Billy comes from behind slashing her with the scalpel
She grabs him and throws him over the stairway causing him to fall on top of the Christmas tree below impaling him
His intestines spew out he is very much dead and Kelli is left to look on in shock as the credits start

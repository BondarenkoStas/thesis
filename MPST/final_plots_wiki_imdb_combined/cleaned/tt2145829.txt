Not long after the invasion and occupation of Earth by a race of powerful robots wanting human knowledge and ingenuity humans are confined to their homes
Leaving without permission would be to risk their lives
Monitored by the electronic implants in their necks the robot sentries are able to track the movements of humans in order to control them
If any person comes out of their home they are given warnings by the robot sentries to get inside their home
If the person does not comply they are immediately incinerated
In what starts out as a bit of fun a bunch of clever kids in a British town manage to tamper with the implants in their necks and stay out after their curfew
Having discovered the capabilities of the electronic implants they quickly realise how important this information could be to save the imprisoned human race
Led by the talented Sean who discovers he has the mental ability to interface with and control the robots the kids band together and recruit other people who want to stand up against the robots rule
Standing in their way are human collaborators led by Smythe and the kids must summon all their emotional and physical strength in order to battle against their control
After a run in with the collaborators clues eventually lead them to a hideaway community in an abandoned mine where Sean is reunited with his father but the robots soon descend on the community seeking Sean offering an amnesty in exchange for him
Sean mentally controls a robot craft that rams and destroys the cube the local robot mothership halting this invasion
He narrowly escapes the impact
He interfaces with a damaged Mediator a robot in human form and mentally sends commands to end the invasion of the Earth destroying the robots and their craft
The film ends with jubilation as the local population celebrate in town
In the closing scene Sean looks up at the stars

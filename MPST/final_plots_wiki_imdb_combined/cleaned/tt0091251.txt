In 1943 two Byelorussian boys dig in a sand field looking for abandoned rifles in order to join the Soviet partisan forces
One of the boys Florya finds an SVT 40 rifle and the next day partisans arrive at Florya s house to conscript him
Florya becomes a low rank militiaman and is ordered to perform menial tasks
When the partisans are ready to move on their commander Kosach orders Florya to remain behind at the camp
Bitterly disappointed Florya walks into the forest weeping and meets Glasha and the two bond before the camp is suddenly attacked by German paratroopers and dive bombers
Florya is partially deafened from explosions before the two hide in the forest to avoid the German soldiers
Florya and Glasha travel to his village only to find his home deserted and covered in flies
Denying that his family is dead Florya believes that they are hiding on a nearby island across a bog
As they leave the village Glasha sees a pile of bodies behind the house but does not alert Florya
The two become hysterical after wading through the bog where Glasha screams at Florya his family were dead in the village
They are soon met by Roubej a partisan fighter who takes them to a large group of villagers who have fled the Germans
Florya sees an elderly villager badly burnt by the Germans who tells him that he witnessed his family s execution
Florya accepts that his family is dead and blames himself for the tragedy
Roubej takes Florya and two other men to find food at a nearby warehouse only to find it being guarded by German troops and during their retreat the group unknowingly wanders through a minefield resulting in the deaths of the two companions
That evening Roubej and Florya sneak up to an occupied village and manage to steal a cow from a collaborating farmer however Roubej and the cow are shot and killed by a German machine gun
The next morning Florya attempts to steal a horse and cart but the owner catches him but instead of doing him harm he helps hide Florya s identity when SS troops approach
Florya is taken to the village of Perekhody where they hurriedly discuss a fake identity for him while the SS unit accompanied by Byelorussian collaborators surround and occupy the village
Florya tries to warn the townsfolk they are being herded to their deaths but is forced to join them inside a church
Florya and a young woman bearing a strong resemblance to Glasha manage to escape the young woman is dragged by her hair across the ground and herded into a truck to be gang raped while Florya is forced to watch as grenades are thrown into the church before it is set ablaze and shot
A German officer points a gun to Florya s head to pose for a picture before leaving him to slump to the ground and die as the soldiers leave
Florya later wanders out of the scorched village in the direction of the Germans where he discovers they had been ambushed by the partisans
After recovering his jacket and rifle Florya comes across the young woman who had also escaped the church in a fugue state after having been gang raped and beaten
Florya returns to the village and finds that his fellow partisans have captured eleven of the Germans and their collaborators including the commander
Kosach forces most of the collaborators to douse the Germans with a can of petrol but the disgusted crowd shoots them all before they can be set on fire ending their lives relatively painlessly
As the partisans leave Florya notices a framed portrait of Adolf Hitler in a puddle and shoots it the first time he has used his rifle
In the film s final scene Florya catches up and blends in with his partisan comrades marching through the woods as snow blankets the ground

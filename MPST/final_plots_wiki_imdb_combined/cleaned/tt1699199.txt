The game begins in medias res with Asgard being invaded by the Jötun
Thor meanwhile is training with Sif and his brother Loki
Their training is interrupted however by the arrival of the jötuns
While Loki leaves to inform Odin about the invasion Thor is left to fight alone after Sif is frozen by one of the arriving jötun
After quickly fending his enemies off and setting Sif free Thor goes to Odin s castle to defend Asgard
The invasion is stopped but Sif is fatally wounded in the process
After Thor is denied retribution for the invasion and Sif s condition by Odin Thor disobeys his father s orders and travels to Niflheim aided by one of Loki s projected clones
While Thor travels to Nilfheim it is shown that Odin manages to save Syf from dead and then he proceeds to enter the Odinsleep
As Thor arrives to Nilfheim Loki tells him to find Ymir Lord of the Jötun and Ruler of Niflheim
Thor finds and after a long battle defeats Ymir inside the Cave of Ages
There Thor finds the source of a power that as Loki says can destroy the entire realm of Niflheim
Ignoring Ymir s warnings Thor activates the source which transforms into a golden metallic minotaur like creature known as Mangog that instantly vaporizes Ymir
Loki then sends an unaware Thor to Vanaheim instead of Asgard as Thor originally wanted as Loki had previously stroke a deal with Ulik for him to delay Thor s return to Asgard and in exchange Loki would repair Vanaheim s Frostgrinder and allow Ulik to leave Vanaheim
While Thor makes his way through Vanaheim back in Asgard Mangog wreaks havok throughout the city
Loki tries to stop Mangog using the freezing casket from Niflheim
His plan backfires as Mangog easily breaks free from the ice due to the fire that it emits
Mangog summons an army of Jötun and Infernir forcing Loki to change his plans and ask Ulik to allow Thor to use the Frostgrinder but Ulik betrays Loki
Thor meanwhile reaches the doors of the Frostgrinder
There he discovers through a historical record of Vanaheim that it was Odin who originally created Mangog after the Vanir had declared war against Asgard
The Vanir were unable to control and defeat Mangog but they found out that Mangog s only weakness is a god created mineral called Scabrite Thor eventually confronts and defeats Ulik
As Loki tells Thor about the state of Asgard Thor reveals Mangog s only possible weakness to Loki
Loki informs Thor that Scabrite can only be found in one realm Muspelheim home of the Infernir
Thor then travels to Muspelheim where he faces Surtur Lord of the Infernir and ruler of Muspelheim
Thor manages to defeat Surtur and claim his sword Twilight
Thor then destroys Twilight which releases its Scabrite filled enegry which in turn is absorbed by Mjolnir
Thor then returns to Asgard where Loki tells him that before he faces Mangog he has to help Heimdall and a fully recovered Sif retake the Bifrost s obvservatory
After Thor successfully helps Heimdall and Sif he goes to face Mangog in combat aided by Loki and a weakened Odin
After a long fight Thor defeats Mangog
He then apologizes to Odin for releasing Mangog out of anger and pride but Odin says it is he himself who should apologize as it was he himself who created Mangog in the first place
Odin then releases the souls of the Vanir trapped within Mangog to their fate in afterlife as the game ends

As soon as the hero and his party have entered the city proper they see Irenicus fighting off some of his attackers
After he has destroyed his attackers he notices the hero and his companions

The heroes enter Spellhold but are captured by Irenicus who has taken control of the prison and had planned all along to bring the protagonist there

The film starts with a naked figure sitting in a tree in what looks like a mental asylum
Nurses come out to him bringing a plate of conventional food and also one of a raw fish
As they try to coax him off of his perch it is the fish that persuades him to come down
As the nurses get him to put on some overalls the viewer sees that he has a tattoo of phoenix on his chest
Flashback The film flashes back into Fenix s childhood which he spent performing as a child magician in a circus run by his father Orgo the knife thrower and his mother Concha a trapeze artist and aerialist
The circus crew also includes among others a tattooed woman who acts as the object of Orgo s knife throwing feats her adopted daughter Alma Fenix s midget friend Aladin a pack of clowns and a small elephant
Orgo carries on a very public flirtation with the tattooed woman and their knife throwing act is heavily sexualized
Concha is also the leader of a religious cult that considers as its patron saint a little girl who was raped and had her arms cut off by two brothers
Their church is about to be bulldozed at the behest of the owner of the land and the followers make one last stand against the police and the bulldozers
A Roman Catholic Monsignor drives into the conflict saying that he will prevent its demolition but after he enters the temple to inspect it he deems it blasphemous and unworthy so the demolition is carried out
Fenix leads Concha back to the circus where she finds out about Orgo s affair but Orgo being also a hypnotist puts Concha in a trance and rapes her
The circus elephant then dies much to Fenix s grief and a public funeral is conducted in which the elephant is paraded through the city inside a giant casket
The casket is then dropped into the city dump where scavengers open it up and proceed to carve up the elephant and take away the meat
Orgo consoles his son by tattooing a spread eagled phoenix onto his chest identical to the one on his own chest using a knife dipped in red ink
This tattoo Orgo says will make Fenix a man
Later on Concha during her trapeze act sees Orgo and the tattooed woman sneak out of the big top
She chases after them and seeing them sexually engaged pours a bottle of sulphuric acid onto Orgo s genitals
Orgo retaliates by cutting off both her arms
He then walks into the street and slits his own throat
Fenix witnesses this locked inside a trailer
He then sees the tattooed woman driving off with Alma
Flash forward Back in the present Fenix is taken out to a movie theater along with other patients most of whom have Down syndrome
A pimp intercepts them and persuades them to take cocaine and follow him to meet an overweight prostitute
Fenix then spots the Tattooed Woman who is now a prostitute and becomes filled with rage
Back in the asylum Fenix s armless mother Concha calls out for him from the street and he escapes by climbing down a rope from his cell window
The Tattooed Woman is shown trying to prostitute Alma who runs away and sleeps on the roof of a truck
The Tattooed Woman is then mutilated and killed by unseen woman s hands
Mother and son go on to perform an act whereby he stands behind her and moves his arms to make it look as if Concha s arms are moving
But Concha soon starts to use her son s hands to kill those women who she deems a threat to her including a young woman whom he kills with a knife throw as well as a cross dressing wrestler whom he slashes with a sword
It is revealed in a dream that he has killed many more women all of whose memories haunt him
Alma finds Fenix and together they plan to run away from Concha and her house
She tries to force Fenix to murder Alma as well but after a struggle he manages to plunge a knife into Concha s stomach but she doesn t die and reveals to him that she will always be inside him vanishing before his eyes
Through a series of flashbacks it is revealed that Concha actually died after being maimed by Orgo and that Fenix has kept a mannequin of his armless mother while performing on stage and at home
He destroys the home made temple and throws away the mannequin with the help of his imaginary childhood friends Aladin and the clowns
The police are waiting outside the house and order Fenix and Alma to put their hands up
Both comply and Fenix watches his own hands with awe as he does so
He realises that he has regained control of them which brings him joy

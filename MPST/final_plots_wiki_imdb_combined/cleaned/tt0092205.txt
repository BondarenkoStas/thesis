Father Mahoney is a missionary priest in the Amazon and on occasion reports to his superior Father O Reilly who disapproves of his plans to save the indigenous people of the area through medicine and development
He is instead encouraged to focus on saving souls
After a final and disappointing meeting with Father O Reilly Father Mahoney ventures by canoe into the black waters of the Amazon only to encounter an Indian woman living in the jungle the same one he has seen before and who he claims continues to tempt him
Known through local folklore as a seductive spirit who can change into a river dolphin Father Mahoney is overcome by his desire during this particular encounter and is intimate with the woman
Before leaving he gives to her the crucifix from around his neck
On his return to the missionary that same day Father Mahoney s boat capsizes and he is killed by an anaconda never knowing the woman he left behind is now with child
The woman raises her son alone in the jungle where he grows up in an idyllic existence swimming with the river dolphins
One day the mother is discovered by a band of hunters using a motorized boat and during a struggle she is killed
Led by Orlando Santos the group of men and their murderous act are witnessed by the child in the forest
They grab the boy and toss him into the river
No longer seeing the boy they assume he has drowned and depart
Moments mater the river dolphins come to his rescue and take him to shore
At age six he is left to fend for himself in the forest
Over the years a story of a feral child spreads through the towns along the river and when the boy is ten he is captured and taken to town
The capture of the dolphin boy comes to the attention of Father O Reilly
When he sees that the boy is wearing Mahoney s crucifix he realizes that he is Mahoney s child
With great excitement that part of Mahoney has lived in O Reilly takes in and baptizes the boy who does not speak or understand language
O Reilly names him Lazaro and places him in an orphanage run by nuns
There the boy learns to speak and is befriended by an older boy called Segundo
Father O Reilly continues to visit Lazaro usually taking him out for ice cream and teaching him Christian values such as the concept of forgiveness particularly toward the men that killed his mother
The orphans are presented to a benefactor of the orphanage a successful businessman who is also a candidate for governor of the province
Lazaro recognizes the benefactor as Orlando Santos the man who killed his mother
Lazaro runs away from the orphanage intent on finding Santos and killing him
Segundo insists on going with him
Father O Reilly learns that Lazaro has run away and begins to search for him
Lazaro and Segundo survive by shining shoes on the streets while they search for Santos
They narrowly elude Father O Reilly at an ice cream stand he had previously frequented with Lazaro
They follow a campaign vehicle to Santos s house where a political fundraiser is underway
Santos is giving a speech to his guests when Lazaro impulsively takes a sharpened stake from the garden and uses it as a spear hurling it at Santos s head in front of all of his guests
It narrowly misses
Lazaro makes his escape but Segundo is caught by Santos s security people
Santos questions Segundo and comes to realize that Lazaro is the boy from the jungle and can link him to his long ago crime
Santos sends Segundo to a quarry he owns to serve as an indentured laborer and as a lure for Lazaro
Sure enough Lazaro turns up at the quarry and helps Segundo to escape
Together they head into the jungle intending to return to Lazaro s childhood home by the river
Santos tracks them through the jungle
Meanwhile Father O Reilly travels up the Amazon by boat acting on a hunch that Lazaro might return to his forest home
Lazaro reaches the banks of the river and is reunited with his childhood environment and the wild river dolphins
While walking with Segundo on a forest trail leading to his old home Santos catches up with him grabbing him from behind carrying him into the river where he tries to drown him
But Lazaro is saved when the river dolphins he grew up with attack Santos butting him with their snouts and causing him to drown
Father O Reilly arrives on the scene and is highly conflicted as he feels he should save the drowning man in front of him whose hand is now reaching out for help but chooses to do nothing knowing he just tried to kill Lazaro
Santos slowly drowns from his injuries
Father O Reilly is reunited with Lazaro but ultimately leaves him in the forest from where he came
It is not known what becomes of Segundo but the assumption is that he returns to the city and leaves his friend in the forest
Now legendary among the people of the community Lazaro is said to be seen at times still living in the jungle and playing with the river dolphins while also thought to be able to turn into one himself
The movie begins and ends through the narration of Father O Reilly while at confession and seeking his own forgiveness for letting a man die when he could have saved him

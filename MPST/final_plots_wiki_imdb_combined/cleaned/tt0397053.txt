Setting Invisible War is set in 2072 twenty years after Deus Ex and is based on the premise that a combination of all three of the original game s possible endings occurred
The actions of JC Denton in Deus Ex caused the world to descend into a period of war and economic depression known as the Collapse during which several factions built themselves into world powers
These factions include the World Trade Organization which converted many of the world s remaining metropolitan centers into highly regulated city states The Order a religious order which created a new world religion from elements of all major religions and sociopolitical principles the Knights Templar who advocate the complete prevention of biomodification the Omar a society of heavily biomodified humans possessing a group mind which runs a global black market and wishes to become a transhuman race through biomodification and ApostleCorp which seeks to help JC Denton achieve his goal of biomodifying every human on Earth and thus equalizing the race
While JC Denton is seen by the public as a threat to society these organizations seek to use or eliminate his power to rebuild the world in the way they see fit
In keeping with the series conspiracy theory theme several of the major factions are revealed to be secretly connected the Knights Templar originated within The Order while the WTO and The Order are separate branches of the Illuminati
The story is now told more through character interactions than through game text
Books and newspapers in the game world are still readable though the interface is now modal
The developers placed Invisible War further in the future than its predecessor to give it a distinct setting rather than rehash ing what had come before
Lead writer Sheldon Pacotti stated that the advanced timeline loses a little bit of the frisson of a near future real world setting but is more visibly shaped by time and technology bringing the social and technological issues more into the foreground
At the same time the developers wanted to make the game relevant to current world affairs and focused on themes including terrorism while placing the game in real world locations linked in the public consciousness such as Seattle Washington
Other criteria for locations included both a distinct feel and recognizable landmarks as well as believable hooks for the game s conspiracies and fiction
Story The game begins with Chicago being destroyed in a terrorist attack
Alex D the protagonist and another Tarsus trainee Billie Adams along with several Tarsus leaders are evacuated to another Tarsus Facility
Some time after their arrival the facility is attacked by forces of the Order Church
Alex is contacted by Billie who reveals that she is a member of the Order
She claims that Tarsus is using its trainees as test subjects in a biomodification program and asks Alex to join the Order
Once at the Order base in Seattle they are asked to find out what happened to a group of Order troops sent on a rescue mission to a Tarsus facility
They discover that they defected to the Knights Templar who take a more militant approach to matters than the Order
Over the course of the game Alex goes on a series of missions for the Order the WTO ApostleCorp or combinations of those factions
The missions take them to Cairo Trier Antarctica and Liberty Island New York
During the course of the game they discover that they are a clone of JC Denton the protagonist of the first game with aspirations of creating a perfect global democracy through a bioengineered hive mind
They also learn that the organizations they are working for each desire to rule the world
ApostleCorp seeks to fulfill Denton s vision of the future the Illuminati who control the WTO and the Order want to use Denton s technology to create a benevolent dictatorship and the Templars want to eliminate biomodification entirely and create a global holy empire
Near the end of the game Alex comes into possession of data necessary for any of the factions to take control of the world
Each faction asks Alex to upload the data to their base on Liberty Island
Who rules the world in the end depends on which of the factions the player decides to upload the data to
It is also possible to simply send the data to none of them instead destroying all of their bases on Liberty Island
This allows another faction the Omar to take control of the Earth after allowing the rest of humanity to wipe itself out in various wars

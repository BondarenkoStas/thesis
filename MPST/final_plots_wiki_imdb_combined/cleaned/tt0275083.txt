In 1375 a small diplomatic mission from the Korean kingdom Goryeo travels to Ming China to meet the Hongwu Emperor but they are arrested in retaliation for the death of a Chinese diplomat in Goryeo
They are put in chains and taken across a desert
However Mongol raiders suddenly show up and kill the Chinese soldiers transporting them while killing some Koreans in the process
The Mongols ride off leaving the rest of the Koreans to die of hunger or thirst
The head of the Korean soldiers in the group General Choi Jung takes command because the two diplomats are dead
Later they discover that the Mongols have kidnapped the Hongwu Emperor s daughter so they ambush the Mongol convoy and rescue the princess
Yeo sol a former slave of one of the diplomats defeats the Mongol general Rambulwha in single combat but allows the latter to live and escape
The Koreans flee with the princess determined to return her safely to the Chinese capital Nanjing to atone for their diplomatic failure
The Mongols give chase in the hope of recovering the princess and presenting her to their Khan while the Koreans head towards a coastal fortress the princess tells them about where they expect to find safe haven
Along the way the Koreans pick up some Chinese peasants who are also fleeing from the Mongols
Fighting their way through Mongol search parties the group experiences many internal conflicts stemming from social class love and honour
The lower class soldiers chafe under their poor treatment in comparison to the soldiers of the upper class
They have little confidence in their young general and prefer taking orders from their veteran sergeant Dae Jung
The princess has difficulty adjusting to the rough necessities of her position on the run
Choi Jung and Yeo sol become nemeses competing for the affections of the princess and exchanging blows on several occasions
When the group finally reaches the fortress they are disappointed to see that it is nothing more than abandoned ruins
At the same time the Mongols have caught up with them and have set up a camp outside the fortress
As the Koreans prepare to make a last stand the princess attempts to give herself up to the Mongols in exchange for peace but Yeo sol and Choi Jung stop her
A fight breaks out between the two men and the Mongols resulting in Yeo sol being captured
Rambulwha who is impressed with Yeo sol s skill offers to let the latter join his army but Yeo sol refuses and returns to the fortress to help his fellows
In the final battle the defenders gunpowder traps backfire when the Mongols launch a fire attack and stage a raid on the fortress
Yeo sol sacrifices himself to save the princess while Choi Jung and Rambulwha kill each other
All the Koreans perish along with their Mongol enemies except for Dae Jung
The princess stays with the peasants at the fortress and promises to tell her father of the Koreans sacrifice while Dae Jung builds a makeshift raft and sails back to Goryeo

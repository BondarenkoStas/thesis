While Tom is throwing darts at an apple on Jerry s head Ã  la William Tell a telegram arrives
Though it is meant for his owner Tom reads it himself and discovers that he has been left a million dollars in a will from his owner s eccentric aunt making him ecstatic
Jerry also reads the letter and gets just as happy as Tom
Tom quickly learns why after he reads the telegram again because the telegram has a condition that forbids him to ever harm any living animal especially mice or else he is likely to lose everything
The next day news of Tom s inheritance quickly spreads and he moves into 1 Park Avenue
Although he at first enjoys the attention and wealth he is given Jerry decides to use the telegram s condition against Tom as revenge for tormenting him
He continually follows Tom despite the cat s best attempts to get rid of him and proceeds to take advantage of his freedom through various means including slapping Tom s dickey in his face assaulting him in his limousine eating his sundae and even throwing him out of bed whilst still falling asleep
The next morning after Jerry steals his bathroom towel Tom decides to get rid of Jerry
After a few ideas he eventually decides on hanging a fire exit sign on the window
He strikes a match to start a fire in front of the bathroom door and Jerry promptly jumps out of the window
The cat cheers before sitting down to enjoy his breakfast but when he grabs his napkin however he uncovers Jerry who posts the telegram on the table and eats Tom s breakfast
As a final insult he attacks Tom yet again with the rest of the breakfast material reminding him that as long as the Even A Mouse rule stands he can do whatever he wants to Tom then he once again slaps Tom s dickey in his face
This proves to be the final straw Tom has had enough and becomes enraged and the shocked Jerry realizes that he has pushed the cat too far
Tom furiously grabs the telegram tears it into pieces and even shoves the Even A Mouse proviso into Jerry s mouth literally making and forcing him to eat his words
Jerry swallows it in horror at what is about to happen as Tom leaps into the air with a loud and insane scream before attacking Jerry with the crockery and broken breakfast tray
After a few seconds he breaks the fourth wall that it will cost him his fortune but he is still happy and satisfied and continues attacking Jerry

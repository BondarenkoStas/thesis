Hitman Jef Costello lives in a single room Parisian apartment whose spartan furnishings include a little bird in a cage
A long opening shot shows him lying on his bed smoking when the following text appears on screen There is no greater solitude than that of the samurai unless it is that of the tiger in the jungle Perhaps Costello s methodical modus operandi includes airtight alibis involving his lover Jane
Having carried out a murder contract on a nightclub owner he is seen leaving the scene by several witnesses including piano player Valérie
Their statements are inconsistent but the investigating officer believes Costello is his man based on the witnesses who viewed Costello and his alibi that he was with Jane the whole time
Costello loses a police tail and gets to a meeting point on a subway overpass to get paid by his employers
However instead of getting money he is shot and wounded by a man sent by his employers
Having bandaged his wound and rested he returns to the nightclub and goes for a car drive with the piano player
He is grateful to her but does not understand why she protected him from the police even though she was the key witness to the murder
In the meantime police officers bug his room which agitates the bird in its cage
Upon returning Costello notices some loose feathers scattered around the cage and the bird acting strangely
Suspecting an intrusion he searches his room finds the bug and deactivates it
In the meantime the police ransack Jane s apartment and offer her a deal withdraw your alibi for Jef and we will leave you alone
Jane rejects the offer and shows them the door
Back in his apartment Costello finds himself held at gunpoint by the overpass shooter who gives him money and offers him a new contract
Costello overpowers him and forces him to disclose the identity of his boss a man by the name of Olivier Rey
Following a chase scene in the Métro by several disguised cops and a goodbye visit to Jane he drives to Rey s home which turns out to be the same house in which the piano player lives
Costello kills Rey and drives to the nightclub
This time he makes no attempt to conceal his presence
He even checks his hat but does not accept the hat check ticket
Having put on his white gloves in full view of everyone he walks over to the stage where Valérie advises him to leave
When he pulls out his gun and points it at her she quietly asks Why Jef
and he replies I was paid to
After a moment of tension the audience hears gunshots but not from his gun
Costello falls to the ground and dies
A junior police officer tells Valérie she is lucky the police were there because otherwise Costello would have killed her
But when his boss picks up Jef s gun it is revealed that he had removed all the bullets before entering the club

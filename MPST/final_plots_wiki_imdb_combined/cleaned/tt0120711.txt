In the Beginning tells the story of an important event in the history of the Babylon 5 universe
Ten years before the television series Babylon 5 is set Earth becomes involved in a deadly conflict with the just discovered Minbari race
This war nearly leads to the extermination of the human race but it is mysteriously halted at the last moment by the Minbari leadership for reasons that would remain secret for over a decade
This near destruction of the human race led to the Earth Alliance creating the Babylon space stations as a means of preventing further wars
During the first four years of the Babylon 5 TV series numerous hints about and glimpses of the Earth Minbari War were offered
When the program moved to the TNT cable network for its fifth season a set of television movies were ordered to promote it and Straczynski chose to use the first of these to tell the story of the war he had so often alluded to in previous episodes
The movie opens with a view of Centauri Prime in flames
A man is seen looking out of the window of the Royal Palace looking at the destruction
Two children Luc and Lyssa are seen playing in the royal throne room and looking out of the window watching numerous buildings go up in flames
Their governess finds them and tells them that it s the Emperor s window and that only he can look out of it
The Emperor hears them and tells them to come in front of him
It is then revealed that the Emperor is an aged Londo Mollari
Mollari allows Luc to be Emperor of the Centauri Republic for five minutes during which time he may give any order he wishes
Luc asks for a story of great battles and heroes and villains
Lyssa wants to hear a true story
Mollari decides to give them both what they want and tell them the story of the Earth Minbari War that happened 35 years ago while he was ambassador to Earth
The movie begins before the war when the human race feeling cocky following their defeat of the Dilgar is rapidly expanding into space
Word reaches them of the mysterious Minbari race
Though they are warned by Londo to leave this race alone they seek to research the species first hand
Meanwhile the Minbari Grey Council led by Dukhat have become concerned that the Shadows may have returned to Z ha dum in fulfillment of Valen s prophecy
They are taking a roundabout route to the dark world to investigate when they encounter Earth ships specifically the Prometheus seeking to investigate the Minbari
A misunderstanding then follows
The Minbari ships turn towards the Prometheus and engage their long range sensors to gain more data on the unknown Earth ship
Unknown to the Minbari the intense EMP field generated by their long range sensors has the unexpected side effect of disabling the Prometheus jump engine preventing the Earth ship from retreating
As the Minbari ships draw closer they open their gun ports a sign of respect in their culture
The interference from the Minbari sensors also prevents the Prometheus from determining whether or not the Minbari ships are charging their weapons
The captain of the Prometheus with his jump engines disabled and the Minbari ships approaching with apparent intent to fire misinterprets this as a sign of aggression and opens fire
The Minbari ships are heavily damaged and their beloved leader Dukhat killed
In retaliation the Grey Council announces a holy war against humanity and the Earth Minbari War begins

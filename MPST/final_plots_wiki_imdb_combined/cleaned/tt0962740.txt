Hell Correspondence The medium through which a client contacts Ai Enma has changed over the centuries
Initially clients would write the names of whom they hated on an ema which later changed to sending a letter to the address appearing in a three column newspaper advertisement only visible to those with enough hatred
Once the internet became available people could access the Hell Correspondence website otherwise known as the Hotline to Hell
Soon after the site was adapted into a mobile version that could be accessed from cell phones
Each medium can only be used at midnight by one who harbors a desire for revenge against their object of hatred
Should someone submit the name of someone against whom they bear a grudge or immense hatred and their request is accepted Enma Ai will take them to a realm of perpetual twilight where she offers them a straw doll which is one of her companions with a red string wound around its neck and describe to the client the details of their contract
Should the client pull the string tied around the doll s neck Enma Ai will ferry the target of the revenge straightaway to Hell
However once the client s life has ended he she will also go to Hell and a black crest shaped mark appears on the client s chest to serve as a permanent reminder of their decision to send someone to Hell
However this mark is no guarantee that the person themselves won t be sent to Hell by another client

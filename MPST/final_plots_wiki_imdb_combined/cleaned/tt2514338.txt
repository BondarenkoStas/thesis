In the 1880s Danish Captain Gunnar Dinesen is in Argentina with his teenage daughter Ingeborg who asks him if she can have a dog
He is propositioned by Lieutenant Pittaluga who asks him for permission to take Inge to a dance in exchange for one of his horses
In clumsy Spanish Dinesen refuses stating that Inge is his daughter
When Dinesen warns Inge that Pittaluga is too fond of young girls and she should not go near him she asks why she ever would
Unbeknownst to her father Inge is already involved with a young soldier named Corto
Corto tells Pittaluga and Dinesen about the rumors that Zuluaga an officer who inexplicably disappeared into the desert is leading a group of bandits and wearing a woman s dress
The men tell Corto to go into the desert and bring them something tangible as proof that Zuluaga is still alive
During the night Inge and Corto run off together
Though Pittaluga offers to help retrieve Inge Dinesen insists on going alone
Heading out into the desert he eventually encounters a slain man whispering the name Zuluaga
He later finds a bloodied and dying Corto and asks him where his daughter is before beheading him
Corto appears to have been attacked by some indigenous people wearing white mud
While Dinesen is stooped over Corto his horse hat and rifle are stolen by one of the natives and Dinesen is forced continue on foot through the inhospitable desert
Driven onward in the search for his daughter he continues on in the direction the indigenous man went
Dinesen contends with extreme thirst and possibly begins to hallucinate
As Dinesen wanders through the desert he sees a dog who leads him first to a toy soldier belonging to Inge and then to a Danish speaking elderly woman who lives in a cave
She tells him her husband died of a snake bite
Captain Dinesen tells the woman that he is looking for his daughter and as the conversation unfolds it is gradually revealed that the woman is his daughter
She tells him to come back whenever he likes and he wanders out into the desert again
In the present day a young girl wakes up in a mansion in Denmark and goes to see her dogs
She is distressed by the fact that one dog has been scratching his fur off and the hound keeper tells her it is because he is nervous and perplexed by her long absences
The girl takes the dog for a walk in the woods around her home and finds a toy soldier on the ground
She picks it up and casts it into a pond

Chester MacFarland is an alcoholic con artist traveling in Greece with his young wife Colette
McFarland is wanted by the police back in the U S for running a Ponzi scheme
In Athens a Greek policeman questions McFarland who accidentally kills him during a struggle in his hotel room
A recent acquaintance a young American law graduate and poet named Rydal Keener decides to help them in part because McFarland reminds him of his recently deceased father from whom he was estranged
He helps McFarland and Colette hide the body and leave Athens under false passports procured by his friend Niko a small time hoodlum
Bound together for the foreseeable future the trio take a flight to Crete and install themselves there in a hotel under assumed names
Colette who seems to have a record of infidelity flirts with a smitten Keener in front of McFarland whose jealousy eventually gets the better of him
On a rainy morning while they visit the palace of Knossos MacFarland tries to kill Keener by throwing a pithos at him from above but accidentally kills Colette instead
Both MacFarland and Keener separately flee the scene of the crime undetected and take the same boat back to Athens now more dependent on each other than ever
Back in Athens MacFarland is interviewed by the police and states that Keener murdered Colette
At the same time he hires a contract killer to get rid of Keener once and for all
He is unaware that the hitman whom he pays in advance is in fact a florist whom Keener paid to set him up
Keener goes into hiding from the police while MacFarland procures another false passport and books a flight to Paris
In Paris MacFarland learns from his accomplices in the Ponzi scheme that his enterprises there are no longer lucrative and that the U S authorities may be looking for him
Nevertheless he believes that going back to the States and starting afresh under a new name is the only option left to him
Keener who McFarland had assumed was dead suddenly reappears and blackmails him
Unbeknownst to McFarland Keener is in fact working with the police to get him to confess to Colette s murder
Leaving behind all his possessions except his cash stuffed into his pockets McFarland travels by taxi to Lyon and then on to Marseille where he intends to get a boat or a plane to America
While waiting for the boat however he gets drunk in a bar and is mugged robbed of everything except his overcoat
In his stupor he is arrested and identified by the French police
While in police custody MacFarland gets hold of a guard s pistol fires at him and is shot in turn
As he dies he takes responsibility for Colette s death exonerating Keener
After the police clear Keener of any wrongdoing he promises to go to McFarland s funeral service out of gratitude

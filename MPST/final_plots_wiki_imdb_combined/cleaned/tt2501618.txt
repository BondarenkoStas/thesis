Each episode revolves around Yellow Guy Red Guy and Duck Guy meeting one or several anthropomorphic characters who begin a musical number related to a basic concept of day to day life with an upbeat melody similar to that of a nursery rhyme
As each song progresses it becomes apparent that its moral or message is nonsensical or self contradicting and that the teacher character has ulterior or sinister motives
The climax of each episode typically involves a shock element with use of graphic violence and sometimes other coercive or warped themes
Episode 1 The first episode begins in a kitchen where the main cast is eating breakfast
A singing sketchbook teaches the main characters to get creative singing about childlike activities
The climax of the episode is an exaggerated depiction of creativity in which the puppets dance increasingly erratically and engage in deranged acts like covering a heart in glitter and serving a cake made from viscera complete with shaky camera shots and increasingly frantic music
The video ends with everything seemingly restored to normal and the sketchbook telling the puppets to never be creative again
Episode 2 A talking clock Tony sings about time
The protagonists question the reality of time to Tony s annoyance
Tony then accelerates the passage of time rapidly aging the cast and causing them to decay alive
Red guy becomes old and his fur turns grey while duck guy and yellow guy begin to rot alive with duck guy s eye falling out
The events are revealed to be part of a television programme watched by the three friends although the end implies the rotting was real due to duck guy s eyeball being visible by the television
Also yellow guy s hair is visible during the end credits with maggots appearing to multiply on it
This episode introduces Yellow Guy s father Roy
Episode 3 At a picnic with Yellow Guy and Red Guy Duck Guy kills a butterfly
Yellow Guy distressed flees to a tree and is found by a butterfly Shrignold

The plot takes a sinister turn when the cult explains that he must lose his memories and name
The video ends with Yellow Guy waking up where he started and his friends bringing him an egg which splits revealing a maggot like creature who calls Yellow Guy father and is promptly squashed by Duck Guy
Episode 4 The protagonists are playing a board game
They express their desire to learn about the World and a globe named Gilbert comes to life
He prepares to sing to them but Colin a talking computer randomly begins to sing about how clever he is cutting Gilbert off
Throughout the song Red Guy expresses frustration at his questions not being answered and promptly slams Colin s keyboard

Colin sings about the Three Main Activities of the Digital World viewing different graphs Digital Style and Digital Dancing
These are repeated until a room becomes populated with distorted dancing clones of Colin Yellow Guy and Duck Guy

Various characters led by a steak gives increasingly bizarre and self contradictory advice about eating habits in song

Eventually he becomes irritated and runs off set knocking over the camera
He wakes up in an operating room to find a large tin can eating his organs
Yellow Guy continues following the song and becomes bloated from eating cans of meat labeled with Duck Guy s picture
During the credits sequence Red Guy is seen dressed in a coat and scarf walking away from a phone booth carrying a suitcase revealing he was the one calling throughout the episode
The creators claim that a phone number printed on the phone booth in this video was being called within seconds of the episode s release which at first they would answer and pretend to be characters from the show
Episode 6 Yellow Guy is in bed crying because he misses his friends

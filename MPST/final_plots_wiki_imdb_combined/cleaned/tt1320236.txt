Sir Paul is an art critic and writer who was blinded in a car crash
He lives alone in a large mansion in the UK
He is looking for an amanuensis or ghost writer to help him write his final book an autobiography and interviews several unsuccessful candidates until Jane Ryder applies for the position
Because she is intelligent and forthright Sir Paul hires her and he explains to her she will now be living in the house and introduces Mrs Kilbride the cook and housekeeper
He then goes on to divulge his claustrophobia and terrific fear of the dark despite him being blind and asks that the lights be switched on at exactly the same time as they would be in any normal house
Jane begins to explore the mansion by herself noting how a good amount of the furniture is covered in white dust cloths before stumbling upon a teddy bear with one eye
She picks up the bear and snaps the eye off of its face
A shot of a painting is then inexplicably shown along with the sounds of a child s laughter
They have breakfast together and discuss their pet annoyances with Sir Paul getting disproportionately angry about Jane saying no problem repeatedly
He asks her to bring to his attention anything he does that she finds irritating if any
She then states that his saying poor as an adjective describing it as patronizing
Sir Paul then tells Jane that he can both hear her smile and think
Sir Paul begins dictating his book which he decides to call A Closed Book to Jane while she types on her computer
Sir Paul again gets very angry at Jane for not taking his instructions
After they finish writing Sir Paul asks Jane to buy a puzzle of a specific painting as a favor which she agrees to do
He later asks her to call his agent to deliver the news about his new book being in the works
Jane dials the phone and speaks with someone before telling Sir Paul that his agent is currently out of the country and not available
Things run smoothly until Jane starts changing things ever so slightly like taking paintings out of their frames and turning them upside down
Her true purpose at the mansion starts to become even more questionable when she begins to lie to Sir Paul stating that she had been wearing a red gown when she was wearing jeans and a shirt and sets a few of his books ablaze in the fireplace
Sir Paul begins to question Jane s personal life specifically her love life but she is divulges little and asks that the subject be changed
Sir Paul starts to suspect Jane when she sends Mrs Kilbride home for a week without consulting him
While singing in the bath he keeps hearing strange noises which are really Jane attempting to scare him
While he is in the bath someone turns the light off and then Jane comes in naked and claims that the light is still on to reassure him
She leaves the bathroom and the audience is then shown another shot of the teddy bear followed by a painting of a young girl playing with a teddybear and the sound of children s laughter
Jane s lying and sneaking becomes more and more obvious as she lies to him about Madonna dying and O J Simpson committing suicide
Sir Paul becomes very suspicious when Mrs Kilbride returns to the house and she finds a puzzle that Sir Paul asked Jane to purchase and it turns out to be the wrong puzzle
This particularly matters to Sir Paul as he wrote about the painting in his book and he gets very angry at her and begins to lose trust in her
Jane assures Sir Paul that nothing like this will ever happen again
Later Mrs Killbride calls to inform them that her husband may have lung cancer and that she won t be able to work again for some time
Sir Paul s suspicions are assuaged when a Conservative MP visits his house to persuade him to vote for the Conservatives
Because of her fear of Sir Paul she responds positively to all of his questions and she reads aloud what Jane has written in his book after he insists she do it for him
Fortunately for Jane her transcription of his words on the computer are accurate
Jane later escalates her campaign against him and one day she leaves a suit of armour lying on the floor and displaces several desks and a number of books
She knows that Sir Paul will walk into them which will cause him to trip and fall down the stairs
She then comes back into the house
Sir Paul dials his agent for the first time in the film and finds out that he was in fact at his office the whole time and had never taken a trip
Eventually Sir Paul realizes that Jane is attempting to kill him and he has a confrontation with her in his bedroom
She tells him that her late husband Ralph had once had an art exhibition at a prestigious gallery where he had been severely criticized by Sir Paul
It is revealed that the quick shots of paintings shown throughout the film are in fact the works of her late husband
Due to the subject material of his paintings Ralph had been arrested and accused of being a pedophile
He later killed himself
After comparing Sir Paul to a closed book and declaring that she must destroy him the way he destroyed Ralph Jane shoves him into a wardrobe and she leaves the house with Sir Paul screaming after her
However when she returns to the house out of guilt and because she lacks the capacity to kill someone Jane discovers that Sir Paul has escaped from the closet
He had called Mrs Killbride with a phone that he had forgotten was in his pocket from a previous scene telling her that he had locked himself in the wardrobe
Then Sir Paul points a gun at Jane and explains that Ralph killed himself because he could not stand the truth about himself that he knew what Sir Paul had written about him was true
Sir Paul then confesses that he saw this proxy child abuse in the paintings because he saw his own secret in the paintings
Sir Paul too is a pedophile
He invites Jane to shoot him but she leaves the house instead
As she drives away Sir Paul shoots himself inside the mansion

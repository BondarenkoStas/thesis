The time is 1780 and Horatio Prim is a master tinker
He travels to the Kings Point estate of Tom Danbury with a letter of commendation from Gen George Washington
He plans to present this letter to Danbury hoping it will persuade the wealthy man to let Horatio marry Nora O Leary Danbury s housemaid
Unfortunately Horatio has a romantic rival in Cuthbert Greenway Danbury s butler who is very fond of Nora and intends to prevent Horatio from presenting his letter which Nora has taken for safekeeping
Nora happens to overhear Danbury discussing his part in Benedict Arnold s plot Danbury captures her and hides the commendation letter in a secret compartment of the mantel clock
Danbury s fiancée Melody Allen witnesses the situation and sets off on horseback to warn Washington s army
She enlists Horatio s help but the two of them are mistakenly shot by American troops who are arriving at the estate
Their bodies are thrown down a well and the soldiers ransack the house and burn it to the ground
The souls of the two unfortunates are condemned to remain on the estate until the crack of doom unless evidence of their innocence can be proved to the world
For the next 166 years the ghosts of Horatio and Melody roam the grounds of the estate
Then in the 1940s the estate is restored by Sheldon Gage
When the restoration is finished complete with the original furniture Sheldon invites some friends to spend the night there
Accompanying him are his psychiatrist Dr Ralph Greenway a descendant of Cuthbert as well as Sheldon s fiancée June Prescott and her Aunt Millie
Upon arriving they are greeted by Emily the maid who strongly believes that the estate is haunted
Ghosts Horatio and Melody have some fun with this idea and try to scare the guests especially Greenway whom Horatio mistakes for Cuthbert and hits with a candlestick
The newcomers hold a séance and learn the identities of the two ghosts and of the letter which can free them
They search for the letter but soon learn that not all of the furniture is original as the clock that holds the letter sits in a New York museum
Greenway as a way of atoning for the cruelty of his predecessor travels to the museum to retrieve the letter
However unexpected events force him to steal it
He arrives back at the estate with the state police in pursuit
Horatio uses the curse to his and Melody s advantage by riding in the police car that is supposed to take Greenway to jail the car is thus prevented from leaving the estate until the clock is opened
Finally the letter is found and Melody and Horatio leave the estate to enter heaven each called by a loved one
Unfortunately for Horatio who is met at heaven s gate by Nora he must wait one more day as Nora points to a sign that says Closed for Washington s Birthday

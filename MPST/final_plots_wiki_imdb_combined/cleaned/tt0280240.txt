The Big O is set in the fictional city state of Paradigm City
The city is located on a seacoast and is surrounded by a vast desert wasteland
The partially domed city is wholly controlled by the monopolistic Paradigm Corporation resulting in a corporate police state
Paradigm is known as The City of Amnesia because forty years prior to the story The Event destroyed the world outside the city and left the survivors without any prior memories
The city is characterized by severe class inequity the higher income population resides inside the more pleasant domes with the remainder left in tenements outside
Androids coexist with the human inhabitants of Paradigm City while they are rare they are sufficiently numerous that denizens of the city do not consider them unusual
Several episodes show inhabitants of Paradigm City practicing some form of Christianity people congregate in meeting places with crucifixes prominently displayed
The practice appears to be based on custom because no one clearly remembers any doctrine associated with the practice
A ruined cathedral remains unused although some elderly people occasionally stand in front of it and sing incompletely remembered hymns
In episode 11 it appears that only Alex Rosewater CEO of the Paradigm Corporation that runs the city remembers or observes Christmas
A holiday commemorating the founding of Paradigm City Heaven s Day is observed on December 25
Though citizens decorate with generic Christmas decorations they are ignorant of their original meaning
Dastun mentions that Rosewater had in his possession fragments of a Book of Revelation although neither Dastun nor Roger had heard of it before
Although the textbook definition of memory is a record stored in the brain of an organism the citizens of Paradigm City use the term more loosely Memories can refer to forgotten knowledge records or artifacts from before The Event or partial forms of recollection including hallucinations and recurring dreams
The first season is episodic
Each episode relates a separate instance the resurgence of lost memories and how the citizens cope with their collective amnesia
The final episodes introduce elements that come into play during season two like the discovery of people living outside of Paradigm City the true nature of the Event and something obliquely described as the Power of God wielded by the hand of man
While the majority of the first season s episodes are self contained stories the second season comprises a single serialized story arc
Alex Rosewater becomes a direct antagonist to Roger and a mysterious group known as The Union is introduced containing agents of a foreign power working within the City
Ending The series ends with the awakening of a new megadeus and the revelation that the world is a simulated reality
A climactic battle ensues between Big O and Big Fau after which reality is systematically erased by the new megadeus an incarnation of Angel recognised as Big Venus by Dorothy
Roger implores Angel to let go of the past regardless of its existential reality and focus only on the present and the future
In an isolated control room the real Angel observes Roger and her past encounters with him on a series of television monitors
On the control panel lies Metropolis a book featured prominently since the thirteenth episode with the cover featuring an illustration of angel wings and gives the author s name as Angel Rosewater
Big Venus and Big O physically merge causing the virtual reality to reset
A white flash subsides and the first scenes of the first episode of the series play out
New versions of Dorothy and Angel watch Roger drive down the street as he delivers again his first speech of the series although he is a little hesitant this time
The ending title card We have come to terms appears and the credits roll

Radiant Dawn is divided into four parts each of which begins with a prologue chapter that introduces the situation followed by a series of chapters that is resolved with an Endgame chapter
Part One Three years after the Mad King s War detailed in Path of Radiance Daein the war s instigator and eventual loser and the victorious nation Crimea are still in the process of rebuilding
Although Crimea is ruled by Queen Elincia Daein lacks a proper successor and is instead ruled by the occupation forces of the Begnion Empire
The Daein people are oppressed by the corrupt Begnion senate and imperial soldiers
A group of Daein rebels named the Dawn Brigade headed by Micaiah and Sothe act as vigilantes to provide some measure of hope against the oppressors
After being driven from the capital the Dawn Brigade flees into the northern desert
There they encounter the heron prince Rafiel and the wolf laguz queen Nailah whose people have not been seen in Tellius for millennia
Soon after the Dawn Brigade locates and allies with the late King Ashnard s orphan son Pelleas his scheming and ruthless adviser Izuka and the former general of Daein known as the Black Knight
The group launches a guerrilla war against the occupation army liberating former soldiers of Daein from prison camps and gaining the loyalty of the people
Micaiah s efforts become legendary during these campaigns with the people of Daein dubbing her the Silver Haired Maiden
Word of the plight of the Daein people eventually reaches Empress Sanaki of Begnion
She orders an emissary be sent to Daein to reign in the occupation army
The senate disavows and scapegoats occupation leader General Jarod who is overthrown and killed by the liberation army in an assault on the capital
Unbeknownst to them all Izuka tricks Pelleas into signing a contract known as a blood pact with the head of the Begnion senate Lekain which will kill increasingly large numbers of Daein citizens when triggered
Part Two Word of Pelleas ascension reaches Crimea and Queen Elincia s recognition of Pelleas as Daein s rightful ruler outrages the Crimean nobility
Fear that Crimea s hated enemy is rebuilding creates discontent throughout all levels of Crimean society
A Crimean noble named Ludveck takes advantage of the tension to organize a rebellion in order to claim Crimea for himself
Alerted to Ludbeck s plan the Crimean Royal Knights attack and capture Ludveck s castle
However this is a diversion and Ludveck s troops lay siege Elincia s castle but they are repelled and Ludveck is captured
He attempts to force Elincia to release him by holding her friend Lucia hostage but she is rescued by Ike and the Greil Mercenaries
Ike reveals to Elincia that one of Crimea s nobles Count Bastian purposely left the country in order to draw out the rebels
Bastian paid the Greil Mercenaries to ensure that the rebels were defeated and that the Queen emerged victorious
Before Ike leaves Elincia reveals the Black Knight s return in Daein
Ike is shocked by this revelation as he supposedly defeated the enigmatic knight during the Mad King s War
Part Three When Ike returns to his headquarters he is hired by the Laguz Alliance consisting of the hawk nation of Phoenicis the raven nation of Kilvas and the beast nation of Gallia
Their representative Ranulf explains that Rafiel has revealed that the Begnion senate was responsible for assassinating the previous apostle of Begnion and framing the heron clans for it resulting in their near annihilation
This has led to the newly formed Laguz Alliance declaring war on Begnion
The situation quickly escalates threatening to become a world war that will awaken the god of chaos Yune who will supposedly destroy the world if unleashed
Begnion coerces Daein into preparing to join the war on their side with the blood pact and uses another blood pact to force Kilvas to betray the Laguz Alliance
The Alliance makes major gains in the early months of the conflict aided a great deal by the tactical ingenuity of Ike and his mercenaries
As the Alliance prepares to march south into Begnion s heartland the Begnion central army arrives to block the way
The central army is better equipped than the previous enemies of the Alliance and is led by the highly capable General Zelgius
Zelgius and his army hold back an attempted river crossing by the Alliance and Zelgius defeats Skirmir in single combat severely wounding him
While this is occurring Begnion launches an invasion of Phoenicis and razes its capital to the ground severely weakening the capabilities of the hawk laguz
Seeing the weakened state of the Alliance the Begnion senate orders Daein to enter the war and crush the Laguz Alliance
Seeing no other choice Pelleas orders Micaiah to lead the Daein army south into Begnion
Micaiah attempts to trap the Alliance between her forces and the central army but a lack of concern for her soldiers on the part of the Begnion senate deprives her of accurate information on the size of the laguz forces
Ike is able to lead the Alliance to safety
Zelgius openly loyal to Empress Sanaki in the decades long political Senate Empress power struggle allows the Alliance to escape hinting to Ike that the Empress does not support the war
In response to this the senators have Sanaki s prime minister and father figure Sephiran arrested
The Empress flees the capital of Begnion soon afterward with her royal guard
Now in control of the country the senate orders Zelgius to pursue and destroy the retreating Laguz Alliance and sends one of their number Senator Valtome to enforce order in the army
The Alliance falls back to the borders of Gallia the homeland of the beast nation
Ike is able to lead the Alliance through a perilous volcanic cave network and thereby elude the central army
Undeterred the senate decides to invade Gallia by marching through the neutral nation of Crimea
Begnion demands that Elincia provide them with supplies but the Queen refuses due to her alliance with Gallia and because the earlier rebellion destroyed much of the kingdom s crops
Valtome infuriated by the denial orders the central army to take what it needs from the Crimeans whom he views as subjects of Begnion
Begnion begins raiding Crimean villages for supplies drawing the Crimean Royal Knights into a skirmish
As the Laguz Alliance and the central army prepare to fight a battle on Crimean soil Elincia arrives and places herself in between the two opposing armies
She demands that both sides leave Crimean territory as it is a land of peace
Zelgius leads the central army off of the field of battle an action that enrages Valtome
He orders his soldiers to kill Elincia an action prevented by the Royal Knights and Greil Mercenaries
Back in the central army camp Valtome orders Zelgius to be executed for his disloyalty
This is stopped by the arrival of Empress Sanaki and her royal guard
The soldiers of the central army turn on Valtome who flees with all of the men loyal to the senate
Soon after the Crimeans the Empress men and the Laguz Alliance members sign a treaty and make a pact to defeat the Begnion senate
Civil war breaks out across the Begnion Empire as the forces of the Empress and Senate begin to clash
Unwilling to abandon her supporters within the Empire the Empress demands that the Alliance march on the Begnion capital
However as the now massive army prepares to depart a messenger arrives from Daein demanding the surrender of the Empress to their custody on behalf of the senate
Realizing that they cannot advance with the threat of Daein to their north the Alliance invades Daein
Micaiah and her army defend the border as long as possible but are greatly outnumbered and are defeated
Suffering from battlefield fatigue she returns to the capital to recover
While there she learns from King Pelleas of the true reason why they are fighting and resolves to fight on while the King researches a way to break the blood pact
The Daein army adopts increasingly unorthodox tactics and through this are able to fight against the numerically superior Alliance
Their unshakable belief in Micaiah keeps the morale of the Daein soldiers high
In one engagement Micaiah forces the Alliance to march down a narrow canyon road
She then employs boulders and burning oil to decimate the central army and Royal Knights
When she returns to the capital Pelleas reveals that the only way to end the blood pact is to kill the signers and he orders his own death Micaiah can either do the deed herself order one of their generals to do it or refuse outright
Knowing that Daein remains heavily outnumbered Ike orders the Alliance to assault a major Daein fort in an attempt to finish off the battered nation
The storming of the fort is ended by the arrival of Nailah and Prince Kurthnaga of the dragon laguz nation of Goldoa who have learned of Daein s plight and sided with them
The next day a massive battle ensues and the chaos begins to awaken Yune Micaiah is forced to prematurely awaken her with the galdr of release
Yune s awakening also awakens the goddess of order Ashera
Part Four As punishment for bringing the world into chaos Ashera subsequently petrifies Tellius only the most powerful warriors and human laguz half breeds survive
She decides that humankind is unworthy of survival and must be eradicated and recruits the Begnion senate to this end
Guided by Yune through Micaiah who sides with humanity Ike Micaiah and King Tibarn of Phoenicis lead three groups in a campaign through Begnion to the Tower of Guidance where Ashera lies
Micaiah and her fellow Daeins seek to use the petrification of the world as a means to destroy the blood pact without harming Daein
Each of them run into the Disciples of Order formerly regular men and women who have been empowered by Ashera to stop the protagonists
In separate engagements they confront various senators and Izuka who reveals that Pelleas was not Ashnard s son but an unwitting dupe used to place Daein further under Begnion s thumb
Ike also learns that the Black Knight s true identity is that of the Begnion general Zelgius
In an encounter with Senator Lekain Empress Sanaki asks him why she has been declared a false apostle by the senate
Lekain responds that Sanaki lacks the clairvoyance and foresight traditionally associated with the royal line of Begnion as the trait only effects the eldest child and that her older sister was killed years previously
This revelation is outwardly refuted by the Empress but she inwardly develops a degree of doubt in herself
All three armies eventual convene at the base of the Tower of Guidance
Fifteen heroes are then picked to be Yune s champions against Ashera
Endgame Within the tower the champions defeat the Senator leader Lekain and destroy the blood pacts binding Daein and Kilvas
King Dheginsea of Goldoa also sides with Ashera and is killed by the champions
As they advance further into the tower Micaiah begins to see visions of two men talking in the shadows over many years
In one chamber of the tower Ike and Zelgius duel for one last time with Ike emerging victorious
Zelgius dies content that he has met a swordsman superior to himself
At the entrance to Ashera s chambers the group encounters Sanaki s trusted adviser Sephiran who bars the way to Ashera
Sephiran is revealed to be Lehran a heron laguz of legend who in ages past aided Ashera in defeating Yune and sealed her within the Fire Emblem medallion
Lehran lost his powers when he mated with the first Empress of Begnion but was through this act able to pass on his galdr and gift of clairvoyance to the females of his bloodline the empresses of Begnion
Lehran freely admits during the ensuing confrontation that he was the cause of most of the major events of the past few years
He inspired the Mad King Ashnard of Daein to start a war encouraged conflict between Begnion and the Laguz Alliance and allowed the atrocities of the Daein Liberation War to take place in an attempt to cause the end of the world by creating enough chaos to release the dark god
He did not foresee however the lengths to which heroes would go to save Tellius
Defeated in the ensuing battle Lehran agrees to assist the champions in defeating Ashera if he is spared
In the final chamber Yune pleads with Ashera to allow the world to go on
Ashera refuses however and engages the champions in battle
Ashera proves unable to be killed by mortal weapons so Micaiah and Yune channel their collective energies into Ike s sword allowing him to kill Ashera
After a tearful goodbye with Ike and Micaiah Yune departs from the mortal world
In the aftermath of the conflict the people of Tellius are freed from their petrification
With the Senate defeated the treaty signed by the Alliance comes into effect Begnion and Crimean withdraw from Daein formally ending the war
Lehran quietly slips away into obscurity
Micaiah reveals that she is Sanaki s older sister and that her clairvoyance is derived from their shared bloodline with Lehran
Sanaki asks Micaiah to stay in Begnion but Micaiah desires to remain with her own people in Daein
She assumes the throne of Daein with either Pelleas or the people s approval and ushers in a golden age of prosperity for her kingdom
Tellius begins to recover from a generation of warfare and many of the heroes of Radiant Dawn and Path of Radiance settle down
Hundreds of years later Yune and Ashera combine to again become the goddess Ashunera creator of Tellius
Lehran informs the newly risen goddess that while three centuries have passed since the Wars of the Radiant Dawn the nations of Tellius are once again preparing to go to war

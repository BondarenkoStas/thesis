Two years after the previous game Nathan Nate Drake and Victor Sully Sullivan enter a pub in London to meet with a man named Talbot who is interested in purchasing Nate s ring belonging to his ancestor Sir Francis Drake
The duo accuse Talbot of offering them counterfeit banknotes and a fight ensues
Outside the pub they are subdued by Charlie Cutter Talbot s cohort
Talbot s employer Katherine Marlowe appears and steals Drake s ring
Cutter then shoots Sully and Nate
A flashback 20 years earlier finds a 14 year old Nate exploring a museum in Cartagena Colombia in search of the ring and seeing a younger Sully unknown to him at this point who is working with Marlowe to retrieve the ring
Nate is caught by Marlowe and her henchmen but Sully rescues him from the agents and takes the boy on as his protege
Returning to the present day it is revealed that the meeting was an elaborate set up by Nate and Sully to track down Marlowe with Cutter being a friend of theirs
With the help of Chloe Frazer they trace Marlowe s car to an underground library where they manage to retrieve T E Lawrence s notebook and a map showing Francis Drake s secret voyage to Arabia where he was commissioned by Queen Elizabeth I and the infamous John Dee to search for the lost city of Ubar
Using these items Nate works out that clues to the city s location lie in Crusader crypts in a French chateau and a Syrian citadel
He and Sully head to eastern France and locate the long abandoned chateau in a dense forest
They find one half of an amulet inside the crypt but are ambushed by Talbot who takes the amulet
Suddenly flesh eating spiders appear and kill one of Talbot s men but Nate and Sully narrowly escape them
Talbot and his men then set the chateau on fire
Nate and Sully escape and quickly head to Syria
In Syria Nate and Sully meet up with Chloe and Cutter who have learned that Marlowe is the head of the same order to which Francis Drake belonged which seeks to gain power by exploiting the fears of their enemies
The group finds the second crypt and the other half of the amulet revealing the location of the next clue in Yemen
As they escape Marlowe s men and the citadel Cutter breaks his leg
Chloe and he both decide they can t continue the quest further though Nate promises to do so for them
In Yemen Nate reluctantly seeks the aid of his estranged wife Elena Fisher who despite multiple vain attempts to get them to abandon their quest helps them locate an underground tomb where they discover the location of the lost city within the vast Rub al Khali desert
Back above ground Nate is shot with a hallucinogenic dart and wanders off on his own
He wakes up outside a caf√© with Marlowe and Talbot where Marlowe is shown to have accumulated documents concerning Nate s childhood revealing that Nate started using the name Drake after growing up in the St Francis orphanage upon his mother s suicide and being abandoned by his father
She threatens Nate to reveal the location of Ubar
When Talbot gets news of Sully s location Nate breaks free and gives chase to Talbot throughout the city but is knocked out and kidnapped by Rameses a pirate working for Marlowe who interrogates him for information about Iram of the Pillars and who claims to have captured Sully
Nate escapes captivity and searches for Sully on the pirates captured cruise ship
However he discovers that Rameses lied about having Sully and detonates a grenade causing the ship to start sinking
Before Nate can escape Rameses shoots the ship s glass ceiling causing the tipped over ship to flood and killing himself but Nate manages to escape
Nate is washed ashore back in Yemen
He is reunited with Elena who informs him that Sully was indeed captured by Marlowe s men and taken on a convoy into the Rub al Khali with Sully being forced to lead them to Ubar
They decide to attempt a rescue by sneaking onto a cargo plane due to airdrop supplies to Marlowe s convoy
Nate successfully infiltrates the plane but is discovered on board by Marlowe s men and a shoot out ensues
A large explosion occurs on the plane resulting in a massive decompression which tears the plane apart
Falling through the sky Nate is able to land safely on the desert floor by grabbing hold of a cargo pallet and deploying its parachute
After wandering the desert hopelessly without water Nate encounters Marlowe s men before being rescued by a troop of men on horseback led by a Bedouin named Salim
At the Bedouin s encampment Salim tells Nate that the city of Ubar was doomed thousands of years ago by King Solomon when he imprisoned evil Djinn within a brass vessel and cast it into the heart of the city
Salim agrees to help Nate and leads him to the convoy which they destroy while rescuing Sully
They ride into a nearby sand storm but Nate and Sully lose Salim amidst the dust as they arrive at the gates of Ubar
Upon entering Ubar Nate and Sully come across a water fountain that Nate drinks from
Suddenly Talbot appears with Marlowe and shoots Sully killing him
Overcome with rage and vengeance Nate gives chase and encounters more of Marlowe s men who seem to have been possessed by the Djinn
He experiences vivid hallucinations of his past and of Sully before eventually coming to his senses and finding his mentor alive
The true mystery of what happened to the people of Ubar thousands of years ago becomes apparent when King Solomon cast the brass vessel that had the minerals that caused hallucinations into the depths of the well beneath the city it tainted the water with a powerful hallucinogenic agent which caused Nate to imagine Sully was shot and killed
Nate realizes that the vessel is what Queen Elizabeth had sent Francis Drake to find but after learning the consequences of his quest Drake abandoned his mission
Thus the two figure the brass jar and the drug within is what Marlowe is really after
Nate and Sully search the city and locate Marlowe who is using a winch to pull the brass vessel from the waters
Sully is nearly killed by Talbot but Nate destroys the winch and accidentally blows up the central cistern of Iram causing the city to begin to collapse around them
Marlowe and Talbot corner Nate and Sully but the floor gives way throwing Marlowe into a sinkhole
Despite Nate s attempt to save her Marlowe sinks to her death taking Drake s ring with her
As Ubar collapses Nate and Sully fight Talbot who is shot and falls into the sinkhole
Salim rides in to rescue them as the city is engulfed by the desert sands
Nate and Sully return to the airport in Yemen where Sully gives back Nate s wedding ring which he secretly kept safe when Nate and Elena separated
Elena joins them and Nate offers her his wedding ring again
The two embrace with the promise of a fresh start and the three fly back home on Sully s new sea plane

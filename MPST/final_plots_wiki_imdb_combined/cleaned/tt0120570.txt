The story opens some time after the end of the American Civil War
The Gun Club a society based in Baltimore and dedicated to the design of weapons of all kinds comes together when Impey Barbicane its president calls them to support his latest idea
He s done some calculations and believes that they could construct a cannon capable of shooting a projectile to the moon
After receiving the support of his companions another meeting is held to decide the place from which the projectile will be fired the dimensions and materials of both the cannon and the projectile and which kind of powder they are to use
An old enemy of Barbicane a Captain Nicholl of Philadelphia designer of plate armor declares that the enterprise is absurd and makes a series of bets with Barbicane each of them of increasing amount over the impossibility of such feat
The first obstacle the money to construct the cannon is raised from a number of countries in America and Europe
Notably the US gives four million dollars while England does not give a farthing but in the end nearly five and a half million dollars are raised which ensures the financial feasibility of the project

Verne gives the exact position as 27 7 northern latitude and 5 7 western longitude
The Gun Club travels there and starts the construction of the Columbiad cannon which requires the excavation of a 900 foot deep and 60 foot wide circular hole which is made in the nick of time but a surprise awaits Barbicane Michel Ardan a French adventurer plans to travel aboard the projectile
During a meeting between Ardan the Gun Club and the inhabitants of Florida Nicholl appears and challenges Barbicane to a duel
The duel is stopped when Ardan having been warned by J T Maston secretary of the Gun Club meets the rivals in the forest where they have agreed to duel
Meanwhile Barbicane finds the solution to the problem of surviving the incredible acceleration that the explosion would cause
Ardan suggests that Barbicane and Nicholl travel with him in the projectile and the offer is accepted

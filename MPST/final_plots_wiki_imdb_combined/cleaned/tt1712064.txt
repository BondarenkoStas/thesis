Setting BioShock Infinite is set in 1912 and takes place in a fictional steampunk city state called Columbia named in homage to the female personification of the United States which is suspended in the air through a combination of giant blimps balloons reactors propellers and quantum levitation
The city of Columbia was founded by self proclaimed prophet Zachary Hale Comstock who used his connections in Congress to have the American government build it
The government intended Columbia to serve as a floating world s fair and as a display to the rest of the world of the success of American exceptionalism
The city was launched to much fanfare and publicity at the World s Columbian Exposition in 1893 and was later dispatched to distant shores travelling from continent to continent
Initially seen as the pride of the United States tensions eventually rose between Columbia and the American government
In 1901 against the government s wishes Columbia brutally and violently put an end to the Boxer Rebellion in Peking
This event revealed the floating city as a heavily armed aerial battleship capable of unleashing devastation across the world
The American government subsequently demanded Columbia s return to sovereign soil and in response Columbia seceded from the United States and disappeared into the clouds its location soon lost to everyone else
Free from outside influence Comstock now had complete control over the city transforming it from a floating world s fair to a theocratic police state
Under Comstock s rule Columbia became a militant pseudo Christian utopian society that worshiped him as a divine prophetic figure and the Founding Fathers of the United States as religious icons
Despite Columbia s apparent utopian exteriors it is soon revealed to be a hidden dystopia
Institutional racism and elitism are widespread in the city with white supremacy of the upper and middle classes heavily enforced by the government as law
Despite the drive for racial purity in Columbia people of minority races are purposely brought into the city to exploit as a source of cheap labor
They are the underclass of Columbia and commonly serve as indentured servants
As a result of this subjugation minorities are largely relegated to menial and hard labor with no obvious opportunity for upward mobility
Racial segregation is also heavily enforced within the city to the point where interracial couples face the risk of a public stoning
By the time of the game s events racial tensions have risen to the point where Columbia is on the verge of revolution instigated by the insurgent Vox Populi against the government institutions and the counter revolutionary Founders
The Founders led by Comstock are the prevailing political faction in the city and are the rulers of Columbia
The city s ruling class they are the racist ultra nationalists who seek to keep Columbia s privileges purely for White American citizens while denying the same right to foreigners
The Vox Populi led by Daisy Fitzroy are a rag tag anarchist communist resistance group who fight to give the rights of Columbian citizenship to people of all races and religions
However years of bitter struggle have driven them to fight the opposition more out of blind hatred resulting in more violent and brutal methods
In addition to the internal strife Columbia is ravaged by Tears in the fabric of space time
Being the result of past scientific experiments these Tears reveal alternate universes and allow for interaction with them
While most Columbian citizens regard these Tears as mere curiosity some individuals have exploited the insight offered by them to create radically new weapons and technologies while several others have replicated futuristic music and songs heard from the Tears bringing anachronistic elements into the Columbia of 1912
As with BioShock and BioShock 2 the player is able to locate audio logs Voxophones and film projectors Kinetoscopes that will expand on the history and nature of Columbia beyond those events occurring within the game
Though the game takes place before the events of the previous two BioShock games the question of whether Infinite occurs within this same timeline remains unanswered

She shows that on October 8 1893 Robert Lutece approached Booker on behalf of Comstock requesting that he give us the girl and wipe away the debt referring to Booker s infant daughter Anna DeWitt Booker s AD branding
Booker reluctantly agreed but soon gave chase Comstock barely escaped through a Tear and its closing severed Anna s finger
Comstock then raised Anna as his own daughter Elizabeth her severed finger which caused her to exist in two realities simultaneously is the source of her ability to create Tears
Robert Lutece angry at Comstock s actions convinced Rosalind to help him bring Booker to the reality where Columbia exists to rescue Elizabeth
It is also revealed that Booker in fact willingly agreed to come to Columbia to save his daughter but the mental strain of crossing dimensions caused him to rewrite his own memories such that he combined giving Anna away with his attempt to secure Elizabeth
Elizabeth explains that Comstock will always remain alive in alternate universes as the Luteces have enlisted the Bookers of numerous different universes to try to end the cycle
As stopping Comstock requires intervening in his birth Elizabeth takes Booker back in time to a baptism he attended in the hope of atoning for the sins he committed at Wounded Knee she explains that while Booker changed his mind some Bookers accepted the baptism and were reborn as Zachary Comstock
Comstock later aware of his connection to Booker and sterility from overusing the Lutece Tear machine abducted Anna to provide a biological heir for Columbia
Booker by now joined by other universe Elizabeths at the baptism allows them to drown him at the moment of his baptismal choice thus preventing Comstock s existence

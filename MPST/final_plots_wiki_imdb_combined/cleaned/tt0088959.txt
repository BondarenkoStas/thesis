Due to budget cuts an institution releases the infamous Ethel Janowski a morbidly obese woman whose obsession with food caused her to murder six people into a halfway house operated by the elderly Hope Bartholomew
As soon as Ethel is admitted into the Bartholomew House it becomes clear that she is still delusional convinced that Hope is her dead grandmother and that a fellow patient named Edgar Stanley is the detective who arrested her
As time passes Ethel begins demanding more food and starts refusing to take her medication
One day while Hope is out an orderly feeds the residents dog food and taunts Ethel by slowly eating a chocolate bar in front of her
Ethel snaps and kills the orderly by hanging him with a cord an act witnessed by Edgar
A lieutenant is called in to investigate the death and leaves after questioning Ethel
Edgar tells Ethel that he will keep quiet about what she did in exchange for her desserts
Ethel tries to poison Edgar and when that fails she resorts to stabbing him with four knives
After another visit from the lieutenant Hope catches Ethel eating a bag of pretzels and tries to confiscate them prompting Ethel to bash her head in
Ethel proceeds to murder the remaining resident and one of the institution doctors when he drops by to see why his calls to the halfway house have not been getting through
Ethel then dances with a dog and a knife in the house s backyard and when the lieutenant returns she answers door and laughs crazily as she states Welcome to Bartholomew House
I m Hope Bartholomew and I hope you ll be very happy here

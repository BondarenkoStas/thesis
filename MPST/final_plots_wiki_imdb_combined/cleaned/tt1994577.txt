To many in town the Winklers are seen as a perfect family with Matthew as a perfect husband and wonderful father and Mary as a dutiful wife and mother
However early one morning at the Winkler s home a shotgun blast is heard by the Winkler children
Mary takes the children away in the car on a sudden trip with the children wondering what happened to their father
Concerned neighbors investigate the Winkler home that night finding Matthew dead in a bedroom with a shotgun wound
Fearing the Winkler family has been kidnapped the local and state authorities and FBI issues an Amber alert for the Winklers
Eventually a patrol car finds Mary and her children but they also find a shotgun in her car and apprehend Mrs Winkler
Later the shotgun is identified as the murder weapon
At the station Mary admits she may have shot her husband which shocks the community and her parents in law
At first Mary refuses to divulge more about the incident and refuses to say anything negative about her husband
But her lawyer convinces her to reveal a darker hidden side of Matthew
Mary reveals that Matthew despite his kind pastor image was an angry and abusive man who engaged in physical and emotional abuse when she did something that angered him
She had never revealed this to anyone because her religious beliefs led her to silence
Matthew threatened to hurt or kill her to make her keep quiet
Mary also revealed Matthew tried to tax cheat the money she won in a lottery in order to pay their bills by having her put it in an account at another bank under her name
When the bank calls and asks her and her husband to meet them due to suspicions about the money Mary tells Matthew about it on the night before he is murdered but Matthew has no intention to follow her to the bank citing since the account was under her name it was her problem to deal with it
Mary refuses to reveal more of the abuses she suffered from Matthew to her lawyer but upon learning her parents in law have not given her daughters her letters over what happened making her eldest believe she murdered their father in cold blood Mary finally reveals it in order to not lose custody of her daughters
Mary reveals to the court that Matthew was a hypocrite who forced her to dress up like a hooker before they had sex and made her watch online pornography so they could reenact it even when she didn t want to
The years of abuse and financial situation was gaining its toll on Mary s mental state and what finally broke her was when hours before Matthew was killed he tried to suffocate their baby daughter as he was unable to sleep due to the baby s cries
Unable to stand it any longer in the early morning hours Mary brings out the shotgun and pokes it on her sleeping husband at their bed to wake him up as she wanted to have a serious discussion with him about stopping the abuse
However Mary was standing on a slippery rug which causes her to fall and accidentally pulls the trigger and shoots her husband
Upon realizing what she has done a confused Mary decides to run away with her daughters
After this revelation she tells the jury that despite the abuse she suffered Mary still loves Matthew and never wanted to kill him she just wanted him to stop mistreating her
After jury makes their decision the jury finds Mary not guilty of murder but guilty of involuntary manslaughter much to Mary s lawyers and supporters joy
Throughout the film various people who knew or met the Winklers are interviewed about their opinions of the case
While some refuse to believe that Matthew was an abusive man and Mary was guilty and got away with murder others believe he was and Mary was innocent and was only defending herself and her children
Even Matthew s parents are interviewed who each have their different opinions
While his mother doesn t believe in Mary s story that Matthew was abusive Matthew s father however believes he was but thinks Mary didn t kill Matthew accidentally but purposely as revenge and is willing to forgive her if she confesses the truth

In the opening scene a group of Cuban refugees on a boat sailing for the United States
They are at first met by what appears to be a U S Coast Guard boat with armed personnel
The Guardsmen suddenly kill all the refugees and take several bags of cocaine hidden in the boat
It is revealed that the armed personnel were communist Latin American guerrillas dressed as U S Coast Guardsmen The real Coast Guard eventually finds the boat full of the murdered Cubans off the coast of Florida
The FBI and the Miami Police Department arrive at the docks to investigate the murders
The communist guerrillas eventually land in Florida and exchange the drugs for weaponry from a drug dealer
They are led by Soviet operative Mikhail Rostov
Former CIA agent Matt Hunter Rostov s former adversary is asked by his CIA contact to come out of retirement but he first refuses
However Rostov demands that Hunter be killed before they can begin their operation because Hunter is his former nemesis
Rostov and his gang fail to kill Hunter but destroy his home in the Everglades
Hunter goes to meet his CIA contact and tells him that he will come back Later that night hundreds of additional communist guerrillas invade the beaches of southern Florida
The guerrillas drive away from the beaches on several trucks
The guerrillas begin their assault all over the USA by destroying suburban homes
Another group of guerrillas attack a community center in South Miami killing several unarmed Cuban Americans Meanwhile the FBI has no idea who is behind the attacks
Hunter and the CIA believe that Rostov is behind the attacks
As terrorist acts continue in Miami race riots and general chaos develop within the city
By now the public believes that terrorists are behind the attacks Next the guerrillas attack a shopping mall where people are doing their Christmas shopping
During the attack Hunter comes into the mall and engages the guerrillas
Hunter tracks down and kills the whole group that attacked the mall
The next day National Guard troops are called up while martial law and a curfew are declared Over the next two days Hunter foils a plan to bomb a church and attack a group of people waiting outside a store
In the process Hunter kills Rostov s right hand man Nikko
Soon after Hunter saves a school bus full of children from a bomb that was about to detonate and plants the bomb in the car of the two terrorists which explodes
In order to corner Rostov Hunter coordinates a risky plan The U S Government builds a command center in Atlanta Georgia for the troops
At the command center all 50 state governors and military officials meet how to stop the terror attacks
The FBI arrest Hunter as a vigilante for the killing of the terrorists and is taken to the command center in Atlanta a plan orchestrated by Hunter to be put on the local news aware that Rostov is watching With Rostov wanting Hunter dead he orders all the guerrillas to invade the command center in Atlanta
After breaking into a depot and killing the security guard the guerillas commandeer several armored trucks and launch a massed attack against the command center
When Rostov and his men find the building to be empty they discover that it s a trap As the guerillas prepare to move out the National Guard surrounds the command center supported with M 60 Patton tanks and hundreds of troops using the arrest of Hunter as a trap
A climatic firefight begins as the National Guard and the guerillas engage each other in the streets with casualties to both sides At the command center offices Hunter uses a rocket launcher to blow up an enemy helicopter to cut off Rostov s route of escape
He then enages Rostov s men in a firefight at the offices of the building killing all of them until Hunter comes face to face with Rostov himself in which they exchange fire until they both run out of ammunition which leads to Hunter engaging Rostov in hand to hand combat
Outmatched by Hunter Rostov retreats to another office and arms himself with another assault rifle from a dead guerilla
Hunter approaches Rostov from behind and says it s time Rostov
When Rostov turns around to shoot him Hunter finally kills him by shooting a bazooka rocket at close range blowing Rostov to bits Outside the terror crisis and firefight finally ends when the few surviving guerrillas on the street surrender to the National Guard

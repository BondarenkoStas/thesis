During the First World War two French aviators the aristocratic Captain de Boeldieu and the working class Lieutenant Maréchal set out on a flight to examine the site of a blurred spot found on photographs from an earlier air reconnaissance mission
They are shot down by a German aviator and aristocrat Rittmeister von Rauffenstein and both are taken prisoner by German ground forces
Upon returning to base Rauffenstein sends a subordinate to find out if the aviators are officers and if so to invite them to lunch
During the meal Rauffenstein and Boeldieu discover they have mutual acquaintances a depiction of the familiarity if not solidarity within the upper classes that crosses national boundaries
Boeldieu and Maréchal are then taken to a prisoner of war camp where they meet a colorful group of French prisoners and stage a vaudeville type performance just after the Germans have taken Fort Douaumont in the epic Battle of Verdun
During the performance word arrives that the French have recaptured the fort
Maréchal interrupts the show and the French prisoners spontaneously burst into La Marseillaise
As a result of the disruption Maréchal is placed in solitary confinement where he suffers badly from lack of human contact and hunger ironically the fort changes hands once more while he is imprisoned
Boeldieu and Maréchal also help their fellow prisoners to finish digging an escape tunnel
However just before it is completed everyone is transferred to other camps
Because of the language barrier Maréchal is unable to pass word of the tunnel to an incoming British prisoner
Boeldieu and Maréchal are moved from camp to camp finally arriving in Wintersborn a mountain fortress prison commanded by Rauffenstein who has been so badly injured in battle that he has been promoted but given a posting away from the front much to his regret
Rauffenstein tells them that Wintersborn is escape proof
At Wintersborn the pair are reunited with a fellow prisoner Rosenthal from the original camp
Rosenthal is a wealthy French Jew a naturalized French citizen the son of a Polish father and a Danish mother who generously shares the food parcels he receives
Boeldieu comes up with an idea after carefully observing how the German guards respond to an emergency
He volunteers to distract the guards for the few minutes needed for Maréchal and Rosenthal to escape
After a commotion staged by the prisoners the guards are ordered to assemble them in the fortress courtyard
During the roll call it is discovered that Boeldieu is missing
He makes his presence known high up in the fortress drawing the German guards away in pursuit
Maréchal and Rosenthal take the opportunity to lower themselves from a window by a homemade rope and flee
Rauffenstein stops the guards from firing at Boeldieu with their rifles and pleads with his fellow aristocrat to give himself up
Boeldieu refuses and Rauffenstein reluctantly shoots at him with his pistol aiming for his legs but hitting him in the stomach
Nursed in his final moments by a grieving Rauffenstein Boeldieu laments that their usefulness to society will end with this war
He also pities Rauffenstein who will have to find a new purpose in the emerging social order
Maréchal and Rosenthal journey across the German countryside trying to get to nearby Switzerland
Rosenthal injures his foot slowing Maréchal down
They quarrel and part but then Maréchal returns to help his comrade
They take refuge in the modest farmhouse of a German woman Elsa who has lost her husband at Verdun along with three brothers at battles which with quiet irony she describes as our greatest victories
She generously takes them in and doesn t betray them to a passing German army patrol
Maréchal begins to fall in love with her and she with him but he and Rosenthal eventually leave from a sense of duty to the war effort after Rosenthal recovers from his injury
Maréchal declares his intention to come back for Elsa and her daughter Lotte after the war
A German patrol sights the two fugitives crossing a snow covered valley
The soldiers fire a few rounds but then the patrol leader orders them to cease fire saying the pair have crossed into Switzerland
We last glimpse them from a distance trudging through deep snow their future uncertain

Richard Richie Richard and Edward Eddie Elizabeth Ndingombaba Hitler run the worst guest house in the United Kingdom neighbouring a poorly maintained nuclear power station
The chef is not only unable to cook but is both an idiotic drunkard and an illegal immigrant and eventually leaves due to not being paid and worse of it the waiter is not to be seen as Richie believe that he s in the hospital but obviously not being paid too or insulted by his boss
The guests are thoroughly dissatisfied by the poor service and all decide to leave except for one Mrs Foxfur who lives there
Life seems bleak for Eddie and Richie but things seemingly improve with the arrival of the Nice family with Simon Pegg playing the father
Furthermore the famous Italian actress Gina Carbonara comes to stay in the grotty house while seeking safety from her ill tempered fianc√© Gino Bolognese
However Gino does eventually find her at the guest house as Eddie and Richard had put her name up in lights outside in order to attract more guests
Later Richie finds some fish which fell off a military lorry heading away from the nuclear power station
Richie and Eddie don t realise that the fish had been contaminated by a radiation leak until after they ve fed them to the guests
Hours later with everybody violently ill from the radioactive fish the guests are all projectile vomiting at high velocity and in huge quantities all except for Gina Carbonara apparently the only guest who did not eat the fish
In an act of spontaneous solidarity every guest projectile vomits on him at once forcing him backwards out through a window and off a cliff edge into the ocean
Government agents arrive to hush up the incident and give Eddie and Richie ten million pounds first class tickets to the Caribbean and new identities for both the duo and Gina in exchange for their silence over the leak
The three accept the offer and head to the Caribbean
In the film s final scene Eddie winks to the camera after commenting How lucky he was the only fatality
Otherwise there d be a moral question mark hanging over our escape

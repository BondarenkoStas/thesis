The action in Eternal Darkness is divided between four principal locations
The game skips back and forth through time when the player begins or ends each chapter
The locations include the Forbidden City in Persia a Cambodian temple in Angkor Thom the Oublié Cathedral in Amiens France and the Roivas family mansion with the Ruined City of Ehn gha in Rhode Island United States
Story The plot of the game revolves around Alexandra Roivas who is investigating the mysterious murder of her grandfather Edward Roivas
While exploring his Rhode Island mansion she discovers a secret room containing among other odd items a book bound with human skin and bone
When she reads this book The Tome of Eternal Darkness she experiences a scene in the life of Pious Augustus a respected Roman military commander in 26 BC
Pious is led by mysterious voices to an underground temple where he chooses one of three mysterious artifacts
The artifact transforms him into an undead warlock the Liche and makes him slave to one of three Ancients powerful godlike beings whose Essences are incarnated as the artifacts
As the plot unfolds it becomes clear that Pious is attempting to summon his Ancient into this reality while the powerful fourth Corpse God Mantorok is bound on Earth already apparently helpless to stop it
If this summoning came to pass the Ancient would feast on the bodies and souls of all living beings and cast the universe into the horror of eternal darkness
As she searches for and finds chapters of the Tome scattered throughout the mansion Alex finds herself reliving the experiences of several individuals who have crossed paths with Pious or other servants of the Ancients over the centuries and as a result came into contact with the Tome itself
While many of these individuals meet a sinister fate their cooperation ultimately gathers the Essences of the three remaining Ancients in the mansion
Alex s own ancestors discover the long deserted City of Ehn gha beneath the family mansion and powerful magickal machinery inside
Alex powers up this mechanism with the Ancients essences and summons a rival Ancient to fight Pious
While the two Ancients fight Alex engages in combat with Pious with the aid of the spirits of his victims the souls played in previous chapters ultimately destroying his Ancient s essence
It loses the fight above as Alex kills Pious
Then realizing that the Roivases and their allies have just brought another powerful Ancient into the world Edward s spirit quickly uses the mechanism in Ehn gha to send the other Ancient back where it came from
He expresses pride in his granddaughter before he disappears
After completing the game under all three alignments it is revealed that all three Ancients have been destroyed All at once separate and simultaneous for the universe is made of many timestreams many possibilities all in harmonious synchronicity
Because he was bound and not powerful enough to stop Pious Augustus himself Mantorok manipulated the Roivas family into completing the work for him
He orchestrates the deaths of all three Ancients in separate timestreams and then connects them all resulting in the annihilation of all three alignments
In the end only the corpse god Mantorok is still alive festering in its tomb

The Ancients The Ancients are depicted as godlike beings that existed on Earth before humanity
The three Ancients that Pious may align with were expelled from this universe and Pious works to bring about the return of his Ancient
The featured Ancients are Ulyaoth whose powers focus on magick and the dimensional planes his creations and spells are tinged blue
Ulyaoth s form is reminiscent of a jellyfish
Xel lotath whose powers focus on the mind and insanity her underlings and enchantments are tinged green and have an affinity for affecting sanity
Xel lotath has an eel like lower body with four slender arms connected to a torso with a large eye in the center
Chattur gha whose powers focus on physical strength and matter his troops and powers are tinged red
Chattur gha is crustacean like in appearance and has two large claws
Mantorok is described as the Corpse God and the God of Chaos and is the only Ancient known to have a physical presence on Earth
Its minions are tinged black and its magick is purple
Mantorok is a massive amorphous being with countless eyes and mouths somewhat reminiscent of a shoggoth
The murals of its temple depict it as once having a more defined but still very grotesque shape
Mantorok appears to be in a position of both superiority and inferiority to the other Ancients depending on context
It is described as the Keeper of the Ancients and it s implied that Mantorok alone binds the other three Ancients and traps them outside of reality
Maintaining equilibrium among them and ensuring that they are bound to fight against and destroy one another
However due to a powerful binding spell cast by Pious it has been weakened and its powers over the others has been waning for eons
A fifth alignment colored yellow was confirmed to be the alignment of another Ancient that was not included in the game
In game yellow appears on unaligned runes and disintegrating enemies and was responsible for the cursing of Anthony
Fan theories surrounding the obscure fifth alignment and Montorok suggest that while Mantorok would have been in a position of superiority to the primary other three the unused yellow deity would have been in a position of inferiority to them but while also being superior to Mantorok
However the exclusion of the fifth alignment could be the reason behind Mantorok fulfilling both superior and inferior roles at the same time in the plot

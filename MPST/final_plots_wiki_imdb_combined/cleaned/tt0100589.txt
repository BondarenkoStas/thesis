Sam is a medical student performing an experiment on Shakma a baboon at a med school run by Professor Sorenson
His experimental drug is supposed to make the creature less aggressive but it ends up having the opposite effect and Sam must euthanize the animal
Sorenson wants to perform an autopsy so orders Sam not to cremate the animal
Sam fond of the beast merely sedates it for the moment
Thus Shakma remains alive and highly aggressive unbeknownst to all
That night Soreson organizes a live action role playing game for Sam and his friends Gary Bradley and Richard and love interest Tracy
The objective of the game is to reach Richard s baby sister Kim on the top floor
The players are issued walkie talkies to communicate with each other but the communications must go through Sorenson
As the game begins Shakma wakes up escapes and kills Sorenson
With the game master dead the players can no longer communicate
The doors to the offices are all locked so the telephones are inaccessible
Shakma is ultimately burned to death by the final surviving teenager

The world of Innocence is divided between the divine world of Devaloka and the lower human world of Naraka
As Devaloka needed human souls to survive the Sensus general Asura decided to use the Manifest an artifact created by the ancient Primordial Giant to merge Devaloka and Naraka
This plan was opposed by many leading to war between Sensus and Ratio
Asura was aided by the Devalokans Inanna Orifiel and Sakuya his sentient sword Durandal and his dragon companion Vrtra
Asura eventually won defeating the Ratio general Hypnos in battle
Before he could use the Manifest Inanna betrayed and stabbed him with Durandal
He kills her before he dies leaving the unification of Devaloka and Naraka unfinished
Most of Devaloka s population is killed in the process with the others eventually dying years later
In the present Naraka is governed by the imperial capital of Regnum and the western country of Garam who are in a state of war
Added to this is the emergence of avatars Devalokans reincarnated in human form who hold supernatural powers
They are hunted and inducted into Regnum s military and used for experimentation or as front line troops in the war
The story begins when Luca Milda the reincarnation of Asura encounters another avatar Illia Animi an avatar of Inanna
She is being chased by agents of Regnum
Luca decides to protect her awakening his supernatural powers
The two are eventually captured and forced to become fighters on the front lines along with swordsman Spada Belforma the reincarnation of Durandal
During their time as prisoners Luca develops a relationship with Chitose Cxarma who is a reincarnation of Sakuya and retains her former self s deep love for Asura
Luca Illia and Spada eventually escape briefly encountering the mercenary Ricardo Soldato who is a reincarnation of Hypnos
The three are eventually joined by Ricardo along with Ange Serena and Hermana Larmo the respective reincarnations of Orifiel and Vrtra
As they travel across the war torn land they are confronted by avatars in the service of multiple nations and Arca a cult made up of avatars led by a woman known as Mathias
Chitose joins Arca to further their cause of a utopia for avatars and tries to persuade Luca to join causing a rift between them
The conflicts between the groups is further inflamed as more people regain their memories as warriors of Sensus or Ratio sparking old conflicts
In their adventures the group works to end the fighting and learn about their past lives
When the full truth is revealed they decide to fulfill Asura s wishes and unite the two worlds
This brings them into conflict with Mathias who is revealed to be the incarnation of Asura s wrath at being betrayed and now wishes to destroy both Devaloka and Naraka
Chitose consumed by Sakuya s love for Asura helps Mathias in her task
The party confront Mathias and Chitose in Devaloka s ruined capital where the Manifest is hidden
They defeat Mathias and Chitose kills herself in a fit of despair
Luca then proceeds to use the Manifest to merge Devaloka and Naraka nullifying the avatars powers and lessening the chance of future conflicts
The group then returns to their normal lives

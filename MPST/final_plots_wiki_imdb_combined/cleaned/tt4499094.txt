Alex a teenager is on the last ferry heading to Edwards Island for a weekend party
She is accompanied by Ren her friend and frequent drug user and Jonas her new stepbrother
Alex and company soon meet Clarissa Alex s late brother Michael s ex girlfriend and Nona Clarissa s best friend and Ren s love interest
After camping on the beach Alex Ren and Jonas explore the nearby caves where it is rumored certain radio frequencies cause supernatural events
In a small cavern Alex tunes and unexpectedly forms a rift
A voice answers and the two experience visions and pass out
Jonas then wakes Alex in front of Harden Tower
They get a call from Ren who passed out in the woods and Clarissa then calls from Fort Milner the decommissioned military fort on the island
The calls are cut off and both walk into the forest
They discover a small house turning off the main switch to a lamp glowing red and briefly plays a ukulele tune that Jonas seems to recognize before the streetlights jolt
They then take a cable car to a campground with Jonas passionately asks about Michael
They find the grounds abandoned and time supernaturally repeats twice
The radio then talks again but time loops to Jonas gone and a figure taking her reflection appears and communicates
Time corrects when Alex plays a magnetophone
They spot Nona claiming she saw an alternate Jonas and Alex redirecting her to Harden Tower to find Clarissa
Alex and Jonas start to befriend another and they find Ren but time loops again to exhibit him doing strange activity only to find him gone when fixed
They find him possessed which creates another rift that knocks him out
Ren wakes up and goes to Harden Tower and Jonas and Alex go to Fort Milner to rescue Clarissa
Alex then uses the radio on a light in which a voice states a game and a door unlocks
While inside Jonas is trapped and Alex s reflection appears in a mirror giving Alex advice
After this they find the backdoor combination and leave
A ghost then questions them and possesses Jonas revealing that the ghosts are in fact the passengers of a submarine ripped into an alternate dimension
Alex creates a third rift that wakes Jonas
Both find Clarissa but time loops to her hanged and repeats to her falling to her death
It then corrects to her gone
Nona Alex Jonas and Ren meet at Harden Tower where Jonas blames Ren
The feud subsides and Alex brings one of the others to find a key in an office where Jonas apologizes
They break in and find the key and two radios capable of unlocking locks on the island as well as a letter from the island s former resident detailing the existence of 12 beacons hidden on the island
They then find Clarissa unconscious where she remembers Milner
The group then meet up in the boardwalk where Clarissa blames Alex for everything and Michael s death but time loops Alex and her companion back to the office
On the way back time loops to a year ago as Alex sees Michael and Clarissa and hangs out
She loops back unconscious
The group then goes to an estate to steal a boat and go home
The radio unlocks the gate and they search the estate
Soon after Alex finds the estate with the bodies of Nona Clarissa Jonas and Ren
A possessed Clarissa informs Alex that the test is a hide and seek game in which she passes
Alex s reflection again appears in a mirror
The group then wakes to find Clarissa in a bomb shelter
They find a schematic that details how to fix the tear Tranposing onto the other side and tuning within
Jonas and Alex get to the hill but time loops to where Nona informs that Ren died and loops to reveal different causes of his Death
A ghost then possesses Jonas and tells her that Clarissa can t be saved and bargains but Alex declines
The loops continuously keep repeating until Alex comforts Nona grieving Ren s death correcting the loop
Alex and Jonas then trek to the lookout post as Nona and Ren stand by to unlock the bomb shelter
As they conference Jonas fears the possibility of a reset and thanks Alex for the time they spent
After collecting a series of notes and letters time loops Alex a year ago again in the middle of a conversation with Michael and then corrects at the end
Alex and Jonas then meet up with Nona and Ren at the bomb shelter and Alex and Jonas go in
Finding a possessed tape player the frequency sends Alex to the rift s side
Going to the rift s cave she tunes a rift that sends her into a void
Encountering the possessed Clarissa she is warned that she will die if the rift is closed and time will loop infinitely but Clarissa will be kept if she goes through the portal
Alex can then leave erasing Clarissa from existence close the portal herself trapping her with the ghosts or if she has found enough letters Alex can appeal to the crew members directly convincing them to let both Clarissa and herself go
Going through various loops the reflection figure is revealed to be Alex herself
She then loops back to a conversation to Michael who admits that he and Clarissa are planning to move
Time then corrects
Alex then wakes up with Jonas Nona Clarissa and Ren on the ferry back home with Jonas informing her that whatever she did fixed the rift and that everything is normal
Everyone then reveals that for a limited period they revisited past memories
They then swear to not tell anyone about their experiences and all decide to do leisure to forget
Nona takes a final group picture
Epilogue and endings In the epilogue Alex reveals that she had told her mom that she was going to sleepover at a friend s house
The ending can change based upon actions made in the game with the layout of the picture itself changing as a consequence
Clarissa s friendship with Alex and Michael can be either preserved or destroyed or she can be sacrificed to the rift with no one remembering Clarissa except Alex herself
If she is saved and depending on the actions she will either flunk or continue English
Ren will either date or not date Nona depending on Alex s actions
However he moves to a college out of town
Nona goes to a ballet school and depending on Ren she will be in a long distance relationship
Jonas s relationship with Alex can be either preserved and destroyed depending
Alex can still bond somewhat distantly with Jonas with him residing with his biological father instead of Alex s mother if so chose
Michael can be revived through time looping and puzzles
If so Michael will replace Jonas in the game and Jonas and Alex will cease to be step siblings
The player s actions can either destroy or preserve Michael s relationship with Clarissa
Delivering a statement on her experience Alex can ether go to college in or out of her hometown or take time off depending on a choice the player makes during the epilogue
Thereafter in a swift and mysterious turn of events the screen flickers and Alex tells the player she is going to meet up with Clarissa Ren and Nona to go to Edward s Island and she is picking up Jonas who she never met before the screen flickers to black revealing that the infinite loop is in effect
In the Game ending Alex Jonas and Ren are near a supermarket before they go to the ferry when Ren tells her to tune in to a frequency which plays a song from the soundtrack before they hear a message from a future Alex before she entered the cave to close the rift
Depending on the message and how the player responds throughout the resulting conversation they can end up not going to the island preventing the loop

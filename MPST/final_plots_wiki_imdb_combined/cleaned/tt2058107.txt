During the Second World War Eric Lomax is a British officer who is captured by the Japanese in Singapore and sent to a Japanese POW camp where he is forced to work on the Thai Burma Railway north of the Malay Peninsula
During his time in the camp as one of the Far East prisoners of war Lomax is tortured by the Kempeitai for building a radio receiver from spare parts
The torture depicted includes beatings rape and waterboarding
Apparently he had fallen under suspicion of being a spy for supposedly using the British news broadcast receiver as a transmitter of military intelligence
In fact however his only intention had been to use the device as a morale booster for himself and his fellow prisoner slaves
Years later and still suffering the psychological trauma of his wartime experiences with the help of his wife Patricia and best friend Finlay Lomax decides to find and confront one of his captors who had escaped prosecution as a war criminal
Lomax returns to the scene of his torture after he has tracked down Japanese secret police officer Takashi Nagase in an attempt to let go of a lifetime of bitterness and hate
When he finally confronts his former captor he first asks questions similar to how his captors interrogated him years before
The situation builds up to he nearly whacks Nagase but instead breaks furniture in anger
Soon after Lomax pushes the officer into a human cage where many POWs were previously kept
Nagase soon reveals that the Japanese were brainwashed into thinking the war would be a victorious one for them and how he never knew the high casualties caused by the Imperial Japanese Army
Lomax eventually frees Nagase and throws his knife into the nearby river
He then returns to Britain
After an indefinite period of time Lomax returns with his wife Patricia to Thailand
He meets up with Nagase once again and after an apology which he accepts the two become friends
The epilogue tells that Lomax and Nagase stayed friends until their deaths in 2011 and 2012 respectively

Sally Brown comes home and tells Charlie Brown that she is never going to school again out of frustration with opening her locker The next day Charlie promises he will help with her locker
He tells her that some lockers are a little difficult and touchy and she needs to make sure the numbers are just right
But Sally tells him that is not the problem the problem is she cannot reach it to open it
He does not know what to say so Sally brings him into her classroom for something else to use him as her show and tell presentation much to his embarrassment
After this Charlie sees a poster that says Student Body President Election
Linus van Pelt thinks that would be a good job for Charlie but Lucy van Pelt thinks Linus would be the better candidate
Also running is a student named Russell Anderson
Linus runs for the office with a vigorous and enthusiastic campaign taking an early lead in the polls
Unfortunately he suffers a setback when during his last address to the student body he decides to ad lib a mention of The Great Pumpkin
Nonetheless he wins the election by one vote 84 to 83 the deciding vote cast from Russell who has decided that Linus is in fact better for the job
Following his victory Linus goes to the principal with the intention of keeping his campaign promises and laying down the law only to be taken aback with the realization that he is still strictly subordinate to the faculty and in fact like most student government positions has no real power
After he reveals this to Sally then walks away sheepishly Sally has a fit and accuses him of selling out like all other politicians
She then kicks the bottom of a locker and walks away just to have it open and be Charlie Brown s

In the year 1682 in the reign of James II one of the King s enemies was Lord Linnaeus Clancharlie Marquis of Corleone who had remained faithful to the English republic and had emigrated to Switzerland
Upon the baron s death the King arranged the abduction of his two year old son and legitimate heir Fermain
The King sold Fermain to a band of wanderers called Comprachicos criminals who mutilate and disfigure children who are then forced to beg for alms or who are exhibited as carnival freaks
Confirming the story is a message in a bottle recently brought to Queen Anne
The message is a final confession from the Comprachicos written in the certainty that their ship was about to founder in a storm
The message explains how they renamed the boy Gwynplaine and abandoned him in a snowstorm before setting to sea
David Dirry Moir is the illegitimate son of Lord Linnaeus

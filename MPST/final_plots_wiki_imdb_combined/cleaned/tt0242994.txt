After three years away the actress Camille returns to Paris in an Italian troupe run by her lover Ugo who is touring Europe with an Italian language production of a minor Pirandello play
Camille is nervous because she still has feelings over leaving her lover Pierre who she tracks down in a park
He seems unchanged and has still not finished writing his doctoral thesis on Martin Heidegger
Ugo meanwhile is pursuing his private search for a lost play by Goldoni and in a library meets the attractive Dominique who tells him to try a collector
The collector sends him to the private library inherited by Dominique s mother who warns him that books have disappeared
She is happy for him to browse and Dominique helps him
When she takes him to her bedroom however her jealous half brother Arthur intervenes
Dominique warns Ugo that it is Arthur who steals books to sell
Pierre asks Camille and Ugo to dinner at his flat with his lover Sonia which proves a disaster as the nervous Camille drinks too much and the jealous Ugo mocks Pierre
When Camille goes round next day to apologise to Sonia the two women begin to form a rapport
However Sonia is being pursued by Arthur and in a bar Camille sees him trying to embrace her
In fact he is taking an impression of her very valuable diamond ring which he later replaces with a worthless duplicate
In despair at this deceit Sonia asks Camille if she will help
She goes round to Arthur s flat and offers him a simple deal she will either spend the night with him or walk out on the spot
He opts for the night and once he is asleep she searches until she finds the ring in the kitchen
Now able to be friends with Sonia Camille is still worried that she has not closed things with Pierre
When she goes to see him he locks her in a room and she escapes by a skylight
Ugo then calls on Pierre and challenges him to a duel place and weapons to be his choice
When Pierre accepts he finds that the place is over the flies in the theatre and the weapons are a bottle of vodka each
As Pierre is the first to fall over Ugo wins
In the meantime Dominique has found the Goldoni play not in the library but in the kitchen among her mother s cookbooks
When she brings it to Ugo roaring drunk after his duel he says it is so valuable that she must keep it and just give him a photocopy
Camille turns up with the ring and offers it back to Sonia who says Camille has earned it and must keep it
Reunited and now rich Camille and Ugo look forward to the next stop on their tour

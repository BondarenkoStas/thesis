Mole meets Rat With the arrival of spring and fine weather outside the good natured Mole loses patience with spring cleaning
He flees his underground home emerging to take in the air and ends up at the river which he has never seen before
Here he meets Rat who at this time of year spends all his days in on and close by the river
Rat takes Mole for a ride in his rowing boat
They get along well and spend many more days boating with Rat teaching Mole the ways of the river
Toad One summer day Rat and Mole disembark near the grand Toad Hall and pay a visit to Toad
Toad is rich jovial friendly and kind hearted but aimless and conceited he regularly becomes obsessed with current fads only to abandon them abruptly
Having recently given up boating Toad s current craze is his horse drawn caravan
He persuades the reluctant Rat and willing Mole to join him on a trip
Toad soon tires of the realities of camp life and sleeps in the following day to avoid chores
Later that day a passing motorcar scares the horse causing the caravan to overturn into a ditch
Rat threatens to have the law on the car driver while Mole calms the horse but Toad s craze for caravan travel is immediately replaced by an obsession with motorcars
Badger Mole wants to meet the respected but elusive Badger who lives deep in the Wild Wood but Rat knowing that Badger does not appreciate visits tells Mole to be patient and wait for Badger to pay them a visit himself
Nevertheless on a snowy winter s day while the seasonally somnolent Rat dozes Mole impulsively goes to the Wild Wood to explore hoping to meet Badger
He gets lost in the woods sees many evil faces among the wood s less welcoming denizens succumbs to fright and panic and hides trying to stay warm among the sheltering roots of a tree
Rat finding Mole gone guesses his mission from the direction of Mole s tracks and equipping himself with two pistols and a stout cudgel goes in search finding him as snow begins to fall in earnest
Attempting to find their way home Rat and Mole quite literally stumble across Badger s home Mole barks his shin on the boot scraper on Badger s doorstep
Badger en route to bed in his dressing gown and slippers nonetheless warmly welcomes Rat and Mole to his large and cozy underground home providing them with hot food and dry clothes
Toad and motorcars Badger learns from his visitors that Toad has crashed seven cars has been in hospital three times and has spent a fortune on fines
Though nothing can be done at the moment they resolve that when the time is right they will make a plan to protect Toad from himself they are after all his friends and are worried about his well being
With the arrival of summer Badger visits Mole and Rat to take action over Toad s self destructive obsession
The three of them go to Toad Hall and Badger tries talking Toad out of his behaviour to no avail
They put Toad under house arrest with themselves as the guards until Toad changes his mind
Feigning illness Toad bamboozles the Water Rat and escapes
Badger and Mole are cross with Rat for his gullibility but draw comfort because they need no longer waste their summer guarding Toad
However Badger and Mole continue to live in Toad Hall in the hope that Toad may return
Meanwhile Toad orders lunch at The Red Lion Inn and then sees a motorcar pull into the courtyard
He steals the car drives it recklessly and is caught by the police
He is sent to prison for 20 years
Toad escapes from prison In prison Toad gains the sympathy of the gaoler s daughter who helps him to escape disguised as a washerwoman
Though free again Toad is without money or possessions other than the clothes upon his back
He manages to board a railway engine manned by a sympathetic driver which is then pursued by a special train loaded with policemen detectives and prison warders
Toad jumps from the train and still disguised as a washerwoman comes across a horse drawn barge
The barge s female owner offers him a lift in exchange for Toad s services as a washerwoman
After botching the wash Toad gets into a fight with the barge woman who tosses him into the canal
In revenge Toad makes off with the barge horse which he then sells to a gypsy
Toad subsequently flags down a passing car which happens to be the very one he stole earlier
The car owners not recognising Toad in his disguise permit him to drive their car
Once behind the wheel he is repossessed by his former passion and drives furiously declaring his true identity to the passengers who try to seize him
This leads to the car landing in a horse pond after which Toad flees once more
Pursued by police he runs accidentally into a river which carries him by sheer chance to the house of Rat
Recapture of Toad Hall Toad now hears from Rat that Toad Hall has been taken over by weasels and stoats from the Wild Wood who have driven out Mole and Badger
Although upset at the loss of his house Toad realises what good friends he has and how badly he has behaved
Badger then arrives and announces that he knows of a secret tunnel into Toad Hall through which the enemies may be attacked
Armed to the teeth Badger Rat Mole and Toad enter via the tunnel and pounce upon the unsuspecting Wild Wooders who are holding a celebratory party
Having driven away the intruders Toad holds a banquet to mark his return during which he behaves both quietly and humbly
He makes up for his earlier excesses by seeking out and compensating those he has wronged and the four friends live out their lives happily ever after
Short stories In addition to the main narrative the book contains several independent short stories featuring Rat and Mole
These appear for the most part between the chapters chronicling Toad s adventures and are often omitted from abridgements and dramatizations
The chapter Dulce Domum describes Mole s return to his home accompanied by Rat in which despite finding it in a terrible mess after his abortive spring clean he rediscovers with Rat s help a familiar comfort
The Piper at the Gates of Dawn tells how Mole and Rat search for Otter s missing son Portly whom they find in the care of the god Pan
Finally in Wayfarers All Ratty shows a restless side to his character when he is sorely tempted to join a Sea Rat on his travelling adventures

One thousand years have passed since the Seven Days of Fire an apocalyptic war that destroyed civilization and created the vast Toxic Jungle a poisonous forest swarming with giant mutant insects
In the kingdom of the Valley of the Wind a prophecy predicts a saviour clothed in blue robes descending onto a golden field to join bonds with the great Earth and guide the people to the pure lands at last
Nausicaä the princess of the Valley of the Wind explores the jungle and communicates with its creatures including the gigantic armored trilobite like creatures called Ohm
She hopes to understand the jungle and find a way for it and humans to co exist
One night during a visit by the Valley s swordsmaster Lord Yupa a cargo aircraft from the kingdom of Tolmekia crashes in the Valley
Nausicaä tries to rescue a passenger the wounded Princess Lastelle of Pejite who pleads with Nausicaä to destroy the cargo before dying
The cargo is an embryo of a Giant Warrior one of the lethal bioweapons that caused the Seven Days of Fire
The Tolmekians a military state seized the embryo and Lastelle from Pejite but their plane was attacked by mutant insects and crashed
One of the insects emerges wounded from the wreckage and seems poised to attack the frightened villagers but Nausicaä uses a small bullroarer to calm it and guides it away from the Village on her jet powered glider
The next morning Tolmekian troops led by Princess Kushana and Officer Kurotowa kill Nausicaä s father and take the Giant Warrior embryo
Kushana plans to mature the Giant Warrior and use it to burn the Toxic Jungle
Nausicaä kills several Tolmekian soldiers before Yupa intervenes
Kushana announces her decision to leave for the Tolmekian capital with Nausicaä and five hostages from the Valley
Before they leave Yupa discovers a secret garden of jungle plants reared by Nausicaä according to Nausicaä s findings plants that grow in clean soil and water are not toxic but the jungle s soil has been tainted by humankind
An agile Pejite interceptor shoots down the Tolmekian ship carrying Kushana and her detachment
It crash lands in the jungle disturbing several Ohm which Nausicaä soothes
She leaves to rescue Asbel the Pejite pilot and twin brother of Lastelle but both are swallowed by quicksand and arrive in a non toxic area below the jungle
Nausicaä realizes that the jungle plants purify the polluted topsoil producing clean water and soil underground
Nausicaä and Asbel return to Pejite but find the capital ravaged by insects
A band of surviving Pejites reveal that they lured the creatures to eradicate the Tolmekians and are doing the same in the Valley to recapture the Giant Warrior
They capture Nausicaä not allowing her to warn the village about the incoming attack but with the help of Asbel and his mother Nausicaä escapes on a glider
While flying home she finds a team of Pejite soldiers using a wounded baby Ohm to lead a furious herd of thousands of Ohm into the Valley
The Tolmekians deploy tanks and later the Giant Warrior against the herd but their tanks firepower cannot stop the Ohm and the Giant Warrior hatched prematurely disintegrates
Nausicaä liberates the baby Ohm and gains its trust
Her dress stained by its blue blood she and the baby Ohm stand before the raging herd and are both run over killing Nausicaä
The herd calms and the Ohm use their golden tentacles to resuscitate her
She walks atop the hundreds of golden Ohm tentacles as through golden fields revealing Nausicaä to be the saviour from the prophecy
The Ohm and Tolmekians leave the Valley and the Pejites remain with the Valley people helping them to rebuild
Meanwhile deep underneath the Toxic Jungle a new non toxic tree sprouts next to Nausicaä s lost aviation goggles

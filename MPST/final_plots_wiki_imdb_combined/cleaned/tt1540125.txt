The galactic community has since lived in fear of another possible invasion
Meanwhile a human supremacist organization called Cerberus believes that humans deserve a greater role in the galactic community and supports the principle that any methods of advancing humanity s ascension are entirely justified including illegal experimentation and terrorist activities

Plot One month after the events of Mass Effect the SSV Normandy is patrolling for geth resistance when it is suddenly attacked by an unknown vessel forcing the crew to abandon ship
After pushing Joker into the final escape pod Shepard is blasted into space and dies via asphyxiation after a suit breach
His her body is pulled into the orbit of a nearby planet and recovered by Cerberus who begin the Lazarus Project with the sole purpose of bringing Shepard back to life
After two years Shepard is revived on an operating table and escapes a research station under attack by its own security mechs alongside Cerberus operatives Jacob Taylor and Miranda Lawson
Shepard is brought to meet the Illusive Man who reveals that entire populations of human colonies have been disappearing all over the galaxy
Now working for Cerberus Shepard is sent to investigate a recently attacked colony where he she finds clues about the Reapers working by proxy through an insectoid species called the Collectors
The Illusive Man explains that the Collectors reside beyond the Omega 4 Relay a place from which no ship has ever returned
Shepard is given command of a new starship the Normandy SR 2 piloted once again by Joker and equipped with an onboard AI named EDI and begins to assemble a team to stop the Collectors
Shepard recruits Mordin Solus former squad member Garrus Vakarian Jack and Grunt before receiving intel from the Illusive Man that another human colony is under attack
With the help of Mordin s studies on Collector biology Shepard successfully defends the colony but is unable to stop a large portion of the population from being captured
Shepard then recruits former squad member Tali Zorah Thane Krios and Samara before being sent to explore a supposedly disabled Collector ship
There Shepard learns that the Collectors were originally Protheans that were turned into slaves of the Reapers
With EDI s help Shepard also finds out how to bypass the Omega 4 Relay before being ambushed by the Collectors
Although Shepard s squad escape his her relationship with the Illusive Man is strained due to his prior knowledge of the trap
After optionally earning the loyalty of the squad Shepard visits a derelict Reaper and acquires an IFF necessary to safely travel through the Omega 4 Relay
Shepard may also acquire a disabled geth that if activated voluntarily joins the squad and is named Legion
The Normandy integrates the IFF into her systems while Shepard and the squad leave in a shuttle
During their absence the Collectors attack and board the Normandy
Only Joker avoids capture and with EDI s help is able to extract the Normandy to safety
After Shepard s squad returns the team uses the Omega 4 Relay to reach the Collector base located in the Galactic Center
The team rescues any surviving members of the Normandy s crew and fights their way to the central chamber
Squad members will either survive or perish depending on their loyalty to Shepard the upgrades made to the Normandy and the tasks they are assigned in battle
In the central chamber Shepard discovers that the Collectors have been constructing a new Human Reaper made from the genetic material of the abducted colonists
Shepard destroys the machine powering it and prepares to destroy the Collector base
However the Illusive Man contacts Shepard and gives the order to sterilize the base instead with a timed radiation pulse so that it can be used against the Reapers
Shepard must either follow the Illusive Man s orders or defy him before destroying the awakened Human Reaper and escaping with the surviving squad members
If no squad members survived Shepard fails to escape and dies
Back on the Normandy Shepard speaks with the Illusive Man who is either pleased or furious with Shepard s decision
As Shepard meets in the Normandy s cargo bay with the survivors Joker gives the Commander schematics of a Reaper
Humanity now has the full attention of the Reapers who awaken in dark space and descend upon the galaxy

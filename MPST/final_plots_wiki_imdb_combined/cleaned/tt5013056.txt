The film relates the story of Operation Dynamo the evacuation of surrounded British and French troops from the beaches of Dunkirk in May and June 1940 during the Second World War
It does so principally from the viewpoints of two people a newspaper reporter and a soldier
A pessimistic journalist named Charles Foreman tries unsuccessfully to rouse his complacent readers on the home front from the notion of a Phoney War before it is too late
His friend John Holden owns a small factory manufacturing buckles and is quite pleased with his profits from the Phoney War
Meanwhile the Germans rapidly take the initiative in the Battle of France threatening to destroy the Allied forces in danger of being cut off in northern France
Corporal Tubby Binns his platoon leader Lieutenant Lumpkin and a depleted section return to their camp after blowing up a bridge only to discover that their company has pulled out during the night leaving them alone in France
One man and a lorry have been left to wait for them but the driver and Lumpkin are killed by aerial strafing leaving Tubby in charge of a five man squad with no idea what the situation is or where to go
It is up to Tubby to keep his increasingly demoralised men on the move
Unsure of where to go they dodge the advancing Germans and reach a Royal Artillery battery camp
They receive some food lose Private Frazer while repelling a German column
They are ordered to head north with two other stragglers to try to link up with the rest of the British Expeditionary Force
They spend the night in a farmhouse
A German patrol arrives and Private Dave Bellman is shot badly in the chest forcing Tubby to leave him behind as it is Bellman s only chance
Eventually they get a lift in an RAF lorry and reach Dunkirk where the BEF and tens of thousands of French soldiers are gathering hoping to be evacuated
Meanwhile the overall situation is so dire that General Viscount Gort the commander of the BEF pulls out two divisions against orders so he can reinforce the wavering Belgians
The Admiralty commandeers all available civilian boats to help evacuate the troops from the beaches
Foreman insists on taking his motorboat Vanity himself despite warnings of the danger
Others follow his example
Holden does the same with some reluctance
However as time goes by his lack of commitment melts away
The soldiers on the beaches are subjected to regular aerial bombing and strafing
Tubby and his men get aboard a ship only to have it blown up and sunk before it can depart
When they get back to the beach and wait for more boats to arrive Private Barlow is hit in the face and taken to the aid station
After ferrying soldiers to the larger vessels Foreman s boat is destroyed by a bomber
He survives and is picked up by Holden in the Heron
When Heron s engine malfunctions one of Tubby s men effects repairs while Foreman and teenage crewman Frankie go ashore to survey the scene
Foreman and Tubby discuss who is responsible for the debacle
During a Sunday morning church parade Foreman is fatally wounded in an attack by German aeroplanes
However Holden Tubby and the rest of his men arrive safely back in Britain

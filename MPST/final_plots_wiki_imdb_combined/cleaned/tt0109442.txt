Meanwhile Jenna McKensie is a teacher who is getting heat from the school administration because she had witnessed gang leader Sanders pull a gun on a student
Sanders uses all sorts of tactics to harass Jenna into not testifying against him in court
However Jenna s boyfriend Emmett Grazer tends to be there to chase Sanders away much to the chagrin of Jenna who feels she doesn t need the protection 24 7
The punks wait in their car until school is over to confront John
John gets the upper hand by chaining the doors so they cannot escape and throws a grenade in the car causing it to explode
When John attends his class he finds trouble in the form of student Tiller a local troublemaker

Jenna and John soon bond and while sheriff Tom Yost is taking Jenna s report he notices John sporting a tattoo for Special Forces
When Tom asks John about a military background John walks away
Emmett is in charge of a small military museum and as a military expert he is planning a friendly paintball competition between the students
John begins to show interest in some of Emmett s military gear but is still hesitant of revealing who he really is
Meanwhile a mysterious man named G D Ash is reporting on the incidents that occurred in Kennedy High School two years ago involving android instructors malfunctioning and killing the students
John and Jenna continue their friendship with John teaching Jenna a bit about military tactics and quotes
To make sure Jenna is safe John hunts down a member of Sanders gang and at first use martial arts before chaining him to a wall and setting him on fire
However the day of the paintball competition John wages war on everyone involved and even targets John and Jenna
He kills some troublemaking students and when Jenna is once again confronted by Sanders this causes John to arrive again but this time seal the deal and kill Sanders and the rest of his gang
When Jenna confronts John John finally reveals he is a military android
When G D Ash arrives he uncovers something interesting about John
John is not an android but rather the son of Dr Bob Forrest the creator of the android teachers who have killed the students at Kennedy High two years ago
John had served in the Special Forces and has suffered from post traumatic stress disorder to the point where he actually believes that he is an android
Instead John is actually sporting a new brand of body armor making him impervious to bullets and even blades
When John and Jenna end up in Emmett s military bunker John intends to kill both himself and Jenna by planting a bomb in the bunker
However Emmett makes the save and as he and Jenna escape but John arrives and shoots Emmett
Jenna shoots John in the head causing him to fall back into the bunker
Jenna covers Emmett and declares her love for him as the bunker explodes
Two days later Jenna is preparing for school and as she is on the phone with Emmett opens her shirt to reveal she now sports the body armor John also had thanks to Emmett having a copy of the armor in his museum
Jenna copies a quote John once said about preparing for battle as she is set to begin her day

The film begins in a large garage structure where Lt Proctor and Commandant Mauser meet up with former cadets Chad Copeland and Kyle Blankes
It seems one of the two police academies is getting the axe due to the state government s unwillingness to continue financing two academies and Mauser wants Copeland and Blankes to make sure Lassard screws up
The men agree to the plan knowing this may be their only chance at revenge at Lassard for graduating them at the bottom of their class
Afterwards Mauser and Proctor find themselves and their car stuck inside the garage but when they both get out to try to forcibly open the gate arm the car falls out of park and starts rolling backwards down the ramp while Proctor tries futilely to stop it
After the governor s speech in which he will appoint a committee to evaluate which of the two academies should remain open Mauser starts getting an edge by kissing up to the governor
However Sgt
Jones quickly and discreetly humiliates Mauser with his unintelligible moaning and noises that sound like belching prompting Chief Hurst to reprimand him for his behavior
Commandant Lassard gets an idea on how to win along with now Sgt
Jones and Lt Callahan he calls back Sgt
Mahoney Sgt
Hooks Sgt
Hightower and Sgt
Tackleberry to help train the new recruits
Among the new recruits are Sgt
Fackler s wife whom Sgt
Fackler is against being trained to be a police officer Sweetchuck and Zed Karen Adams and Tackleberry s brother in law Bud Kirkland
Tomoko Nogata is at first a recruit of Mauser s academy but Mauser transfers him in with Lassard s academy instead in hopes of sabotaging the latters academy further
After a few weeks of training Nogata is lovestruck over Callahan and Sweetchuck contemplates quitting after Zed whom he was forced to room with drives him crazy
Copeland and Blankes make the recruits do things that would make the committee think they are incompetent
Mauser wants them out on the field soon knowing the committee will be there
The recruits fail and are teased by Mauser and Proctor
However Mahoney gets back at them by taping Mauser s eyes closed while doing a taste test
Proctor succeeds in removing the tape but the tape pulls off Mauser s eyebrows
Both Lassard and Mahoney give a pep talk to each of the cadets before training resumes
At the policepersons ball Mahoney meets up with his hooker friend from the first film and has her do a favor on Proctor after the latter insults Mahoney and Adams
The hooker tricks Proctor into removing all his clothes and then locking him out of the hotel room
He goes out and steals a car and drives to the academy
The car runs out of gas however and Proctor enters a building which to his horror turns out to be the Blue Oyster Bar
Meanwhile Mauser insults Lassard in front of the recruits by telling him that he is winning so Mahoney gets him back by giving a speech at the ball and then putting the microphone in a pitcher of water
When Mauser grabs it the microphone shocks him
On the final day of the cadet training evaluation competition one recruit from each academy attends the governor s ball
Copeland and Blankes play with the computer system and send cars to the wrong locations but are quickly caught by Hooks who punches them out cold
At the governor s party a gang of thieves dressed as busboys start robbing the guests and take the governor hostage
The most effective academy is proven when Mauser s cadets promptly faint upon being threatened by the thieves
Lassard s cadet Hedges manages to sound the alarm prompting Mahoney and the gang to rescue the governor
Mauser and Proctor prove to be too overconfident and ineffective to react to the emergency but Lassard s squad arrives just in time to fight off the thieves and rescue the governor
As a result of the governor s final judgment Lassard s academy stays open and the epilogue shows Lassard delivering a speech on how the academy is grateful for the many many recruits
The graduating class salutes the camera as the film ends

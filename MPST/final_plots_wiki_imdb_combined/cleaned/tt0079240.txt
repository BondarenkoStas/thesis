In 1854 Edward Pierce a charismatic member of London s high society is secretly a master thief
He plans to steal a monthly shipment of gold from the London to Folkestone train which is meant as payment for British troops fighting in the Crimean War
The gold is heavily guarded in two heavy safes in the baggage car each of which has two locks requiring a total of four keys
Pierce recruits Robert Agar a pickpocket and screwsman
Pierce s mistress Miriam and his chauffeur Barlow join the plot and a train guard Burgess is bribed into participation
The executives of the bank who arrange the gold transport the manager Mr Henry Fowler and the president Mr Edgar Trent each possess a key the other two are locked in a cabinet at the offices of the South Eastern Railway at the London Bridge train station
In order to hide the robbers intentions wax impressions are to be made of each of the keys
Pierce ingratiates himself with Trent by feigning a shared interest in ratting
He also begins courting Trent s spinster daughter Elizabeth to learn the location of her father s key
Pierce and Agar successfully break into Trent s home at night and make a wax impression of the key before making a clean getaway despite a close call with the butler
Pierce targets Fowler through his weakness for prostitutes
Miriam reluctantly poses as Madame Lucienne a high class hooker in an exclusive bordello
Miriam meets Fowler and asks him to undress forcing him to remove the key worn round his neck
While Fowler is distracted by Miriam Agar makes an impression of his key
Pierce then arranges a phony police raid to rescue Miriam forcing Fowler to flee to avoid a scandal
The keys at the train station prove a much harder challenge
After a diversionary tactic with a child pickpocket fails because Agar cannot locate the two Chubb safe keys in the key cabinet much less wax them in the time available Pierce decides to use cat burglar Clean Willy to climb the station s wall climb down into the station enter the office via a small hatch in the interior the ceiling and open the office doors from within
Because Clean Willy is incarcerated at Newgate Prison Pierce and Agar first have to break him out using a public execution as a distraction
With Willy s help the criminals succeed in taking wax impressions of the keys when the night guard takes a scheduled restroom break without detection
Clean Willy is subsequently arrested after being caught in the act pickpocketing and informs on Pierce
The police use Willy to lure Pierce into a trap but the master cracksman easily eludes capture
Clean Willy escapes from his captors but is murdered by Barlow on Pierce s orders
The authorities now aware that the robbery is imminent increase security by having the baggage car padlocked from the outside until the train arrives at its destination and forbidding passengers to travel in the guard s van
Any container large enough to hold a man must be opened and inspected before it is loaded on the train
Pierce smuggles Agar into the baggage car disguised as a corpse in a coffin
Pierce plans to reach the car across the coach roofs while the train is under way but he and Miriam encounter Fowler who is riding the train to Folkestone to watch over the shipment
After arranging for Miriam to travel in the same compartment as Fowler to divert his attention Pierce crosses the roof of the train and unlocks the baggage van s door from the outside
He and Agar replace the gold with lead bars and toss the bags of gold off the train at a prearranged point
However soot from the engine s smoke has stained Pierce s clothes and he is forced to borrow Agar s suit which is much too small for him
The jacket splits across the back when he disembarks at Folkstone
The police quickly become suspicious and arrest him before he can rejoin his accomplices
Pierce is put on trial for the robbery
As he exits the courthouse he receives the adulation of the poorer British masses who consider him a folk hero for his daring act
In the commotion a disguised Miriam kisses him full on the mouth in the process slipping him a key to his handcuffs by invisibly transferring the key from her mouth to his
Agar is also present disguised as a Police van driver
As Pierce is about to be shoved into the wagon he frees himself and he and Agar escape to the jubilation of the crowd and the chagrin of the police

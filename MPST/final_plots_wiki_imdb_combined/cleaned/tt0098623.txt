He tells her that they were married in the bar and shows her some Polaroid photos of the ceremony
Hiding out in an abandoned house in the desert the pair embarks on a torrid journey of sensual and romantic discovery who rekindles her will to live but it soon becomes clear that things can t stay this way forever

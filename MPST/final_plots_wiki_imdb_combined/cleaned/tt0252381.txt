On May 10 2010 TRAT is selected to investigate the disappearance of Edward City and its surrounding countryside
Their mission is to travel through the Time Gate locate 1300 survivors and collect data on what happened to the Third Energy project
Intelligence operative Regina is brought along as an adviser due to her past experiences
After arriving by patrol ship the team s camp is attacked by a pack of Velociraptors
Dylan Regina and David are the only survivors
The velociraptors flee when a Tyrannosaurus rex attacks the group
David damages the tyrannosaur s eye with an rocket propelled grenade
The enraged dinosaur then chases Dylan and Regina off a cliff having survived they argue about how to proceed before going their separate ways
Regina returns to the ship while Dylan heads into the jungle spotting a mysterious helmeted figure on his way to a military facility
Upon arrival he is confronted by the one eyed T rex
While escaping to the barracks he is shot at by unknown helmeted attackers
Later he attempts to retrieve a key card triggering a security alert that imprisons him
Regina receives Dylan s distress call and sets out on a rescue
Along the way Regina catches one of the mysterious attackers
She removes the helmet revealing a blonde teenage girl who is unable to speak
Regina leaves her handcuffed and goes to save Dylan
When they return to the ship they find the engine room ransacked apparently by the helmeted attackers
They are now stranded in the past
Dylan resolves to find parts to get the ship moving so they can search for information on how to reactivate the Time Gate
Before leaving he tends to the teenage girl who acts as if she recognizes Dylan
At the Research Facility Dylan discovers human containment chambers and a starter battery for the ship
Dylan returns to find the girl has escaped and discusses the possibility that the helmeted attackers could be from a different time period
Regina dismisses this saying they should focus on locating survivors and the Third Energy data
They use the repaired ship to reach the offshore Third Energy facility repelling an assault from pterosaurs and Plesiosaurus
Regina uses a diving suit at the facility to investigate the underwater reactor while evading attacks from Mosasaurus and a large Plesiosaurus
Once topside she and Dylan receive a distress call from David who has found survivors at Edward City
They use a Jeep to evade a herd of Triceratops before crashing into a field infested with velociraptors
David rescues them with a helicopter
They discover the city is under siege by raptors with no survivors left
The team splits up to find the Third Energy data
Dylan engages the T rex with a tank before being jumped by another helmeted figure
The blonde girl appears to save him
She runs away but Dylan recovers something she dropped a necklace belonging to his deceased sister
Dylan relates his past to Regina explaining that he used to be in a street gang but joined the military after a rival gang killed his mother and sister
Deciding they have no business at Edward City anymore Regina heads to a missile silo in the jungle
Regina discovers the Third Energy data at the silo but is confronted by the persistent Tyrannosaurus
Her savior is a massive Giganotosaurus that defeats the T rex in a brief fight
It follows Regina inside the missile silo causing damage that triggers a countdown to launch
Regina ignites gas vents to incinerate the Giganotosaur s head rendering it comatose
Regina stops the countdown but the beast awakens and smashes the missile to the ground
Regina escapes the resulting explosion and flees through the burning facility to reach the ship outside
Regina Dylan and David use the ship to escape further detonations from the silo
Dylan is attacked by an Allosaurus but is saved by David who pushes him into the river
Dylan is swept away by the current watching as David is devoured by the Allosaurus
Dylan awakes in an unknown area
The blonde girl returns leading him into a large base complex deep in the jungle
Inside she plays a hologram of an army colonel who explains the truth of the disaster
In the future it is discovered that the first overload in 2009 had consequently caused time alterations to the Cretaceous period that would lead to disastrous results
The space time skew would alter the Earth s history dramatically and change the human race from ever existing
To fix this an international organization enacted the Noah s Ark Plan utilizing the Timegate technology they would transport the living organisms of the Cretaceous to a different time with similar environments where they could thrive unaffected by the alterations three million years ahead
With the distortions prevented the organisms would then be returned to their original time
However there was an accident when the Noah s Ark team tried to return
The gate overloaded and was destroyed stranding both the dinosaurs and humans far in the future
The helmeted attackers are revealed to be the only remaining children of the survivors who were brought to the safety of a facility and placed in special life support chambers
These allowed for growth and learning but were intended for use by the dinosaurs
The colonel explains that because of this the children lost the ability to speak and were taught to co exist with the dinosaurs attacking anyone who threatened the animals
Finally the hologram reveals himself to be Colonel Dylan Morton speaking in 2055
Dylan realizes that he has been talking to a future version of himself and that the blonde girl is his daughter Paula
The hologram instructs Dylan there is a basic gate they can use to go home but it will work only once
He pleads for Dylan to take Paula through the gate as well
The facility suddenly announces that its self destruct sequence has been activated
Dylan is attacked by the helmeted figure that triggered the self destruct
Their fight is interrupted as the Giganotosaurus stomps inside
The helmeted figure is killed while Dylan activates an orbiting laser cannon that blasts the Giganotosaurus out of existence
Regina returns and they activate the gate but a sudden earth tremor leaves Paula trapped by falling equipment
Unable to free her and with the building ready to explode Dylan decides to stay with his daughter
He begs Regina to go back alone and find a way to save them with the Third Energy data
Regina promises to return and dashes through the gate moments before the facility explodes
The game features three post rating epilogue scenes showing the main characters in happier settings
One features Dylan driving a sports car through a city another has Regina standing in front of a window in her bedroom and a third shows Paula lying in a grassy field wearing her necklace and smiling as bubbles float by
Which image is shown changes depending on how many times the player has beaten the game

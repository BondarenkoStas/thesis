Killy a silent loner possessing an incredibly powerful weapon known as a Gravitational Beam Emitter wanders a vast technological world known as The City
He is searching for Net Terminal Genes a extinct genetic marker that allows humans to access the Netsphere a sort of computerized control network for The City
The City is an immense volume of artificial structure separated into massive floors by nearly impenetrable barriers known as Megastructure
The City is inhabited by scattered human and transhuman tribes as well as hostile cyborgs known as Silicon Creatures
The Net Terminal Genes appear to be the key to halting the unhindered chaotic expansion of the Megastructure as well as a way of stopping the murderous horde known as the Safeguard from destroying all humanity
Along the way Killy meets and joins forces with a resourceful engineer named Cibo and several groups such as a tribe of human warriors called the Electro Fishers
Cibo and Killy are often pursued by the Safeguard who view any human without Net Terminal Genes as a threat to be extinguished on sight
Because of the size and nature of The City and the violent lives led by its inhabitants there are virtually no recurring characters and any alliances made are short lived
Setting The City is actually a structure that began on Earth
The mechanical beings known as Builders which move around reforming and creating new landscapes appear to have begun building without end creating an enormous structure with little internal logic or coherence
The City appears to be organized into distinct floors with layers of an unknown material called the megastructure between them
Traveling between floors is extremely difficult as the megastructure is almost indestructible and approaching the floor boundaries results in a massive safeguard response
Only a direct Gravitational Beam Emitter blast is known to have been capable of penetrating the megastructure
The City and the Builders were once controlled by the Netsphere and the Authority but they have since lost the power to control the expansion of The City due to the chaotic and insecure manner of its growth
Without intervention by a user with Net Terminal Genes they cannot reestablish control over The City nor the Safeguards whose original job was to eliminate any humans who try to access the Netsphere without Net Terminal Genes
The Safeguard now attempts to destroy all humans without the Net Terminal Gene as the degradation of The City has corrupted their true goals
In regards to the scale of the structure NOiSE the prequel to Blame states in its final chapter that At one point even the Moon which used to be up in the sky above was integrated into The City s structure
It has been suggested by Tsutomu Nihei himself in his artbook Blame
and So On that the scale of The City is beyond that of a Dyson sphere reaching at least Jupiter s planetary orbit this is also suggested in scenarios such as Blame

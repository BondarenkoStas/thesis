As the opening credits roll the audience hears The Clouds Will Soon Roll By a typical Great Depression era type lyric while the audience watches a rain storm
The time and place is set as 1934 Chicago
As the action begins an alarm clock wakes Arthur Parker who rolls over to wake his wife Joan by trying to interest in some early morning sex but his shy practically frigid wife turns him down
Arthur is frustrated by his wife s disinterest in sex
While he dresses for work he lip syncs I ll Never Have to Dream Again to a female voice
The song continues during breakfast with Arthur singing for himself
In addition to Arthur s sexual disappointments he is further frustrated because his wife will not finance the start of his own business
Arthur leaves home that morning and threatens never to return
He goes to a bank to borrow enough money to start a sheet music store
With no collateral the banker refuses to loan him any money
During moments when his dreams are shattered Arthur shuts out reality by escaping into Busby Berkeley like musical production numbers
In this particular instance Arthur and the banker lip synch the lyrics to Yes Yes
performed by Sam Browne and the Carlyle Cousins
They are joined by several chorus girls who tap dance and toss large cardboard coins
During the song Arthur is showered with bags of coins and the song develops into a huge production number complete with over heard camera shots of dancers in kaleidoscopic patterns and the dancers reflected in a highly polished mirror like floor
During one sequence the banker and Arthur are dressed in cut away suits and dance with a chorus line of girls
The scene changes to Arthur driving down the road where he picks up a hitch hiker the Accordion Man
Later while Arthur sells some sheet music to the owner of Barrett s Music Shop Eileen enters
Even though she is a shy rather plain school teacher Arthur expresses his instant attraction to her by singing Did You Ever See a Dream Walking
During the number Eileen is converted into a lovelier version of herself and performs a tap dance routine
She leaves the store without paying much attention to Arthur
As she walks down the street Eileen hears the Accordion Man singing Rock of Ages and gives him a contribution which prompts him to launch into a spirited rendition of The Old Rugged Cross
Soon the hitch hiker devours some food at Jimmy s Diner an Italian American food joint
He and Arthur are sitting together in a booth but Arthur isn t eating
As he gives his meal to the enigmatic bum the diner walls disappear and Arthur walks out into the rain and dances to a violin solo of Pennies from Heaven
The rain drops become coins raining down as he dances in front of a huge backdrop collage depicting various scenes from the Great Depression
After the song Arthur gives the Accordion Man a quarter leaves the diner and heads for Eileen s farm
He had learned she was a school teacher so he asked some children where she lived
Although Eileen is frightened at first she listens as he expresses his infatuation with her
The scene changes to a bar where a couple of other salesmen are lamenting the depression economics but Arthur smiling claims he s doing great
He and the other salesmen perform a vaudeville act type rendition of It s the Girl which includes a tap dance routine and Arthur performing a short banjo solo
The following scene shows Eileen reading the Brothers Grimm fairy tale Rapunzel to her school class
Suddenly the children are dressed in all white and their desks become small white grand pianos on which they accompany their teacher as she sings Love Is Good For Anything That Ails You
The children also tap dance on top of their pianos
Back to reality the school s principal scolds them for making so much noise
Arthur is waiting outside when school is dismissed to drive Eileen home
During their visit Arthur makes the mistake of saying My wife but he quickly tries to cover up by claiming his wife was killed in a motorcycle accident
Then he plays on Eileen s sympathy by asking her to take the pain away
When he returns home to his wife Joan gives into one of Arthur s sexual fetishes by putting lipstick on her nipples
Once he entices her to reveal them to him she cries and asks Are they as nice as hers
He lies to her and claims that even though he has been tempted when he is out on the road he has refrained
We hear the radio play Let s Put Out the Lights while Arthur talks about wanting to play the sax and have his own dance band
The next morning Arthur is happy he s had sex with his wife and she has finally agreed to finance his record shop
While he dresses Joan sings It s a Sin to Tell a Lie
During the song she picks up a pair of scissors to stab him in the back but it is only an illusion she is actually still in bed
It is what she would like to do if she had the nerve
After some time passes Eileen is fired from her teaching position because she is pregnant
Meanwhile Arthur has opened his record store but is languishing with few customers
One evening he drives to a bridge where he sees a girl walking towards him
He speaks to her and determines that she is blind
He offers to walk with her and compliments her beauty
Later he goes to Eileen who informs him she is going to have his baby
She forces him to write down his address so that she ll know where to find him
He promises to do what he can to help
One of the things that attracts him most about Eileen is that she isn t shocked by his sexual suggestions rather she seems to relish them
In this instance he tells her about a man giving an elevator operator 20 to turn his back so he and his date can have sex
When she likes the idea Arthur is thrilled
She sings I Want to Be Bad as they act out their sexual fantasy in an elevator
In the following scene the blind girl Arthur had met earlier stumbles over the bum Arthur had picked up earlier in the film
Although the film audience doesn t see the act the bum rapes and kills the girl
Later as Arthur returns from his tryst with Eileen he happens upon the crime scene and sees the blind girl dead
We see a Camel cigarette package that will later be used as evidence against Arthur
During this sequence we hear a reprise of The Clouds Will Soon Roll By playing in the background
As Arthur leaves the crime scene he almost runs over the vagrant who committed the crime
I could be wrong but the way I remember it Arthur does hit the vagrant killing him and throwing his body into some bushes where presumably it is never found isaiah53 5 Back home Arthur is so shaken by what he has seen that he promises Joan that he will change and will be good in the future
Eileen wanders into a bar where she orders lemonade but Tom a stylish pimp talks her into adding gin to her lemonade
She offers herself to him for 5 and tells him her name is Lulu
Tom and three of his cronies perform a song and dance routine to Let s Misbehave
During the number a couple of elderly whores join Tom and he and Lulu tap dance on top of the bar
Soon Arthur realizes his life with Joan is over
The film audience sees Arthur Joan and Eileen dressed in sailor outfits sing Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries into a radio microphone
One evening as Arthur is leaving his record store he hears Eileen laughing goes over to her and offers to buy her a cup of coffee
During their conversation she reveals that she aborted the baby
When he takes her to his record shop she further reveals that she has become a prostitute and enjoys it
Arthur admits that he should have held on to her but he was too obsessed with owning a record store
Once they both realize they are still in love with each other they decide to run away together
Before they go they smash all the records in the store except for Pennies from Heaven
Arthur won t allow her to break that one
The police question Joan and tell her that Arthur closed the store and was seen at a bar with a prostitute
When they tell her that her husband is a suspect in a murder case she reveals that he traveled to Chicago and back at the time of the murder
One evening Eileen and Arthur go to movies to see Follow the Fleet
Soon Arthur mimes Astaire and he and Eileen walk up on the stage in front of the screen and dance like Fred and Ginger
Suddenly Arthur and Eileen are transformed into a black and white film sequence in which they dance with a chorus of male dancers
At the end of the dance the males canes become the bars of a jail cell
When they leave the movie theater Eileen and Arthur see a newspaper headline about the blind girl being murdered
As Arthur feverishly drives away he tries to get Eileen to believe he is innocent of the crime
Abruptly Eileen tells Arthur goodbye
He asks if she is running out on him to which she replies Not fun is it
The next morning while Arthur is trying to get his car started the cops arrive
He runs but they catch him
Even though he pleads his innocence he is convicted
At the gallows he quotes the verse of Pennies from Heaven and then sings the chorus
As Eileen looks out a window Arthur still dressed in his prison clothes comes running back calling her name
She can t understand why he is there he has just witnessed his execution
He says Whoever said you could stop a dream
We couldn t go through all that without a happy ending
That line leads into the finale which is a huge Busby Berkeley type production number to The Glory of Love
The number opens with a stage full of chorus girls who are seated and kicking their legs
Soon Eileen and Arthur dressed in new costumes enter and sing
Towards the end of the number a rainbow appears in the sky and the camera pans up through the clouds to a fair sky and a full moon
During the end credits renditions of Pennies from Heaven and Love Is Good For Anything That Ails You are heard

On a dark and stormy night an elderly pharmacist falls asleep at his stool while mixing poisonous chemicals in a glass bottle
After he falls asleep the night takes a sudden fantastical turn as his poisonous bottle topped with a skull and crossbones stopper as a warning label suddenly springs to life becoming a malevolent cackling skeleton
Laughing evilly and screaming Death walks tonight
the skeleton douses the pharmacist with chemicals that mysteriously cause him to shrink
Waking up the pharmacist sets out to explore his store in his new minuscule form and finds that all of the bottles in the pharmacy have similarly sprung to life with most of them taking on colorful personalities based on their contents three baby bottles become a trio of crying babies a bottle of Scotch whiskey becomes a jolly Scotsman a bottle of Absorbine and Absorbine Jr become a father and son a container of vanishing cream playfully vanishes and reappears a bottle of smelling salts sniffs everyone in close proximity and a bottle of India ink takes the form of an Indian snake charmer charming a tube of Cobra Toothpaste that becomes a live snake
With the evil skeleton nowhere in sight the pharmacist joins the bottles in their merriment as they all begin to sing dance and frolic in turn three bottles of Cuban rum sing a Spanish song a pair of rubber gloves spring to life and tap dance a bottle of Carmencita brand powder and a bottle of toilet water dance a flamenco dance a pair of salt shakers come to life as Dutch children and go ice skating on a mirror while a bottle of talcum powder drops imaginary snow on them a bottle of shaving cream happily takes up a shaving razor and the pharmacist finally takes up a smoking pipe and begins playing it like a tuba
But all is not well in the pharmacy as the skeleton has secretly formed an alliance with a small cadre of evil bottles that inhabit the darker corners of the shelves a bottle of witch hazel springs to life as an old witch and several bottles of spirits of ammonia open up to release a trio of mischievous singing ghosts
As the witch and the skeleton mix a poisonous brew in the pharmacist s beakers and test tubes the ghosts fly out to snatch up the pharmacist and bring him back to the skeleton
As the skeleton cackles triumphantly the ghosts hurl the pharmacist into the glass distiller as it bubbles with chemicals
Helpless the pharmacist is sent hurtling through the twisting tubes of his distiller chased and ground up in a mincer only to be hurled back into the distiller after the skeleton sucks him up in a syringe
After sending him through the distiller twice the skeleton finally traps the pharmacist in a glass beaker laughing as he ties him up with rubber tubing and attacks him with a pair of scissors threatening to snip him in half
Finally when the pharmacist s death seems certain he wakes up at his stool unharmed and back to his normal size
Looking to his bottle of poisonous chemicals the pharmacist realizes that he had merely been having a nightmare and laughs in relief

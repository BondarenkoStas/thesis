The novel opens in London in AF 632
The society is illuminated by the activities of the novel s central characters Lenina Crowne and Bernard Marx and others
Lenina a hatchery worker is socially accepted and contented but Bernard a psychologist in the Directorate of Hatcheries and Conditioning is not
He is shorter in stature than the average of his Alpha caste a quality shared by the lower castes which gives him an inferiority complex
His intelligence and his work with hypnopaedia allow him to understand and disapprove of the methods by which society is sustained
Courting disaster he is vocal and arrogant about his differences
Bernard is mocked by other Alphas because of his stature as well as for his individualistic tendencies and is threatened with exile to Iceland because of his nonconformity
His only friend is Helmholtz Watson a lecturer at the College of Emotional Engineering
The friendship is based on their feelings of being misfits but unlike Bernard Watson s sense of alienation stems from being exceptionally gifted intelligent handsome and physically strong
Helmholtz is drawn to Bernard as a confidant
Bernard takes a holiday with Lenina at a Savage Reservation in New Mexico
There they observe ceremonies including a ritual in which a village boy is whipped into unconsciousness
They encounter Linda a woman originally from the World State who is living on the reservation with her son John now a young man
She too visited the reservation on a holiday and became separated from her group and was left behind
She had meanwhile become pregnant by a fellow holidaymaker
She did not try to return to civilization because of her shame at her pregnancy
Neither Linda nor John are accepted by the villagers and their life has been hard and unpleasant
Linda has taught John to read although from only two books a scientific manual from his mother s job in the hatchery and the collected works of Shakespeare
Ostracised by the villagers John is able to articulate his feelings only in terms of Shakespearean drama especially the tragedies of Othello Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet
Linda now wants to return to London while John wants to see the brave new world his mother has told him about
Bernard sees an opportunity to thwart plans to exile him and gets permission to take Linda and John back
On his return to London Bernard is confronted by the Director but turns the tables by presenting him with his long lost lover and unknown son
John calls the Director his father a vulgarity which causes a roar of laughter
The humiliated Director resigns in shame
Bernard as custodian of the savage John who is now treated as a celebrity is fawned on by the highest members of society and revels in attention he once scorned
However his triumph is short lived
Decrepit and friendless Linda goes on a permanent soma that is drugged holiday while John refuses to attend social events organised by Bernard appalled by what he perceives to be an empty society
Society drops Bernard as swiftly as it had taken him
Lenina and John are physically attracted to each other but John s view of courtship and romance based on Shakespeare is utterly incompatible with Lenina s freewheeling attitude to sex
Lenina tries to seduce John but he attacks her for being an impudent strumpet
John is then informed that his mother is extremely ill
He rushes to her bedside causing a scandal as this is not the correct attitude to death
Some Delta children who enter the ward for death conditioning irritate John to the point where he attacks one physically
He then tries to break up a distribution of soma to a lower caste group and is set upon by the outraged recipients
Helmholtz who has been called by Bernard also becomes involved in the fracas
Bernard Helmholtz and John are brought before Mustapha Mond the Resident World Controller for Western Europe
Bernard and Helmholtz are told they are to be exiled to islands seen by society at large as a punishment for antisocial activity
Bernard pleads grovelling for a second chance but Helmholtz welcomes the opportunity to be an individual and chooses the Falkland Islands as his destination believing that their bad weather will inspire his writing
Mond says that Bernard does not know that exile is actually a reward
The islands are full of the most interesting people in the world individuals who did not fit in the World State community
Mond outlines for John the events that led to the present society and his arguments for a caste system and social control
John rejects Mond s arguments and Mond sums up by saying that John demands the right to be unhappy
John asks if he may go to the islands as well but Mond refuses saying he wishes to continue the experiment
John moves to an abandoned hilltop air lighthouse there near the village of Puttenham where he intends to adopt an ascetic lifestyle in order to purify himself of civilization and make amends for his mistreatment of his mother
He practises self mortification and his self flagellation is witnessed by bystanders turning him into a sensational spectacle
Hundreds of sightseers hoping to witness his behaviour arrive at John s lighthouse one of them is Lenina
At the sight of the woman he both adores and loathes John attacks her with his whip
The onlookers are whipped into a frenzy by the display and John is caught up in a soma fueled orgy
The next morning John remembers the previous night s events and is stricken with remorse
Onlookers and journalists who arrive that evening find that he has hanged himself his body twisting aimlessly in the lighthouse

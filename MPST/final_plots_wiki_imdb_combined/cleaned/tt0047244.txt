Opening monologue of the stories people of the Pacific tell about what lays below the ocean we are then told the above water shots were filmed on this shore line and the underwater shots in the nearby ocean deep On a beach Julie Blair talks to a young boy as she draws the ocean
He talks about the death of his father killed by a creature that lives underwater in the cove
Later she goes for a swim in same area as she does so she encounters a small one man sub surfacing
Annoyed she swims back to shore followed by the sub The operator Steve Dunning follows her up the beach and admires her artwork
He explains that he is down in the area on a research grant
He invites her out to the teams boat to meet Doctor Baldwin Baldwin shows her some plankton through a microscope and explains what they are and how dangerous they are and we are lucky they are so small
Dunning then goes into an explanation of how the sea is going to become and increasing important food sourceA boat driven by Joe arrives and explains there has been an accident and his brother is trapped on the bottom in the cove
Dunning takes the one man sub down on a rescue mission
Dunning finds the mans diving suit but there is no one inside it
The face plate looks damaged as if torn open by something Later that day at dinner Julie tells Dunning the strange story the boy told her about a creature in the cove
She then explains that shed spoken to others and they confirmed the boys story
As the conversation continues Dunning admits he is attracted to Julie she admits similar feelings
He is concerned that she is going to try and find the creature herself
He warns her of the dangerAfter dinner Dunning finally agrees to try and investigate what happening at the cove
He explains the various dangerous fish they may encounter and what to do if they do
Having briefed her they head underwater
As Anne swims around she catches sight of a huge octopus and hides among the kelp till it goes away
Safe she heads for the surface and convinces Dunning to abandon the search for the dayLater Anne speaks to Joe about the loss of his brother Joe explains that many people have died down there and it is like nothing we have ever seen
The first occurrence in the cove was around 1946
Joe suggests talking to Pablo Who has lived in the area all his lifeAnne speaks to him about the devil that lives in the cove she explains the ocean holds many forms of life some of it makes no sense
But nature does many strange things
He tells her about three strange encounters in the cove
A large shapeless thing maybe as big as a houseLater Anne encounters Tula who tells a similar story about seeing huge tracks in the sands and something as big as three wagons moving in the darkness
That night Dunning and Anne are relaxing on the beach Anne remembers one of the stories that the creature in the cove comes out during a full moon
She also describes the creature is huge with a single red eye Dunning ponders her information about the first sighting in 1946 and how it ties in with the first atomic tests in the area
They are interrupted by Baldwin arriving to give Dunning the good news about an extension of their funding
The funding means the team will be heading down the coast
Dunning wants Julie to write and gives her a kiss before heading to the hotel to packIn the darkness Julie sees something rising up out of the water
It is like a giant octopus with one eye
She passes out before it comes ashore
Further up the beach Pablo and Tula discuss the meaning of the full moon
Tula suggests a sacrifice must be made to the creature Tula decides Julie is the best choice
She instructs Pablo to make it happenJulie wakes up and decides to explore the beach
She finds some strange tracks and the remains of what she thinks is a cow
Returning the next morning Julie gets Pablo to point out where hes seen a glowing light Unseen by Julie he cuts his hand and sprinkles the blood in the water Attracted by the blood a shark stalks Julie
She fights the fish off with a knife
Safe she swims on to investigate the coveThe next day down the coast Dunning and Baldwin discuss Julies infatuation with the monster
Dunning is dismissive however Baldwin tells a story of seeing evidence of a strange winged creature many years before
Dunning disbelieves him but accepts something strange must have happenedBack at the cove Julie surviving the encounter with the shark plans to to go again and asks Pablo to row her out
As she is distracted he sabotages her aqua gear so she will run out of air during the dive
Julie realizes something is wrong aborts the dive before she can drownGiving up for the day she tries to pull up the anchor but it is being held by something suddenly the line snaps releasing the boat
Back with Dunning and Baldwin the post worker arrives and delivers a letter and a package
In the package is a sample of some flesh recovered when Julie went down to rescue the anchor The men examine the sample and find it extremely unusual
Baldwin drops some meat into the sample and they are stunned when the organism absorbs the meatBaldwin speculates that many things could cause this strange life form possibly a nearby atomic test
Dunning realizes the danger presented and races back to the cove to check on Julie
They drive their boat at full speed through the night as they get close to the cover they see Julie with Pablo getting ready for a dive
Pablo pulls a knife and intends to kill Julie at the last minute he cracks under the pressure and puts the knife away
He then admits draining the air from the tank Julie once again dives looking for more evidence of the creature lurking below the water
On the surface Pablo keeps a concern eye
Now almost at the cove the boat breaks down when the propeller is fowled by sea weed Dunning clears the weed and the boat resumes its urgent journey
Meanwhile still on her dive Julie encounters the strange creature and tries to escape
On the surface Dunning and Baldwin fnally arrive
Pablo senses something is wrong and tells Dunning who immediately deploys the sub Dunning spots the creature and drives the sub headlong into its eye killing it instantly He then abandons the vessel and drags unconscious Julie to the boat
He checks her out and she regains her senses

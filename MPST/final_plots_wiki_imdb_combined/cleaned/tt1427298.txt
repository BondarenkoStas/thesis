The Human Race is a film that surprised even us
It s an absolute triumph of ingenuity in low budget filmmaking a smartly scripted powerhouse that consistently plays against expectations to deliver an endearingly individualistic take on the genre
It takes a number of astonishing risks and it constantly introduces elements that would be used as manipulative devices in weaker films and then obliterates them without mercy

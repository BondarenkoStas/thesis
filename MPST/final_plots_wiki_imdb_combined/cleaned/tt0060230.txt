After Charlie Brown s team loses their first game of the season his team throw down their caps in disgust and quit
Frustrated and depressed Charlie Brown wanders around aimlessly until Linus meets him with good news Mr Hennessey operator of a local hardware store is offering to sponsor Charlie Brown s team place them in an organized league and even buy them new uniforms
While Linus is inflating a pool Charlie Brown s sister Sally appears in her bikini bathing suit
The excitement gets the better of Charlie Brown and he eagerly tells the team the good news
Lucy is apprehensive but states that if Charlie Brown can really get the team uniforms they will give him another chance and return to the team
Later at home Charlie Brown gets a phone call from Mr Hennessey and is told that the league does not allow girls or dogs
Charlie Brown tries to reason with Mr Hennessey but Mr Hennessey replies that they are the league s rules not his
Unwilling to sacrifice his friends Charlie Brown has no choice but to turn down Mr Hennessey s offer
Moments later Charlie Brown relays the news to Linus who tells him that Lucy and the team will most likely be angry with his decision
However Charlie hits on an idea he will not tell them until after the next game figuring their lifted spirits will drive them to a great win
Linus says this may not be a good idea but Charlie Brown feels it will work
The game starts off slowly but as it picks up the team begins to play spectacularly
Inspired by Snoopy successfully stealing second third and home Charlie Brown attempts the same thing in the bottom of the ninth inning successfully stealing second and third
However he tries to win the game by stealing home only to be thrown out at the plate ending the game
Lucy and several others tell Charlie Brown that if it were not for the uniforms and the league deal they would quit
Charlie Brown then tells the team that he told Mr Hennessey that the deal was off
This causes the team to yell in anger and storm off
As the girls complain about their misfortune and Snoopy is shown sharing their disgust Linus speaks up telling them the real reason why Charlie Brown turned the offer down
Both Linus and Schroeder berate the girls and Snoopy for their selfishness pointing out that Charlie Brown was not willing to sacrifice them just to get the uniforms
This causes the girls and Snoopy to feel terrible for being so hard on Charlie Brown
They are uncertain what to do until Lucy comes up with an idea to make up for the insults make a special uniform for Charlie Brown
After Linus insists there is no material available Lucy grins evilly and says they do and it is Linus s security blanket
Then they make a uniform for Charlie Brown with the only material available Linus s security blanket
The girls and Snoopy present the newly made uniform to Charlie Brown who is very pleased with it
He is determined that his team will win the next day but the next day it rains so there is no ball game
Charlie Brown just stands in the rain on the pitcher s mound where Linus finds him and tells him that nobody will come to the field
He then looks nervously at Charlie Brown and when Charlie Brown questions him for it he then wails to him that his uniform was made from his blanket
So Charlie Brown lets Linus hold the shirt tail against his cheek and suck his thumb while the two of them stand together in the pouring rain during the closing credits

Oh his first day as Marshal of Larado Red Ryder and his Indian ward Little Beaver are summoned to duty when the town s bank courier Barton is robbed
However Barton is able to fire his weapon and the fleeing robber whom he recognizes as Ferguson who tosses the money he s stolen into a water trough where it is latter collected by his crime partner Pretty Boy Murphy
Red captures Ferguson however Murphy delivers the stolen cash to the head of the gang saloon owner Denver Jack
Denver Jack plans to use a photograph that he took of Ferguson robbing the bank in order to maintain control over Ferguson less he talk and confess all to the Marshal of Laredo
Jack has maintained similar evidence on all of his men and considers Ferguson as no different
Denver Jack s continuing threat of matches around Pretty Boy Murphy horribly scarred from a fire continually terrorizes the henchman demonstrating the cold cruelty of the gang boss
Denver contacts his lawyer Larry Randall who tells him that if the courier fails to identify Ferguson the gunman must be released
Denver Jack sends Pretty Boy to work Barton over and thus frighten the courier into keeping quiet
Barton refuses to identify the gangster and Red is compelled to release Ferguson
Randall is dismayed by Denver s methods and Larry s fianc√©e Judy Bowers becomes furious that he is working for such a bad person as Denver Jack
Judy s father the banker Mel Bowers is angry as well and orders Larry to never see his daughter again
Randall wants to win Judy back and so breaks his ties with Denver Jack and recovers the stolen money which is returned to the banks
Larry expresses his regrets for working with Jack and says that it is over
Bowers agrees to allow Larry to continue to see his daughter provided that he continues to honor his words and remain straight for six months
However as they are talking Bowers is gunned downed by Pretty Boy and Larry is arrested for murder
Laredo s Dr Allen tells Red Ryder that he was present at the beginning of Randal and Bowers conversation and that he saw Larry kill the father
Larry is puzzled by Dr Allen s statement because the doctor had left before the shooting
Suddenly he comes to the realization that Denver Jack must also be blackmailing Allen
Denver Jack approaches Larry Randal at a later time and promises that he will get Randal released from jail if he promises to continue to work for him
Randal refuses and so later it is Dr Allen s testimony that results in a conviction
In the meantime Red Ryder has become increasingly more suspicious of Denver Jack and arranges for Larry to break out of jail
He follows Randall to Allen s office where Larry confronts the doctor who confesses that he is being blackmailed by Denver Jack
Overhearing the admission Red bursts into the room and orders Allen to write a confession
Unfortunately before the doctor can finish the letter he is shot dead by Pretty Boy who fires through a window
Denver Jack complains loudly to the locals that Red Ryder is in league with Larry Randall and works to stir up the gathering crowd against the Marshal
As the rowdy crowd closes in Red Larry and Little Beaver manage to get away
Later that evening Red returns to Denver Jack s office and discovers Jack s blackmail material
Denver Jack and Pretty Boy Murphy capture Red and trap Little Beaver when Larry tries to escape
To protect the Indian boy Larry allows himself to be returned to jail now guarded over by Pretty Boy
Read starts a fire and escapes but not before forcing Pretty Boy to confess to the killings of Bowers and Allen
Red manages to stop Larry s hanging just it time and stops Denver Jack
With Larry s name cleared and the criminals arrested Red Little Beaver and Red s aunt The Duchess watch cheerfully as Larry Randall is once again back together again with Judy Barton

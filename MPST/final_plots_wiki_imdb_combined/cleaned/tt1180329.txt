Antoine forms a strong friendship with Colette and eventually also her parents who begin to treat him as if he were a part of their family
Colette s feelings for Antoine are at first ambiguous and harbouring some hope that she might grow to return them he leaves his apartment at the Place Clichy and moves into an apartment across the road from her family s
Although she continues to treat him kindly it slowly becomes apparent that she is not interested in him romantically
He sulks about this and at first refuses to see her but he is lured back by a dinner invitation
It is clear that her family still consider him a surrogate son and are possibly hoping for something romantic to happen between the two teenagers
All of these hopes are dashed however when the pretty Colette is met at the front door by an older man
Her parents and Antoine look helplessly on as she disappears off with her date
They are all left to watch television

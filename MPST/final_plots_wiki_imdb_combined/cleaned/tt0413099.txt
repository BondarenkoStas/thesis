Newly elected to Congress former local television news reporter Evan Baxter leaves his hometown of Buffalo New York and moves to the fictional community of Prestige Crest in Virginia where his congressional campaign officially declares that he will change the world
Evan prays to God to give him this opportunity
His wife Joan also prays that she Evan and their three sons will be closer together as a family
On the first day of his job at Congress Evan is given a prime office space where he is accompanied by his three congressional staffers and invited to junior co sponsor the Public Land Act bill with his greedy boss Chuck Long
Soon after Evan s election to Congress six strange things start to happen around him The number 614 starts to appear everywhere he goes Ancient tools and gopher wood are delivered to his house that he actually did not order
A man revealed to be the God appears everywhere he goes
Pairs of animals simply follow Evan without any apparent reason
Evan grows a beard that instantly reappears no matter how many times he shaves every morning
Eight vacant lots in Prestige Crest are purchased in his name
Evan soon learns that 614 refers to the verse in the Book of Genesis where God originally instructs Noah to build an Ark in preparation for a flood
God later repeatedly appears in various guises before finally revealing himself to Evan and cordially insisting that he should also build an Ark as well
God explains to Evan that a flood is coming and that the only opportunity Evan will have to change the world is by saving his community instead
God also tells Evan to inform others about the flood should they ask him later
Concerned about Evan s behaviour Joan initially believes that he is having a mid life crisis
Evan begins constructing the Ark with his sons who start to admire him as he is spending more time with them
Animals eventually follow Evan to Congress
When Long discovers this he allows Evan latitude at first but warns him that he will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future
Meanwhile Evan s staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior
When Evan returns to the Ark during construction God presents him with a robe and later tells him that the flood will likely come at midday on September 22
When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior Evan tells her the truth God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new looks and recent actions although Joan does not believe Evan and she is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind
After wearing the robe for some time Evan finds it comfortable but soon realizes that God will not allow him to take it off and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later
The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe midway during the session
Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission but Long does not take him seriously and Evan is suspended from Congress and removed from the Public Land Act bill
Evan deduces that God purposely had him suspended from Congress so that he would have more time to build the Ark
In continued skepticism Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he is going insane
Evan decides to build the Ark alone gaining media attention and public ridicule as hundreds of animals assemble in pairs
Meanwhile God appears to Joan as a waiter at a diner
God listens to Joan as she expresses concern that Evan is only losing his sanity and allowing himself to become a laughing stock though claiming that God told him to do it
Sympathetic toward Evan God tells Joan that perhaps it is an only opportunity for them and explains that he does not give things but only the opportunity by which to obtain things citing togetherness of families as one of these things
Seeing God s meaning Joan finally returns to Evan with new found faith and continue helping him finish the Ark together in order to prepare for the flood
Meanwhile Evan overhears his staffers that Long has commissioned a dam and has cut corners in doing so and that he will most likely do the same thing with his Public Land Act bill
On September 22 Evan loads hundreds of animals onto the Ark in front of hundreds of spectators and live news crews who continue to mock him
Later Long and the policemen arrive with a wrecking ball crew to try and destroy the Ark since it violates numerous building codes in Prestige Crest
Minutes pass with no sign of rain and while a heavy rainstorm does come it passes within moments leaving Evan himself humiliated
However Evan connects Long s profiteering ethics and what God had already told him and realizes that the dam under Long Lake is preparing to burst
Evan warns to those present must board the Ark and many have do so when the prophesied flood is triggered shortly after the dam burst
Prestige Crest is catastrophically destroyed and the Ark later rides the flood through the streets and landmarks of Washington D C
The Ark reaches its final destination in front of the Capitol which disrupts the vote on the Public Land Act bill
Long becomes outraged that the flood did really happen
Evan informs Long that the flood was actually caused by his poor design of the dam which prompts the other Congressmen also present to turn against Long
After Congress suspends the Public Land Act bill to investigate Long s profiteering ethics and the animals return to their natural habitats Evan is finally reinstated as a congressman and celebrates this event by shaving his beard changing back into his regular clothes and going on a long promised hiking trip
When God reappears once again during the hike Evan is initially disappointed as he realizes he should never have needed to build the Ark since the flood had only happened due to Long s defective dam
However God reassures Evan that he now has a perfect life as well as everything that he had originally prayed for and that this would not have happened otherwise
Evan is happy to realize this and God informs him that the right way to change the world is by doing one Act of Random Kindness at a time
During the film s closing credits God issues a new commandment to the outgoing audience Thou shalt do the dance
This is later followed by a footage depicting the film s cast and crew members dancing to C C Music Factory s hit song Gonna Make You Sweat

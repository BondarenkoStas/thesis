In 1982 New York a boy named Charlie Carbone is about to become the stepson of a mobster named Salvatore Maggio
On that same day he meets his new best friend Louis Booker who saves him from drowning after the mobster s apprentice Frankie Lombardo who was recently released from juvenile hall tried to drown Charlie
Twenty years later in 2002 Charlie is a boy next door who has his own beauty salon and Louis is still his best friend but Sal s henchmen take a majority of the profit leaving Charlie very little for improvements
After they botch the job of hiding some stolen goods resulting in some of Sal s men getting arrested Sal gives Charlie and Louis one more chance
Under instructions from Frankie they have to deliver a package to Australia to a man named Mr Smith
Frankie also tells them that should they run into trouble they should call Mr Smith at the phone number he gives them
Unknown to Charlie and Louis Sal tells his Capo that he is cancelling their return trip
Once on the plane Louis opens the package to find 50 000 in cash
Upon landing they rent a car
On their way to Mr Smith they accidentally run over a kangaroo
Thinking it s dead Louis puts his lucky jacket on the kangaroo and with Charlie s sunglasses for a joke as they think the kangaroo looks like Jackie Legs one of Sal s henchmen
The kangaroo then regains consciousness and hops away with one problem the 50 000 was in the jacket
Charlie and Louis get into the rented LandCruiser and try to grab the money from the jacket on the kangaroo but the ensuing chase ends with the duo running into a field of termite mounds and crashing into a pile of rocks
At a nearby pub Louis manages to call Mr Smith and tell him about their situation
Mr Smith tells Louis that they had better have his money when he meets them
He plans to find them himself
Back in New York City Salvatore gets a call from Mr Smith saying that Charlie and Louis haven t arrived yet
Salvatore sends Frankie and some men to Australia to investigate
Meanwhile one of the attempts to reclaim the money strands Charlie and Louis in the desert
They meet and get help from a woman named Jessie
They then track the kangaroo at a nearby valley
Mr Smith and his henchmen arrive soon after and capture the trio
Charlie and Louis outsmart them only to find Frankie has tracked them and is prepared to kill them
After getting the money back from the kangaroo they learn from Frankie that Sal really sent them to Australia to pay for their own execution
Out of nowhere police arrive and arrest Frankie Mr Smith and their henchmen and Charlie reclaims Louis s lucky jacket from the kangaroo
One year later in 2003 Charlie and Jessie are married and sell their new shampoo having used the payoff money to start up a line of hair care products
Frankie and his men have been imprisoned for life which Sal has failed at avoiding
Louis is Charlie s advertising partner
As for the kangaroo he is still happily hopping around the outback

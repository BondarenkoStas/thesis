The film opens with this quote The Fault is Not in Our Stars But in Ourselves and announces that it wishes to highlight the virtues of psychoanalysis in banishing mental illness and restoring reason
Dr Constance Petersen is a psychoanalyst at Green Manors a mental hospital in Vermont
She is perceived by the other doctors as detached and emotionless
The director of the hospital Dr Murchison is being forced into retirement shortly after returning from an absence due to nervous exhaustion
His replacement is Dr Anthony Edwardes who turns out to be surprisingly young
Dr Petersen notices that Dr Edwardes has a peculiar phobia about sets of parallel lines against a white background
She also soon realizes by comparing handwriting that this man is an impostor
He confides to her that he killed Dr Edwardes and took his place
He suffers from massive amnesia and does not know who he is
Dr Petersen believes he is innocent and suffering from a guilt complex
He disappears overnight leaving a note for her
At the same time it becomes public knowledge that Dr
Edwardes is an impostor and that the real Dr Edwardes is missing and may have been murdered
Dr Petersen manages to track him down and starts to use her psychoanalytic training to break his amnesia and find out what really happened
Pursued by the police Dr Petersen and the impostor travel by train to Rochester New York where they stay with Dr Brulov Dr Petersen s former mentor
The two doctors analyze a dream that John Brown had
The dream sequence is full of psychoanalytic symbols eyes curtains scissors playing cards a man with no face a man falling off a building a man hiding behind a chimney and dropping a wheel and being pursued by large wings
They deduce that Brown and Edwardes had been on a ski trip together and that Edwardes had somehow died there
Dr Petersen and Brown go to the Gabriel Valley ski resort to reenact the event
Near the bottom of the hill Brown s memory suddenly returns
He recalls that there is a precipice in front of them over which Edwardes had fallen to his death
He stops them just in time
He also remembers a traumatic event from his childhood he slid down a hand rail with his brother at the bottom accidentally knocking him onto sharp pointed railings killing him
This incident had caused him to develop a guilt complex
He also remembers that his real name is John Ballantyne
All is understood now and Ballantyne is about to be exonerated when it is discovered that Edwardes had a bullet in his body
Ballantyne is convicted of murder and sent to prison
A heartbroken Dr Petersen returns to her position at the hospital where Dr Murchison is once again the director
Murchison lets slip that he had known Edwardes slightly and didn t like him contradicting his earlier claims
Now suspicious Dr Petersen reconsiders her notes from the dream and realizes that the wheel was a revolver and that the man hiding behind the chimney and dropping the wheel was Dr Murchison who shot Edwardes and then dropped the gun
Petersen confronts Murchison
He confesses but explains that he still has the gun and threatens to kill her
She walks away the gun still pointed at her explaining that while the first murder was committed under the extenuating circumstances of Dr Murchison s fragile mental state her murder would certainly lead him to the electric chair
He allows her to leave then turns the gun on himself
Dr Petersen is reunited with Ballantyne
They honeymoon together from the same Grand Central Station where they first tried to pursue the mystery of his psychosis

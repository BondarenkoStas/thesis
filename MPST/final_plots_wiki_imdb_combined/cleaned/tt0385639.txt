Long ago a demon fell in love with a woman and conjured up a bed on which to make love to her
The woman died during the act and in his grief the demon wept tears of blood which fell on the bed and caused it to come to life
While the demon rests the bed s evil is contained but once every ten years the demon wakes giving the bed the power to physically eat human beings
Only one man an artist identified as Aubrey Beardsley was spared as the bed condemned him to immortality behind a painting where he must forever witness the bed taking victims
The bed passed from owner to owner until the present day
Breakfast A young couple trespass into the building and discover the bed
They make love on the bed and the bed devours them
The artist mocks the bed for its stupidity
Enraged the bed telekinetically destroys most of the house except for the room it is in
Lunch Three women discover the now destroyed house
The bed eats one of the young women but reacts to one of the other women by bleeding in agony
The artist realizes that the bed reacts with pain to the woman because she resembles its mother
Elsewhere the brother of one of the women goes out looking for her
Dinner One of the two remaining women sleeps on the bed
She wakes before it can eat her but as she tries to escape the bed snares her in its sheets and drags her back to be eaten
The last woman unsuccessfully tries to save her
The brother locates the surviving woman only to have the bed trap them both to eat later
Meanwhile the bed tortures them both with nightmares
Just Desserts The brother tries to distract the bed in order for the remaining woman to escape but instead it kills him too
At that moment the demon that created the bed briefly falls asleep which renders the bed powerless and allows the artist to communicate with the woman
The artist describes a ritual that will destroy the bed
The woman carries out the ritual which teleports the bed out of the room and revives the bed s real mother but at the cost of killing the surviving woman
The bed s mother and the demon complete the ritual by having sex causing the bed to burst into flames and allowing the artist to finally die

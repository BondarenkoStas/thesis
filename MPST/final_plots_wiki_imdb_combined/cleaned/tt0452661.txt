Set in the same fictional universe as the Deathlands series but separated by a century Outlanders follows the adventures of a core group of explorers Kane Grant Brigid Baptiste and Domi who operate out of a secret military base known as the Cerberus Redoubt
Although both Deathlands and Outlanders bear the James Axler byline the latter series is primarily written by its creator Mark Ellis whereas multiple authors produce Deathlands
Two hundred years after a nuclear holocaust devastated the Earth the chaos and barbarism as depicted in the Deathlands series gave way to a centralized despotic government ruled by nine mysterious barons
Material taken from redoubts secret preholocaust military installations with stores of weapons and the home of the gateways MAT TRANS devices supplied the baronial rule in what was known as the Program of Unification Rearmed from redoubt stockpiles the barons consolidated their power and reclaimed very advanced technology created two centuries before by the so called Totality Concept
Their power bolstered by the invisible authority known only to an elite few as the Archons extended beyond the fortified city states into what came to be called the Outlands
There the rootstock of humanity survived eking out an existence in hellzones and hounded by black armored Magistrates the enforcers of the barons laws
When Cobaltville Magistrates Kane and Grant came across a piece of misplaced technology and Brigid Baptiste an archivist began an investigation on their behalf they found themselves branded as sedititionists their citizenship stripped from them and they were reclassified as Outlanders
Since 1997 s Exile To Hell the first book in the series the heroes and heroines of Outlanders slowly uncovered the truth behind the barons the Archons and the nuclear holocaust and finally the hidden history of humanity
They learn that Earth and humankind has been influenced since the dawn of time by the reptilian Anunnaki and the Tuatha Dé Danann
They realize that the baronies are a revival of the god king system of ancient Sumeria
Besides the nine barons other threats arise in the early books namely Sindri a brilliant but deranged dwarf who rules a secret colony on Mars
First appearing in Parallax Red Sindri becomes the most persistent foe of the Cerberus warriors appearing in several novels
Other recurring enemies include Colonel Thrush Sam the Imperator Grigori Zakat and Maccan the last prince of the Tuatha Dé Danann
In Shadow Scourge the heroes contend with Ocajinik apparently one of H P Lovecraft s Old Ones
In Children of the Serpent the Cerberus warriors discover that the nuclear holocaust and the institution of the baronies were part of an ancient plan formulated over a thousand years before by Enlil the last Anunnaki on Earth in order to reincarnate the pantheon of Sumerian gods and re establish their rule over the world
The reincarnated Enlil becomes the Outlanders main villain
He is considerably more evil and powerful than any of the barons and has much of the knowledge and technology of the Anunnaki
Employing conspiracy theories and myths from all cultures as underpinnings Outlanders quickly distanced itself from the survivalist tone of Deathlands and struck out in new directions providing explanations and a backstory for many of the unresolved science fiction elements in the earlier series

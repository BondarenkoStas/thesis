Simple abstract geometric shapes move and morph on the screen to harpsichord music from a French Suite by J S Bach
The voice of an audience member who claims to be 71 complains throughout the film despite being told repeatedly by other audience members to keep quiet
The onscreen images feature geometric patterns
The cranky and clueless old man is trying to make sense of them and describes what he sees at various points including a squiggle a fence a cockroach
The old man finds that certain images remind him of the biology classes of his Russian boyhood
When two abstract shapes approach each other and unite the old man sees it as a mating sequence
They like each other
Sure
Lookit da sparks
Two things in love
Could dis be the sex life of two things
When the scene shifts from the mating to other abstract images the old man gets bored
He proclaims the images must be symbolism then adds that they are symbolism of junk
He eventually concludes that some of the images depicting lips are dirty obscene
He admits at some point that he was looking for a hot French picture which he hoped would involve nudity
The implication is that the old man is in the wrong movie theater probably one screening art films
He also wonders why the creator of the film wasted his time with this
He points that this creator could instead do something meaningful like driving a truck or do something constructive like working in shoemaking

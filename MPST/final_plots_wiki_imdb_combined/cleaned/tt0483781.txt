The game is set after the events of Prince of Persia Warrior Within in which the Prince kills the Dahaka saves Kaileena and prevents the Sands of Time from being created
Unlike the previous games the story is narrated by Kaileena
The Prince s actions alter the timeline of events that took place before that point
In the original timeline the Vizier and Maharajah traveled to the Island of Time and found an hourglass filled with the Sands of Time
In the modified timeline they find the hourglass empty
Since the Vizier never released the Sands of Time and fought the Prince he is still alive at the beginning of this game
Farah who helped the Prince during the events for Sands of Time has never met the Prince
As The Prince and Kaileena return to the city of Babylon they find it being ravaged by war
Their ship is attacked and destroyed and he and Kaileena wash ashore
The Prince awakens and watches as enemy soldiers take Kaileena away
The Prince fights his way into the palace and confronts the Vizier who kills Kaileena with the Dagger of Time unleashing the Sands again
The Vizier then impales himself with it and makes himself immortal
The Prince is also affected having a whip like weapon known as a Daggertail embedded in his skin when the Sands infect the wound
However in the confusion following the release of the Sands the Vizier throws the Dagger aside and the Prince manages to steal it before the Sands infected him completely
The Prince falls into the sewers and gets carried to the outskirts of Babylon
As he travels through the city once again to kill the Vizier he finds that the infection caused by the Sands of Time is affecting his mind giving rise to an alter ego called the Dark Prince manifested by a voice within
The Dark Prince is cold cruel arrogant and sarcastic he attempts to convince the Prince that he should strive to serve only himself using his vengeance as a catalyst for his other emotions
On many occasions the Dark Prince seizes control of the Prince s body and the Prince is fully transformed into a hybrid sand monster with abilities that allow the Prince to pass otherwise insurmountable obstacles
Later the Prince encounters Farah who is surprised that the Prince knows her name
Despite this the pair begin to grow an entirely new romance together
The Prince eventually starts to ignore the Dark Prince and begins to fight against the suffering of his people which the Dark Prince had always spoken against
In the palace gardens the Vizier captures Farah and casts the Prince into an ancient well where the long silent Dark Prince emerges once again and tries to take permanent control
The Prince desperately tries to resist the power driving slowly deeper into the well looking for an escape but he slowly weakens
At the bottom of the well the Prince stumbles upon the dead body of his father Sharaman
He mourns for Sharaman accepting the consequences of what he has done and wields his father s sword to resist the Dark Prince s power
At the top of the Tower of Babel the Prince confronts and kills The Vizier with the Dagger of Time
The Sands released from the Vizier slowly takes the shape of Kaileena who cleanses the Prince s infection and disappears
As the Prince finds Sharaman s crown the Dark Prince takes it and lures the Prince into his mind where the two struggle until the Prince abandons his shadow
The game ends with Farah asking how the Prince knows her name and the Prince beginning to tell his story

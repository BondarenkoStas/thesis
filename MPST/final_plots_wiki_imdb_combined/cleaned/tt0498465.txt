A goat named Mei wanders into a barn one night seeking shelter from a storm
In the barn the goat meets another refugee
The two can neither see nor smell each other but nevertheless they huddle together fending off the cold and begin to talk
Eventually they establish a friendship
The two decide to meet later and will recognize each other by using the password one stormy night
The next day when they meet Mei learns that his companion from the night before was a wolf named Gabu
Despite their natural predisposition as enemies they share a common bond and begin meeting regularly
However Mei s flock and Gabu s pack eventually find out about their relationship and forbid the friendship
In a truly underhanded tactic the pack and flock attempt to force Mei and Gabu to use each other to get information on their enemies
Mei and Gabu no longer wanting to bound by their respective clan s unjust regulations and hoping to preserve their friendship cross a river during a storm
They hope to find an emerald forest free from persecution
However Giro the leader of Gabu s pack holds a grudge against goats and views Gabu as a traitor to all wolves
Giro and his pack begin to hunt down the two companions
Gabu and Mei reach the summit of a mountain where they stop and rest exhausted from fighting their way through a snowstorm
Mei knowing that Gabu has not eaten in days offers to sacrifice himself as sustenance
Gabu agrees initially but soon realizes that no matter how hungry he is he cannot eat his friend
Gabu hears his pack approaching and leaves Mei to face them ready to defend his goat friend to the death
As Gabu is about to go face the wolf pack there is an avalanche which sweeps them all away
The next morning Mei digs through the snow blocking the cave and sees the emerald forest they had been searching for in the distance
Gabu is missing but Mei finds him in another cave
Mei finds that Gabu has lost his memory of their friendship and all the events that preceded the avalanche due to the trauma of surviving that disaster and Mei knows not how to undo the damage
While waiting for the moon to come out Gabu taunts Mei that he plans on eating him
Mei saying that he wouldn t have minded being eaten by Gabu before accuses the wolf of not being the Gabu he previously knew and deems him pathetic for not even attempting to remember his past
Disappointed and disillusioned Mei shouts that had he known things would take this turn it would have been better if they had never met each other on one stormy night
On hearing these words Gabu s memory slowly returns in flashes before in a rapid burst
After regaining himself Gabu turns to Mei and speaks his name as well as wondering why they are in the cave having no recollection of his time while amnesiac
A stunned and overjoyed Mei deciding it would not matter to tell Gabu about his amnesia claims to have been waiting for Gabu this whole time and they happily reunite
In the end Mei and Gabu both enjoy watching the moon as it rises marveling at its beauty and swearing that their friendship will last forever no matter what
Giro and the wolf pack are shown to have survived the avalanche and are seen running away back to their home gorge

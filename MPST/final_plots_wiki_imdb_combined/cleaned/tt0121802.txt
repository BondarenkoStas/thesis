After years of saving a small town its population is angered that The Lone Ranger never stays long enough to receive gratitude for his deeds
After being pressed on the issue the Lone Ranger explains why with a hypothetical situation a little boy tells the Ranger Thank you mask man The simple phrase resonates with the Ranger who soon demands to hear the phrase every time he performs a deed
One day in the far future no more thank you mask man greetings come prophets explain that the Messiah has arrived and that the Lone Ranger is no longer needed
Now addicted to thank you mask man the Lone Ranger turns evil vowing to make trouble so that he can fix it and receive his thank you mask man again
Back in reality the Ranger explains that he does not want to fall into such a trap and that is why he rides away before accepting anything in return
The townspeople are still annoyed at this and insist on giving the Lone Ranger some sort of gift
The Lone Ranger points to an Indian Tonto and says that he wants him
Asked why The Lone Ranger wants Tonto he replies To perform an unnatural act
explaining that he is not a homosexual but that he had heard a lot about it and read expos√©s and would like to try now to see how bad it is
Just once
The Lone Ranger also requests a horse
When asked why he wanted the horse he replied The act
suggesting that he wants to perform bestiality
The townspeople react in disgust as The Lone Ranger and Tonto ride off into the sunset

The Fifth Seal is a study in depersonalization
Set in Budapest 1944 towards the end of World War II it tells the story of a group of friends hanging out in a bar owned by Béla drinking talking and having as good a time as they can trying to stay out of trouble
Miklós a watchmaker László a book seller and János a carpenter are one night joined by a fifth man who asks an innocent question Just imagine you are about to die but you will be reincarnated in to one of two people a slave or the rich master
The slave suffers under the master
He has his tongue and an eye removed and his wife and child are killed
He goes on living knowing he is a good person as he never committed such appalling sadistic acts on another like his master has done
The rich master has no moral qualms about it at all
He doesn t think what he did was wrong the slave needed to be punished
You have the choice whether to be a poor and righteous slave or be a rich and corrupt master
This hypothetical question changes their lives

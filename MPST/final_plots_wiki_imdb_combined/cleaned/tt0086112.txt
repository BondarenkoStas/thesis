Act I On the coast of Cornwall at the time of Queen Victoria s reign Frederic celebrates the completion of his twenty first year and the end of his apprenticeship to a gentlemanly band of pirates
The pirates maid of all work Ruth appears and reveals that as Frederic s nursemaid long ago she made a mistake through being hard of hearing Mishearing Frederic s father s instructions she apprenticed him to a pirate instead of to a ship s pilot
Frederic has never seen any woman other than Ruth and he believes her to be beautiful
The pirates know better and suggest that Frederic take Ruth with him when he returns to civilisation
Frederic announces that although it pains him so strong is his sense of duty that once free from his apprenticeship he will be forced to devote himself to the pirates extermination
He also points out that they are not successful pirates since they are all orphans they allow their prey to go free if they too are orphans
Frederic notes that word of this has got about so captured ships companies routinely claim to be orphans
Frederic invites the pirates to give up piracy and go with him so that he need not destroy them but the Pirate King says that compared with respectability piracy is comparatively honest
The pirates depart leaving Frederic and Ruth
Frederic sees a group of beautiful young girls approaching the pirate lair and realises that Ruth misled him about her appearance
Sending Ruth away Frederic hides before the girls arrive
The girls burst exuberantly upon the secluded spot
Frederic reveals himself and appeals to them to help him reform
One of them Mabel responds to his plea chiding her sisters for their lack of charity
She offers Frederic her pity and the two quickly fall in love
The other girls discuss whether to eavesdrop or to leave the new couple alone deciding to talk about the weather although they steal glances at the affectionate couple
Frederic warns the girls about the pirates but before they can flee the pirates return and capture all the girls intending to marry them
Mabel warns the pirates that the girls father is a Major General who soon arrives and introduces himself
He appeals to the pirates not to take his daughters leaving him to face his old age alone
Having heard of the famous Pirates of Penzance he pretends that he is an orphan to elicit their sympathy
The soft hearted pirates release the girls making Major General Stanley and his daughters honorary members of their band
Act II The Major General sits in a ruined chapel on his estate surrounded by his daughters
His conscience is tortured by the lie that he told the pirates and the girls attempt to console him
The Sergeant of Police and his corps arrive to announce their readiness to arrest the pirates
The girls loudly express their admiration of the police for facing likely slaughter at the hands of fierce and merciless foes
The police are unnerved by this but finally leave
Left alone Frederic who is to lead the police reflects on his opportunity to atone for a life of piracy at which point he encounters Ruth and the Pirate King
They have realised that Frederic s apprenticeship was worded so as to bind him to them until his twenty first birthday and because that birthday happens to be on the 29th of February it means that technically only five birthdays have passed and he will not reach his twenty first birthday until he is in his eighties
Frederic is convinced by this logic and agrees to rejoin the pirates
He then sees it as his duty to inform the Pirate King of the Major General s deception
The outraged outlaw declares that the pirates revenge will be swift and terrible
Frederic meets Mabel and she pleads with him to stay but he feels bound by his duty to the pirates until his 21st birthday in 1940
They agree to be faithful to each other until then though to Mabel It seems so long Frederic departs
Mabel steels herself and tells the police that they must go alone to face the pirates
They muse that an outlaw might be just like any other man and it is a shame to deprive him of that liberty which is so dear to all
The police hide on hearing the approach of the pirates who have stolen onto the estate intending to avenge themselves for the Major General s lie
Just then Major General Stanley appears sleepless with guilt and the pirates also hide while the Major General listens to the soothing breeze
The girls come looking for him
The pirates leap to the attack and the police rush to the defence but the police are easily defeated and the Pirate King urges the captured Major General to prepare for death
The Sergeant has one stratagem left he demands that the pirates yield in Queen Victoria s name the pirates overcome with loyalty to their Queen do so
Ruth appears and reveals that the pirates are all noblemen who have gone wrong
The Major General is impressed by this and all is forgiven
Frederic and Mabel are reunited and the Major General is happy to marry his daughters to the noble pirates after all

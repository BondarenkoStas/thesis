Gelsomina and her three younger sisters live with their parents on a farm in the Italian countryside
As the eldest child she takes on a heavier burden taking care of her younger sisters and assisting her father with bee keeping
One day as the family is playing on the beach after a long day they are told to quit making so much noise and discover that a short distance away a TV show is being filmed
They watch the show being filmed and as they are about to leave the star of the show Milly calls them over and gives Gelsomina a hair clip to keep
Watching the program they were filming on TV Gelsomina learns that the program is launching a competition called Countryside Wonders in which seven farmers will compete to have their products featured on the show
While her father Wolfgang is violently against the family competing her mother warms to the idea despite the fact that the standards of their honey production are not up to par
Meanwhile Wolfgang hires a juvenile delinquent named Martin to work on the farm
Martin never talks thinking that he will be able to help with the honey production
Though Wolfgang tries to favor Martin he eventually discovers that he is an ineffectual worker
Unbeknownst to her father Gelsomina fills out an application for her family to compete in Countryside Wonders
She forgets about the application after an old friend of her father comes to stay in the house and when while switching out the honeycombs to put in the processor she accidentally injures her younger sister Marinella
At the hospital while Marinella is being stitched up Gelsomina realizes that before they left they forgot to change the bucket which collects the processed honey and on returning home find honey spilled over the floor
At the same time they are visited by a man from Countryside Wonders who is there to see if their production room is up to par
The children manage to clean the work area and they are allowed to compete
However Wolfgang is infuriated by the news
Nevertheless the family goes to compete on the show where they are dressed up in ridiculous garb and each contestant must plead their case in front of the judges
On TV Wolfgang freezes and is unable to explain what makes his honey so special
However Gelsomina steps up and with Martin performs a trick in which he whistles and bees crawl out of her mouth onto her face
The family loses the competition however
Martin runs away and Gelsomina follows him but is unable to find him
On the last boat ride back to the island she finds herself alone with Milly who takes off her wig and gives Gelsomina a hairpin
Because they lost the competition and have no money the family is forced to leave the farm
Before they go they discuss leaving something behind under the floorboards in secret for someone else to discover later

Villains In some versions her father plays an active role in the humiliation of his daughter in others he is secondary to his new wife Cinderella s stepmother in some versions especially the popular Disney film Cinderella s father has died and Cinderella s mother has died also
Although many variants of Cinderella feature the wicked stepmother the defining trait of type 510A is a female persecutor in Fair Brown and Trembling and Finette Cendron the stepmother does not appear at all and it is the older sisters who confine her to the kitchen
In other fairy tales featuring the ball she was driven from home by the persecutions of her father usually because he wished to marry her
Of this type are Cap O Rushes Catskin All Kinds of Fur and Allerleirauh and she slaves in the kitchen because she found a job there
In Katie Woodencloak the stepmother drives her from home and she likewise finds such a job
In La Cenerentola Gioachino Rossini inverted the sex roles Cenerentola is oppressed by her stepfather
He also made the economic basis for such hostility unusually clear in that Don Magnifico wishes to make his own daughters dowries larger to attract a grander match which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry
Folklorists often interpret the hostility between the stepmother and stepdaughter as just such a competition for resources but seldom does the tale make it clear
Ball Ballgown and Curfew The number of balls varies sometimes one sometimes two and sometimes three
The fairy godmother is Perrault s own addition to the tale
The person who aided Cinderella in the Grimms s version is her dead mother
Aschenputtel requests her aid by praying at her grave on which a tree is growing
Helpful doves roosting in the tree shake down the clothing she needs for the ball
This motif is found in other variants of the tale as well such as The Cinder Maid collected by Joseph Jacobs and the Finnish The Wonderful Birch
Playwright James Lapine incorporated this motif into the Cinderella plotline of the musical Into the Woods
Giambattista Basile s Cenerentola combined them the Cinderella figure Zezolla asks her father to commend her to the Dove of Fairies and ask her to send her something and she receives a tree that will provide her clothing
Other variants have her helped by talking animals as in Katie Woodencloak Rushen Coatie Bawang Putih Bawang Merah The Story of Tam and Cam or The Sharp Grey Sheep these animals often having some connection with her dead mother in The Golden Slipper a fish aids her after she puts it in water
In The Anklet it s a magical alabaster pot the girl purchased with her own money that brings her the gowns and the anklets she wears to the ball
Gioachino Rossini having agreed to do an opera based on Cinderella if he could omit all magical elements wrote La Cenerentola in which she was aided by Alidoro a philosopher and formerly the Prince s tutor
The midnight curfew is also absent in many versions Cinderella leaves the ball to get home before her stepmother and stepsisters or she is simply tired
In the Grimms version Aschenputtel slips away when she is tired hiding on her father s estate in a tree and then the pigeon coop to elude her pursuers her father tries to catch her by chopping them down but she escapes
Furthermore the gathering need not be a ball several variants on Cinderella such as Katie Woodencloak and The Golden Slipper have her attend church
In the three ball version Cinderella keeps a close watch on the time the first two nights and is able to leave without difficulty
However on the third night she loses track of the time and must flee the castle before her disguise vanishes
In her haste she loses a glass slipper which the prince finds or else the prince has carefully had her exit tarred so as to catch her and the slipper is caught in it
The identifying item The glass slipper is unique to Charles Perrault s version and its derivatives in other versions of the tale it may be made of other materials and in still other tellings it is not a slipper but an anklet a ring or a bracelet that gives the prince the key to Cinderella s identity
In Rossini s opera La Cenerentola the slipper is replaced by twin bracelets to prove her identity
In the Finnish variant The Wonderful Birch the prince uses tar to gain something every ball and so has a ring a circlet and a pair of slippers
Interpreters unaware of the value attached to glass in 17th century France and perhaps troubled by sartorial impracticalities have suggested that Perrault s glass slipper had been a squirrel fur slipper in some unidentified earlier version of the tale and that Perrault or one of his sources confused the words however most scholars believe the glass slipper was a deliberate piece of poetic invention on Perrault s part
The 1950 Disney adaptation takes advantage of the slipper being made of glass to add a twist whereby the slipper is shattered just before Cinderella has the chance to try it on leaving her with only the matching slipper with which to prove her identity
Another interpretation of verre vair suggested a sexual element the Prince was trying on the fur slipper of the maidens in the kingdom as a Droit du seigneur right of sexual possession of his subjects
The disguised Cinderella s fur slipper was of unique appeal to the Prince who sought her thereafter through sexual congress
The translation of the story into cultures with different standards of beauty has left the significance of Cinderella s shoe size unclear and resulted in the implausibility of Cinderella s feet being of a unique size for no particular reason
Humorous retellings of the story sometimes use the twist of having the shoes turn out to also fit somebody completely unsuitable such as an amorous old crone
In Terry Pratchett s Witches Abroad the witches accuse another witch of manipulating the events because it was a common shoe size and she could only ensure that the right woman put it on if she already knew where she was and went straight to her
In When the Clock Strikes Tanith Lee had the sorcerous shoe alter shape whenever a woman tried to put it on so it would not fit
The Revelation Cinderella s stepmother and stepsisters conspire to win the prince s hand for one of them
In the German telling the first stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off a toe but the doves in the hazel tree alert the prince to the blood dripping from the slipper and he returns the false bride to her mother
The second stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off her heel but the same doves give her away
In many variants of the tale the prince is told that Cinderella can not possibly be the one as she is too dirty and ragged
Often this is said by the stepmother or stepsisters
In the Grimms version both the stepmother and the father urge it
The prince nevertheless insists on her trying
Cinderella arrives and proves her identity by fitting into the slipper or other item
The Conclusion In the German version of the story the evil stepsisters are punished for their deception by having their eyes pecked out by birds
In other versions they are forgiven and made ladies in waiting with marriages to lesser lords
In The Thousand Nights and A Night in a tale called The Anklet the stepsisters make a comeback by using twelve magical hairpins to turn the bride into a dove on her wedding night
In The Wonderful Birch the stepmother a witch manages to substitute her daughter for the true bride after she has given birth
Such tales continue the fairy tale into what is in effect a second episode
In an episode of Jim Henson s The Storyteller writer Anthony Minghella merged the old folk tale Donkeyskin with Cinderella to tell the tale of Sapsorrow a girl both cursed and blessed by destiny
Many popular new works based on the story feature one step sister who is not as cruel to Cinderella as the other

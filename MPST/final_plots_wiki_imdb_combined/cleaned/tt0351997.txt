Narrated by Patrick Stewart the game s plot is built around the Prime Sentinels retrieving the head of Bastion and Bastion s subsequent attempt to wipe out mutant kind
The game opens with the Prime Sentinels freeing Bastion from S H I E L D
imprisonment and then disguising themselves and selling the defense plans of Professor Xavier s School for Gifted Youngsters to the Brotherhood the training grounds and home of the X Men
The game then moves forward to Forge fighting off Mystique and Nightcrawler in a city ravaged by a Prime Sentinel invasion
The graves of Anthony Stark Warren Worthington III Peter Parker and Benjamin Grimm can be seen in the background
This is revealed to be a Danger Room simulation and the X Men begin training their adaptivity by fighting opponents who have a tactical advantage
During this training session Juggernaut and the Brotherhood of Mutants make their assault on the mansion
Xavier is curious as to the nature of their attack worrying that it seems too focused almost like a distraction and sends Forge to investigate the grounds
He discovers that the attack was a distraction and that the grounds are now being patrolled by Prime Sentinels
After attempting to fight off the Sentinels Forge is abducted and the Brotherhood retreats
Restrained in the company of Bastion the seemingly human Sentinel tells Forge he intends to use the man s mutant gift to bring about the extinction of mutants
He steals various weapon designs from Forge s mind including a powerful weapon capable of stripping a mutant of their powers
In an attempt to throw the X Men off his scent He sends the Brotherhood to different locations across the world
The X Men split up and engage each member in a bid to find Forge and stop the Prime Sentinel
After their defeat the Brotherhood retreats to find Magneto in the Savage Land only to find that Magneto has been hunted down by the Sentinels as well and is no longer in control of his fortress
The X Men having followed the Brotherhood also arrive and Magneto charges the Brotherhood to fight them off long enough to convince them to join forces
With the X Men and the Brotherhood forming a temporary alliance the team fights their way through a legion of Sentinels though not without losses of their own
In the end Magneto Wolverine Juggernaut and Phoenix invade the tower for the final battle with Bastion
Bastion uses Magneto s trans mat system to transport Juggernaut away from the tower then escapes to Asteroid M but he is followed by a piggybacking Wolverine
Wolverine whose healing factor was disabled by the Sentinels earlier manages to defeat Bastion
Magneto and Phoenix arrive to help Wolverine and Magneto prevents a weakened Bastion from escaping again
The two battle and Magneto is defeated
When Bastion returns to the central room he finds Phoenix who challenges and finally defeats him
The Prime Sentinels are disbanded and the X Men and the Brotherhood agree to a temporary cease fire while the wounded are restored to health
Forge is freed and reverses the effects of his weapon restoring everything to normal
With Bastion returned to S H I E L D the X Men are free to continue training to fight for a better future

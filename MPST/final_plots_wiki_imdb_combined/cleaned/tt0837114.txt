Five years after the events of Dead Rising former motocross champion Chuck Greene is in the fictional casino town of Fortune City Nevada to take part in Terror is Reality a controversial sports entertainment game show where contestants kill zombies for money and fame
Chuck needs the prize money to buy Zombrex for his daughter Katey who was bitten by her zombified mother during a previous outbreak in Las Vegas when she was only 4 years old
While Chuck is backstage after the show the show s supply of zombies is released Chuck rescues Katey and makes his way to an emergency shelter which is sealed after their arrival
Raymond Sullivan is initially reluctant to let the infected Katey in but Chuck promises to keep her supplied with Zombrex until the military arrives in three days
Chuck needs to venture into the overrun city to find a dose of Zombrex entering and exiting the shelter via an air duct
Another survivor Stacey Forsythe supplies him with a map and two way radio she promises to keep watch on the shelter s security monitors and direct Chuck to any other survivors or points of interest in the area
After returning with the first dose of Zombrex for Katey a news report implicates Chuck as the cause of the Fortune City outbreak
Chuck tracks down the reporter Rebecca Chang at a nearby hotel and offers her the story of a lifetime if she gives him a chance to prove his innocence and helps him determine who was really behind the outbreak
Following this Chuck has three main objectives to complete discover the origin of the Fortune City outbreak by following the Case File missions rescue as many survivors as possible and find enough doses of Zombrex to keep Katey alive until the military arrives
Chuck and Rebecca discover that Terror is Reality host Tyrone TK King is using the outbreak as cover to rob Fortune City s four main casinos
Chuck foils the robberies and prevents the host from escaping in his helicopter
TK is locked up in the shelter and reveals that another organization responsible for the outbreak paid him to frame Chuck for it
Three days after the outbreak the military arrives but a green gas begins emanating from underground and causes zombies to mutate into a more powerful form
The convoy is unprepared to deal with the super zombies and is wiped out almost completely
A second military force would normally arrive 24 hours later but media reports claim that the first convoy reached the shelter and found no survivors so the city will be cleansed by firebombing at that time
The safe house is also sabotaged and Chuck must quickly repair the door before too many zombies enter
Regardless of the player s actions TK is bitten and needs Zombrex to survive
Rebecca reveals the cause of the gas seems to be in the underground access tunnels and Chuck finds a hidden facility where pharmaceutical company Phenotrans the makers of Zombrex is harvesting the zombies
The drug is manufactured from the queens of the genetically modified wasps that create zombies the gas released by the Phenotrans facility is intended to increase the number of queens in a zombie horde
After killing the scientists in charge of the harvesting Chuck recovers a satellite phone and a laptop from the facility and takes them to Rebecca as proof that Phenotrans orchestrated the outbreak in order to harvest more queens while driving up demand for Zombrex
Just as Rebecca attempts to contact her news station and report the discovery Sullivan shoots her dead
Sullivan is revealed as a Phenotrans operative he was the one who let the Terror is Reality zombies out while framing Chuck and the one who sabotaged the shelter
He escapes with the phone and laptop and Chuck follows him to a casino rooftop where he plans to escape by skyhook after revealing that the Vegas and Fortune City outbreaks were necessary to keep a consistent supply of queens to make Zombrex enraging Chuck as his wife was killed in the Vegas outbreak which led to Katey getting infected in the first place
After a fierce battle Chuck handcuffs Sullivan s harness to the rooftop ripping him in half when the recovery aircraft catches the skyhook
Chuck contacts Rebecca s channel and offers to give them proof of Phenotrans involvement in the Fortune City outbreak if they send helicopters to rescue the survivors
Endings The two primary endings are Ending S Chuck calls off the bombing
He arrives back at the shelter to find the civilians being evacuated but Stacey and Katey are not among them

Chuck does so but is tasered on arrival by TK and wakes up suspended over a pit of zombies alongside Katey and Stacey
Chuck frees himself and climbs up to the rafters where he fights TK
After overpowering TK and throwing him to the zombies Chuck frees the other two and they leave the city hand in hand
A zombie then screams into the camera giving the players one last scare
This ending was the original canon ending of the game before the release of Dead Rising 2 Case West although in E3 2013 the developers confirmed this ending as canon so it is possible that TK zombifies after the fall and the rest plays out like Ending A thus making this ending possibly canon with Case West

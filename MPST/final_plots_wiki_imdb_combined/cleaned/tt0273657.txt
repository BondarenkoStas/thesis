At the tribunal in Jamaica the officers on the Renown are being charged with mutiny Flashback to the Renown in St Domingo
The men killed in the skirmish at the fort are being given a proper burial at sea
First Lt Buckland is now the acting captain
Captain Sawyer is in his cabin restrained by a straightjacket
He makes odd statements it s obvious that he is unwell mentally
First Lt Buckland is anxious to get underway and head for Jamaica But Horatio proposes that the Renown make another try at attacking the fort
He feels that with surprise on their side it will be a victory
Horatio thinks that this victory would help the officers of the Renown during the mutiny trial that they are sure to face once they arrive in Jamaica
But Buckland is convinced that they will have nothing to fear in Jamaica and because Bush doesn t support Horatio s plan Buckland decides against attacking the fort and continues to plot their course for Jamaica Flashforward to the trial
Dr Clive is still strongly supporting Captain Sawyer even though he agreed that Sawyer was unfit for command during the battle at the fort when the officers took command from Sawyer
He testifies that he agreed to declare Sawyer unfit under duress from Horatio Flashback to the Renown
Bush Kennedy and Hornblower discuss Horatio s plan to attack the fort
Bush admits he was wrong not to support him with Buckland
They all agree that they should move forward with the plan and attack the fort Meanwhile Gunner Hobbs is talking with Seaman Randall
Randall and some other men are planning to desert the Renown
He invites Hobbs to join them but Hobbs is unwilling to desert his Captain to leave him at the mercy of the other officers
Hobbs does assist the desertion though by clubbing the marine on watch and knocking him out
More marines are attacked by the deserters as they prepare to leave the ship
Randall s last action before climbing off the Renown is to punch Hobbs in the face knocking him out
He and the rest of the deserters swim for shore under the cover of darkness
They are seen coming out of the water on a beach of the island where the fort is Flash forward to Jamaica Horatio testifies that the reason he and the other officers wanted to press on with the attack was to fulfill their duty to their captain and to the service
Admiral Hammond suggests that Horatio is ambitious
Pellew continues to be fair and shows support for Hornblower Flashback to the Renown
Matthews is seen rousing the seamen from their sleep
He discovers that many have deserted and quickly informs the rest
Buckland is concerned now that so many men are found to have deserted so he agrees to Horatio s plan to attack the fort
He feels that the officers of the Renown will need this victory to save them from hanging for mutiny Four boats of seamen and marines row to the island from the Renown
It is nearly daybreak
Horatio Bush Wellard and Hobbs are with them
As they begin hiking toward the fort they discover the deserters all dead but they have no idea how that came to happen Flashforward to Jamaica
Hammond tells Pellew that they will need a guilty party on whom to blame the mutiny
They seem reluctant to ruin Captain Sawyer s career Flashback to the island
Day is beginning to break
As the attack force makes their way toward the fort the 3 4 men who remained behind to guard their boats are attacked by natives On the Renown Sawyer rambles on and on taunting Buckland and making him doubt himself while Clive watches and listens
Sawyer tries to convince Buckland to release him promising to speak on his behalf when they get to Jamaica
Clive tries to get Sawyer to keep quiet
Buckland orders Clive to give Sawyer more laudenum The rowboats filled with native men approach the Renown
Buckland realizes they are freed slaves from the island
The freemen want the Renown to leave claiming they have no business in this fight Back at the island the officers prepare to attack but Buckland s weakness in command has led to shots being fired from the ship so the element of surprise is lost for the attack force on the island The attack on the fort begins
Horatio notices that one of the Spanish soldiers atop the main fort is the same man they d noticed earlier on top of the tower
He tells Archie about it
Archie agrees it s the same man so he Horatio Wellard and Matthews return to a lower position where they had earlier stashed some kegs of gunpowder
They take several kegs of powder and return up the trail toward the fort
They re looking for something along the slope Matthews notices a grate on the ground which leads to a tunnel below
Wellard is the only one of the group who is small enough to fit through the grate so the others lower him head first into the hole
At the bottom he hears Spanish soldiers approaching
Horatio warns him to run for safety while he and the others light a fuse to ignite a keg of powder which they have placed over the grate
Just as the Spanish soldiers arrive below the grate the powder keg explodes killing them
With the grate removed Horatio and the others may now climb down into the tunnel where they make their way toward the fort
A small group of Spanish soldiers are ready to attack them but they run back the other way to avoid being shot Meanwhile Bush the marines and the other seamen are being fired upon heavily
It seems to be hopeless
Bush is about to surrender his sword to the Spanish commander when an explosion blows the door of the fort open right in front of them
It is Horatio and the other men they exploded more kegs of powder to defend their position
The blast also saves the rest of the attack party in front of the fort
Horatio and the others quickly join the frontal assault
The Spanish are soon subdued so they surrender Bush and Horatio discuss how they can prevent 3 Spanish vessels from escaping the bay
Horatio suggests hot shots which are cannon balls heated in a fire until they are red hot they are then loaded into a cannon and shot
The balls explode like bombs when they hit a ship
They manage to disable one vessel s sails
Then the Renown arrives and fires on the three ships Flash forward to the tribunal in Jamaica
Again Horatio is being accused of ambition
He insists he was only doing his duty
Later Hammond tells Pellew that Hornblower seems guilty
Pellew explains that Horatio is very dear to him
Pellew will not rush to judgment he explains that he will weigh all facts carefully as will the others Flashback to the Renown
The Spanish commander surrenders
He informs Buckland that he would like to use the small fleet of three Spanish ships to leave the island with his men and their families
He insists that he knows they are beaten and he hopes Buckland will agree to this limited surrender
Buckland is inclined to go along with the idea but Horatio informs the Spanish Commander that he will receive an answer within an hour Horatio explains to Buckland that the Spanish seem too willing to give up their ships and fort so easily and too anxious to leave
Archie discovers that the food stores are nearly depleted at the fort
Horatio suggests that the island will soon be under siege from the band of freed slaves
He thinks they should find a way to impose a complete surrender on the Spanish taking the soldiers prisoner and the three Spanish vessels as prizes of the British navy Buckland invites the Spanish commander and his wife to dine aboard the Renown
In the mean time the other officers bring a cannon from the Renown to the top of the cliff overlooking the bay where the Spanish ships are moored
Captain Sawyer is still acting crazy
He gets loose and threatens Horatio with a razor blade
Horatio talks him out of it speaking of his past glories and how Horatio would not like to see Captain Sawyer s good name and achievements ruined by his present condition and actions
The cannon is successfully placed on the cliff At dinner with Buckland the Spanish commander and his wife become concerned that the other officers have not arrived for dinner yet
Buckland tries to stall
Suddenly they hear the sound of cannon fire
The commander and his wife protest
Buckland informs them that they are now the prisoners of the British navy and will have safe passage to Jamaica
Their ships will be safe as British prizes of war
Buckland asks for the commander s sword signaling that it is now an unconditional surrender Horatio Bush and the others watch as the Spanish ships take down their flags
They begin to cheer when suddenly they come under fire from the rebel forces above them on the cliff
They spike their cannon and fall back in retreat
Buckland watches form the Renown as they run down the slope toward shore and questions the Spanish commander asking him how long the island fort had been under siege Just then Captain Sawyer can be heard singing Spanish Ladies from down below
Buckland is irritated by the captain s behavior
He goes below to attempt to quiet him down
Sawyer taunts him and baits him making him doubt himself
He wants to convince Buckland that Horatio will outshine him and make him look foolish with the Admiralty
Sawyer even tells Buckland that unless he strikes first Horatio will take the Renown from him just as Horatio took the Renown from Sawyer
Dr Clive enters and Buckland orders him to give Sawyer more laudanum Flash forward to Jamaica
Pellew is questioning Buckland about his relationship with Horatio
He s trying to learn if Buckland harbors any ill feelings toward Horatio Flashback to the Renown
The attack party from shore has returned on board
Buckland informs Bush that it will be necessary to destroy the fort before they set sail again he hints that he wants Horatio to take charge of this mission
Horatio agrees saying it would be an honor to volunteer
Bush seems suspicious about Buckland s motives
Archie and Bush offer to assist but Buckland decides to keep Bush and Archie on the Renown
Flash forward to Jamaica
Pellew asks Buckland if he wanted Horatio to survive this mission
Buckland insists that he does not send men to their death Flash back to the Renown
Matthews is asking Buckland if he and Styles and some other men may escort Horatio and row him back to the Renown after his mission
Buckland denies the request saying they are needed on board
Meanwhile at the fort Horatio discovers that Archie and Bush have disregarded Buckland s orders and have come to help him after all
They fend off attacking rebels while Horatio sets up the powder kegs and charges
The fuse is lit they run through the underground tunnel and climb up through the grate
Just as they surface the powder explodes
The men on the Renown watch as the fort is destroyed
Hobbs tells Matthews and Styles Now you know what it s like to lose your hero
They tell Hobbs that Horatio will be back Hobbs tells Buckland Your victory is complete
Buckland tells Matthews it s time to set sail for Jamaica
Horatio Bush and Archie jump from the cliff into the sea
They are spotted by Styles and Matthews who inform Buckland
Buckland has no choice he must wait for them
Horatio has a hearty reunion with Matthews and Styles on board the Renown
Buckland places Horatio in charge of the three Spanish vessels he will be responsible for their safe return
Buckland seems uncomfortable Bush apologizes to Buckland for disobeying his orders and helping Horatio
Buckland replies that his actions were true to form
He thinks Bush Archie and Horatio are full of themselves he believes they think he is a fool
Bush replies that nobody thinks command is easy
Buckland says I never expected it to be easy
As Bush walks away he whispers to himself I expected to be fit for it
Horatio is aboard one of the Spanish ships en route to Jamaica
Matthews is with him
They are having one of their frank conversations
Matthews tells Horatio After what happened today I d say Buckland is a man of no conscience
Horatio tells him that it is difficult commanding a large vessel and being responsible for so many men
They mention Captain Sawyer Back on the Renown Sawyer is acting crazy crawling on the floor
Buckland tells the guard to release him from the straight jacket
Buckland tries to tell Sawyer that he never wanted any of this
Hobbs tries to help Sawyer
Buckland pours himself a drink In the brig on the Renown the former Spanish Commander s wife is flirting with her guard
It s obvious that something is going on Hobbs takes Sawyer to the hole where he d fallen earlier
He asks him what he sees he s trying to help Sawyer remember what happened
Wellard tells Hobbs to leave him alone
Hobbs tells him to leave Sawyer alone
Sawyer says it wasn t him Wellard who pushed the captain
Sawyer is confused and mistakes Wellard for an Admiral he used to know
Hobbs informs Wellard that eventually Sawyer will remember what happened to him
Hobbs takes Sawyer back to his cabin and puts him to bed
He s still acting crazy The commander s wife is still flirting with her guard
He unlocks her cell and she gets out
They find a quiet place and he starts to kiss her
She removes a knife from her garter and sticks it into his back
She takes his keys and releases the other wives from the cell
Then she releases the men who attack the marines standing watch
They take guns from the ship s armory and try a sneak attack on Bush but he must have heard them coming because he is ready for them and shoots them with his pistol
Bush Archie and their men including Styles are under full attack on the Renown from the Spanish On a Spanish vessel Horatio is roused from his bunk by Matthews who shows him that the Renown is under siege
He orders all hands on deck
They come alongside the Renown and assist the others in fighting off the Spanish Wellard sneaks into Sawyer s cabin with a pistol in his hand
He says he can t allow Sawyer to get to Jamaica he will not allow Sawyer to remember who pushed him
Sawyer taunts Wellard and belittles him taking the pistol from him
Then the fighting is heard outside Sawyer s cabin door
Sawyer tells Wellard he remembers who pushed him
Then he hands the pistol back to Wellard
They stand side by side to face the enemy
The door bursts open and they are both shot
Sawyer dies instantly
Hobbs enters the cabin Horatio and the others have retaken control of the ships and the Spanish surrender again
Bush is badly wounded
Styles calls Horatio over to Bush Dr Clive begins to work on him Wellard tells Hobbs how Sawyer told Wellard he was brave
He also tells Hobbs he knew who pushed him
Hobbs puts his ear to Wellard s mouth then Wellard dies
Horatio comes in at that moment and tells Hobbs that Sawyer died a hero in battle and that he was a leader of men Styles and Horatio find Buckland tied up in his cabin
They release him Horatio informs him that the Renown and other ships have been recovered
Buckland says that he can see that they are recovered and he can see WHO recovered them
Horatio leaves Buckland and returns to the deck
He and Archie have a little chuckle about poor Buckland
Horatio notices that Archie is bleeding
He opens Archie s jacket to find his shirt covered in blood from a chest wound
Blood spews from Archie s mouth In Jamaica Archie lies in a sickbed in a cell recovering from his wounds while Horatio is escorted to the court martial proceedings
Bush lies recovering in a bed next to Archie
Outside the tribunal workers are building a gallows Pellew questions Buckland about his command
He is criticized for losing control of the Renown to the Spanish prisoners
One of the tribunes makes a joke saying Buckland s epitaph will say he was caught napping
The courthouse erupts into laughter
Pellew does not find it at all amusing
Neither does Capt
Hammond
Pellew begins to say that thankfully there was at least one officer present who He is interrupted by Buckland who cries that the reason the proceedings are taking place is all is because Captain Sawyer was unfit for command
He endangered the lives of every man on the ship
Pellew stops him and warns him not to blacken the name of one of Nelson s own
Buckland interrupts again insisting that Sawyer was unfit for command for ONE REASON He didn t fall into that hold he was pushed by Lt Horatio Hornblower
Buckland implies that Gunner Hobbs will support his claims Later out in the street Styles spits into Hobbs face and calls him a traitor Dr
Clive examines Bush
He has a deep sabre gash in his chest
Clive tells him he ll mend
Archie coughs horribly Hobbs is on the witness stand
Hammond confirms that he is there to corroborate Buckland s story
Hobbs speaks of his loyalty to Sawyer
Hammond asks Hobbs who pushed Sawyer into the hold
Hobbs says My captain was a leader of men and he died in battle
But I m afraid I cannot tell you who pushed him
A murmur goes through the room as people are surprised Hobbs does not implicate Hornblower The three members of the tribunal meet privately behind closed doors
Pellew makes a plea to put an end to the proceedings in order to save the life of a man willing to abandon his own life for others a man for whom others would gladly give their own lives
We should not try to hang this man we should promote him
Hammond responds that he would like them to put the question to Horatio and ask him if he pushed Sawyer down the hold
As a man of honor he will answer it Dr
Clive examines Archie
Horatio enters
Dr Clive offers him his hand they shake hands
Archie asks Horatio what he will say at the hearing when they ask him if he pushed Sawyer
Horatio tells them he will not give that answer until they ask it The next morning Horatio stops to see Archie before going to the tribunal
He is not in his bed
He asks Bush where Archie is but Bush tells him he s about somewhere Archie is shown entering the tribunal with the assistance of Dr Clive
He testifies that he and he alone pushed Sawyer into the hold Back at the cell Horatio suddenly realizes what Archie is doing
Bush tells him it must be done
Archie is removed from the room just as Horatio arrives
Horatio is devastated Later Buckland is shown sitting at a table pouring himself a glass a wine
The glass overflows and wine spills onto the table but Buckland doesn t seem to notice he just keeps pouring the wine
Someone knocks on his door and calls to him but he doesn t respond
He is obviously very troubled by what is taking place Back in Archie s cell Dr Clive checks on his patient
Bush has apparently been released
Horatio asks Archie why
He is choking back tears
Archie explains that he is very ill and doesn t think he ll live long enough to face the gallows
He tells Horatio he is frightened but Horatio tells him he is the bravest man Horatio knows
Horatio feels badly about the sacrifice Archie makes to save him Archie Poor Horatio
So quick to give so slow to accept the simplest gift
You have done the same for me you know a thousand times
Horatio But never at such a dear cost
Archie Please take what I offer
Take it and say goodbye
Horatio Archie
He s really choking back the tears now
I am honored to have served with you
Archie smiling and choking back tears at the same time And I to have known you
Horatio Bye
Archie smiling You see
Better already
Archie gasps moans and then dies Horatio whispers My dear friend
He is heartbroken
He remains sitting by Archie s bed
The image fades away and then comes back again
The bed is now empty but Horatio is still sitting there Commodore Pellew enters the cell
He gives Horatio a newspaper
A story describes how Sawyer was a hero
There is no mention of Archie
Pellew says Archie was a man of great loyalty who saw his duty and did it
Horatio says he went to his grave without the merit of his good name
Pellew says that he and Horatio will not forget what Archie did
Pellew tells Horatio that one of the Spanish ships captured by the Renown is being renamed the Retribution
He hands Horatio orders that say The Captain of the Retribution Commander Horatio HornblowerHoratio thinks that Bush who was second in command should have received the honor
But Pellew tells him he d better accept a promotion when it is offered Pellew I wish you a safe voyage Mr
Hornblower
He and Horatio exchange a very meaningful look like a father and a son would at a very important moment
Horatio thanks him

Carson gravely intones that the entity they seek is an aberration of the species
Something hallucinating evil and warns the Parkers that it would be best if they didn t find him
Meanwhile for reasons left unclear the maniac decides to fixate on a young American pre school teacher named Mary Jones who shares a two story bungalow in Johannesburg s Saxonwold neighborhood with her 18 year old Afrikaner cousin Jo
Mary first sees the elusive maniac lurking outside her classroom disappearing and re appearing in the fog and later spying on her at the mall
When not stalking Mary the maniac holes up in his hotel room doing push ups growling and tearing up girly magazines
He also prowls Johannesburg s Hillbrow district at night attacking various women
Soon Jo finds herself embroiled in a hot and heavy affair with rich American playboy Dean Turner much to Mary s chagrin
While Jo is being wined and dined Mary first finds herself threatened by heavy breathing phone calls and then by menacing knocks at the door
Even her neighbor Dr Stuart turns up with his trusty 38 Special to have a face down with the attacker but by then he s vanished
Mary tries to confide in Jo that she feels terrorized but Jo distracted by her budding relationship with Dean dismisses it as Mary s being all alone in this big house
Col Carson continues to assist the Parkers in their search for Emily and the maniac
Carson produces some crude sketches of the maniac and is able to locate the maniac s hideout
However Carson warns Mr Parker that if he attempts to take justice into his own hands it ll end badly

Meanwhile back at Mary s house the Demon kills Jo and Dean and then hides in the house waiting for Mary to come home
Mary returns to find the place trashed and Jo murdered
She runs screaming through the house until she comes face to face with The Demon who has locked all the doors
She freaks out and a Cat and mouse stalking sequence ensues as the Demon pursues Mary up and down stairs inside closets and up to the attic where she attempts escape through a hole in the roof
When that proves futile she locks herself in a bathroom and devises a booby trap to ultimately catch and kill the Demon using a shower nozzle a bottle of shampoo and a pair of scissors
When the Demon bursts through the door he s hit in the face with a blast of hot water
Mary stabs him in the neck with scissors and he slips on the shampoo and falls into the bathtub bleeding to death

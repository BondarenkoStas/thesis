Koreeda s After Life is set in a small mid 20th century social service style office acting as a waystation where the souls of the recently deceased are processed before entering heaven
Heaven for the film is a single happy memory from one s life re experienced for eternity which each of the deceased must choose within their seven days at the waystation Every Monday a new group of recently deceased people check in and the social workers in the lodge explain to each guest their situation
The newly dead have until Wednesday to identify the single happiest memory
For the rest of the week the workers at the institution work to design and replicate each person s chosen memory thereby replicating the single happiest moment of that person s life
This moment is staged and filmed
At the end of the week the recently deceased watch the films of their recreated happiest memories in a screening room
As soon as each person sees his or her own memory he or she vanishes to whatever unknown state of existence lies beyond and takes only that single memory with them
The story pays most attention to two of the counselors Takashi and Shiori
Takashi has been assigned to help an old man Ichiro select his memory
Takashi reviews videotape of Ichiro s life and learns that Ichiro had married Takashi s former fianc√©e after Takashi had been killed during World War II
Takashi has Ichiro assigned to another counselor but is still troubled by his memories causing both him and his quasi romantic interest Shiori to re examine their lives

Jerry receives a telegram from his Uncle Pecos saying he is on his way to the big city from Texas for a guitar solo and will be staying with his nephew for the night Pecos then arrives shortly after
The mustached mouse gives Jerry a performance on his guitar playing his new song Crambone which he gets through most of until he breaks a guitar string toward the end
Uncle Pecos asks Jerry if he has a spare guitar string but Jerry shakes his head in the way of saying no
Pecos looks out the mouse hole and claims he sees another string
He walks up to a sleeping Tom and fearlessly plucks a whisker off the cat s face and installs it into his guitar startling Tom awake
As Pecos starts to play a song a shocked Jerry comes to the rescue and quickly carries his reckless uncle away from Tom back to the mouse hole accidentally banging his uncle s head on the wall just above the hole whilst doing so
Just as Tom is about to get them Jerry drags Pecos into the hole but Pecos quickly sticks his head out and thanks a confused Tom for his service
Tom then heads to the bathroom to examine his severed whisker in the mirror but then he hears the sound of Pecos breaking another string
Pecos then appears and plucks another whisker from Tom s face
An angry Tom seizes Pecos but Jerry arrives rescuing his uncle again by squirting a tube of toothpaste into Tom s face with the toothpaste forming into a pair of glasses
As Jerry makes a run back to the mouse hole with Pecos they fall through a floor grate
Tom arrives and listens to Pecos continuing to play his guitar until he breaks another string and claims he needs another whisker
Scared of feeling any more pain due to another whisker being plucked Tom barricades the grate and flees
He hides next to the basement door which Pecos throws open on top of him and calls for the cat while Jerry holds onto his uncle s tail trying to restrain him
The force of the impact causes the basement door to break into pieces revealing a flattened Tom who immediately runs away as Pecos follows
Tom slams anything he can find onto Pecos in order to keep him at bay first a bread bin then the top half of a Dutch Door shut and finally a mop
As if uninterrupted Pecos keeps coming and tries to reason with the cat that he needs a whisker to fix his guitar and is not going to let a broken string stand in the way of his fame and fortune
As a last resort Tom jumps out the kitchen window and runs back to the front door before shutting it
He slowly checks through the peep hole to see if the coast is clear but Pecos suddenly reaches through and yanks off a whisker
Pecos installs the whisker which immediately snaps after he tunes his guitar
Tom frantically runs away to look for another place to hide
Pecos comes searching for him again and finds him sitting on a chair wearing a knight s helmet and holding a book and a lit cigar
Tom dumps some cigar ash onto Pecos s head but an unfazed Pecos responds by flipping the chair over and removing another whisker
Adamant not to lose the two leftover whiskers Tom dashes into a nearby closet and slams the door shut
Pecos then invites Jerry to listen to the song he s going to play for his encore which he plays at first with no problems
This causes Tom to calm down a little and he steps out of his hiding place
But just as he is liking the music that Pecos is generating the snap of yet another string is heard causing Tom to instantaneously gasp and retreat back into the closet
Determined to get another whisker Pecos approaches the closet door declaring You know darn well I can t leave without a guitar string
before he proceeds to attack the door with an ax
Tom finally surrenders with a white flag pulls out his fifth whisker and hands it to Pecos
Later Pecos announces to Jerry that he has to leave and reminds him to watch his concert the next night
The night comes and both Jerry and Tom are watching his performance on the living room TV
Pecos starts playing but midway through one of the guitar s strings snaps again
Tom goes up to the TV and laughs hysterically at Peco s situation knowing that he has no replacement strings
But in a comical twist Pecos reaches through the TV screen and yanks out Tom s last whisker leaving the feline baffled as Pecos finishes his performance

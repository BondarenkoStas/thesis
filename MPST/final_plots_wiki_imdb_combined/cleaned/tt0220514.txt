Society as we know it may have been lost but sex and dancing are still in style in this outrageous post apocalyptic satire
In a not so distant future where a variety of environmental disasters have led to the final collapse of Western civilization sexually ambiguous hipster Ricky G leads an encampment of rave kids who have created a makeshift city on the outskirts of Winnipeg
One of the community s leading citizens is porn merchant and disc jockey Sabu whose inexhaustible sexual appetite has led him on a mission to seduce 2 000 men before a looming flood destroys the village
Sabu is close enough to hitting the magic number to have chosen the special man he wants to be Mister 2K Happy an attractive if socially inept science buff who is able to communicate with alien life forms
However Sabu has a rival for Happy s affections body modification advocate and hair stylist Spanky who tries to foil Sabu s plans by abducting Happy
Hey Happy
was the first dramatic feature from Canadian independent filmmaker Noam Gonick
Mark Deming RoviThe film s action takes place on the desolate outskirts of Winnipeg on the eve of what could well be the Apocalypse
Pot smoking amyl nitrate sniffing DJ Sabu works at an open air porn emporium mixing beats and the moans and groans of smut movie soundtracks with random radio transmissions warning of the second coming of the Great Flood
Apocalypse or no apocalypse DJ Sabu is on a personal mission He s determined to sleep with 2 000 guys and he s just one fling away from reaching his goal
That fling Sabu has decided will be Happy Winnipeg s version of the village idiot who finds numerological patterns in men s room graffiti and receives communiques from other astral planes
Or maybe it s just the side effects of the toxic waste Happy slurps and sniffs
Sabu propositions Happy at that night s rave on Garbage Hill and Happy once he overcomes his virginal shyness is eager to oblige the alien voices tell him they can t make physical contact until he has sex with Sabu
So the stage is set for something like romance until Sabu s nemesis the evil genius hairdresser Spanky O Niel and his goon squad of chubby beauticians nab Happy and force him into love slavery
This ready made midnight movie probably won t stand the cold light of day but under the right conditions it s goofy fun
It s the kind of shock flick that revels in its own offensiveness and even goes so far as to reenact one of the more disgusting moments from John Water s seminal PINK FLAMINGOS
Gonick transfigures Winnipeg into an industrial junkyard filled with colorful freaks and transsexual disco superstars a place where everyone seems to be at least one of several shades of gay
Clearly it s not for everyone
Extra points for a great electronic soundtrack striking widescreen cinematography and an unapologetically freaky attitude

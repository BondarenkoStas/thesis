Romero Rômulo is a hero of the people
For others he is just a selfish crook
He heads an institution that bestows former convicts into society
Little does anyone know that it is also a way of recruiting criminals for the clique he belongs to and through which he earns good money through several robberies and scams
His lover Atena is a swindler who misses no chances
Unprincipled and immoral she only wants to take advantage of Romero
But deep down she hides true feelings for him
One of Romero s mortal enemies is his stepfather Zé Maria whom he accused in the past of killing twenty people during a massacre inside a bus
Djanira has never forgiven her son Romero for the testimony because the love of her life had to become a fugitive from justice
Besides she had to raise her stepson the former wrestler Juliano and her adopted daughter the virtuous Toia by herself
They grew up together and soon started dating but Juliano s desire for revenge keeps getting in the way of the couple s romance
Juliano is released on probation for suspected drug trafficking whereas he also seeks for justice and intends to prove his father s innocence pointing all the blame to the dangerous syndicate

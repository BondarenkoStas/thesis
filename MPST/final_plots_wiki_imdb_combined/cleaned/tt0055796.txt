The plot follows Billy Budd a seaman impressed into service aboard HMS Bellipotent in the year 1797 when the British Royal Navy was reeling from two major mutinies and was threatened by the Revolutionary French Republic s military ambitions
He is impressed to this large warship from another smaller merchant ship The Rights of Man
As his former ship moves off Budd shouts Good bye to you too old Rights of Man
Billy a foundling from Bristol has an innocence good looks and a natural charisma that make him popular with the crew
His only physical defect is a stutter which grows worse when under intense emotion
He arouses the antagonism of the ship s master at arms John Claggart
Claggart while not unattractive seems somehow defective or abnormal in the constitution possessing a natural depravity
Envy is Claggart s explicitly stated emotion toward Budd foremost because of his significant personal beauty and also for his innocence and general popularity
This leads Claggart to falsely charge Billy with conspiracy to mutiny
When the captain Edward Fairfax Starry Vere is presented with Claggart s charges he summons Claggart and Billy to his cabin for a private meeting
Claggart makes his case and Billy astounded is unable to respond due to his stutter
He strikes his accuser to the forehead and the blow is fatal
Vere convenes a drumhead court martial
He acts as convening authority prosecutor defense counsel and sole witness
He intervenes in the deliberations of the court martial panel to persuade them to convict Billy despite their and his beliefs in Billy s moral innocence
Vere claims to be following the letter of the Mutiny Act and the Articles of War
Although Vere and the other officers do not believe Claggart s charge of conspiracy and think Billy justified in his response they find that their own opinions matter little
The martial law in effect states that during wartime the blow itself fatal or not is a capital crime
The court martial convicts Billy following Vere s argument that any appearance of weakness in the officers and failure to enforce discipline could stir more mutiny throughout the British fleet
Condemned to be hanged the morning after his attack on Claggart Billy before his execution says God bless Captain Vere
His words were repeated by the gathered crew in a resonant and sympathetic echo
CH 26 The novel closes with three chapters that present ambiguity Chapter 28 describes the death of Captain Vere
In a naval action against the French ship Ath√©e Captain Vere is mortally wounded
His last words are Billy Budd Billy Budd
Chapter 29 presents an extract from an official naval gazette purporting to give the facts of the fates of John Claggart and Billy Budd aboard HMS Bellipotent but the facts offered turn the facts that the reader learned from the story upside down
The gazette article described Budd as a conspiring mutineer likely of foreign birth and mysterious antecedents who is confronted by John Claggart
The master at arms loyally enforcing the law is fatally stabbed by Budd
The gazette concludes that the crime and weapon used suggest a foreign birth and subversive character it reports that the mutineer was executed and nothing is amiss aboard HMS Bellipotent
Chapter 30 reprints a cheaply printed ballad written by one of Billy s shipmates as an elegy
The adult experienced man represented in the poem is not the innocent youth portrayed in the preceding chapters

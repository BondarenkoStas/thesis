The serial opens in the 1940s during World War II in the fictional Indian city of Mayapore against the backdrop of the last years of the British Raj and the Indian independence movement
Hari Kumar is a young Indian man who was educated at Chillingborough a British public school he identifies as English rather than Indian
The bankruptcy of his father a formerly successful businessman forces him to return to India to live with his aunt
Working as a journalist Kumar sees that his position is lower in India where he is discriminated against by many British colonists and held in some suspicion by Indian independence activists
He becomes involved with a British woman Daphne Manners who does not share the prejudices of most of her people
One night after Hari and Daphne make love in the public Bibighar Gardens at the same time that violent anti British demonstrations are taking place elsewhere in the city the couple are attacked by a group of unknown Indian men
Hari is beaten and Daphne is raped showing that not only the British opposed relationships across ethnic boundaries
The local Indian Police superintendent is Ronald Merrick a young Englishman who is intelligent hardworking and from a lower class background
He had made advances to Daphne during her first months in India and been politely but firmly rebuffed
He arrests Hari for her rape holding him in the local jail where he beats and sexually humiliates him
Merrick resents Hari s privileged education and he resents Daphne s preferring the young Indian to him
Because Daphne refuses to cooperate with the investigation the police do not prosecute Hari for rape but Merrick arrests Kumar and a group of young educated Indians sending them to prison for detention without trial under the security regulations adopted to deal with suppressing the Indian independence movement
Word that Hari was tortured causes outrage in the Indian community
Merrick is transferred from Mayapore to a smaller and less important town in the province
Daphne learns she is pregnant
She chooses to believe the father is Hari though she cannot know whether it is he or one of the rapists who is the father
She dies in childbirth
The mixed race child a girl is taken in by Daphne s aunt Lady Manners widow of a former provincial governor
While Lady Manners takes the infant to the resort area of Srinagar she meets Sarah Layton a young British woman on vacation with her mother and her sister Susan
Sarah and Susan s father is the colonel of the Indian Army regiment in Pankot a hill station near Mayapore
He is being held as a prisoner of war in Germany where his unit was captured

Merrick seeing a relationship with the upper class Teddie and the Laytons as a means to career advancement is pleased to help
While Merrick and Teddie are driving to the ceremony a stone is thrown at their car slightly injuring Teddie
Merrick understands that he was the target of the attack as this is one of a series of incidents suggesting he is being harassed because of his treatment of Kumar and the other suspects in the Manners case in Mayapore
Soon after the wedding Teddie and Merrick leave for the Burma front with their unit
Teddie is soon killed in an ambush by soldiers of the Japanese sponsored Indian National Army
Merrick is badly wounded trying to get Teddie to safety and is evacuated to a hospital in Calcutta
When Sarah visits him to thank him she learns that his arm is to be amputated and that his face will be permanently disfigured by burn scars
Merrick reveals to Sarah that Teddie was ambushed because of him
Teddie had left their unit to try to persuade two Indian soldiers of his regiment who had been captured by the Japanese and joined the INA to surrender and come in
Merrick believes Teddie took this risk to prove to him that the Indian soldiers even after becoming turncoats would resume their loyalty to the British if given the chance
Faced with losing his arm and being left permanently disfigured Merrick s hostility against Indians has increased
Lady Manners presses to gain a formal inquiry into the arrest and detention of Hari Kumar
It is conducted by Nigel Rowan an aide to the governor of the province

After his convalescence Merrick is promoted and assigned to intelligence activities concerning the INA and Indian soldiers who collaborated with the enemy
He comes across the Laytons again in Bombay where Sarah is reunited with her father Colonel Layton just released from a German POW camp following Germany s surrender
Merrick is there to interrogate an Indian soldier who had served under Colonel Layton and assisted the Germans after Layton s unit was captured and who has been deported to India
Merrick gains assistance from Sergeant Guy Perron a young Cambridge graduate and Indian history scholar who was serving with an Intelligence Corps Field Security unit he speaks fluent Urdu and is asked to observe the interrogation
Merrick learns that Perron also attended Chillingborough and happened to know Hari Kumar when they were students
After the interrogation Perron runs into Merrick and Sarah Layton by chance at a party
He accompanies them to the apartment of Layton s aunt where Sarah and her father are staying temporarily
Sarah and Perron are attracted to each other
Merrick decides to have Perron assigned to assist him in further investigations of Indian soldiers who became collaborators
Perron and Sarah both find Merrick distasteful but Perron has no choice but to work with him
After the death of her husband Teddie and the difficult birth of their son the young widow Susan Layton Bingham suffers a mental breakdown and is treated in a hospital in Pankot
When Merrick returns to the Pankot area while working on his inquiry into collaborators he starts to court Susan and ultimately marries her
Perron later learns that Merrick blackmailed a young British hospital clerk into giving him access to Susan s medical records apparently to learn about her mental state and use this material to persuade her to marry him
Her sister Sarah dislikes Merrick and is opposed to the marriage but she is unable to stop it
With the surrender of Japan in August 1945 the war in the East is ended and the days of British rule in India are clearly numbered

The situation in Mirat is tense due to conflict between Hindus and Muslims related to independence
Bronowsky tells Perron the real story behind Merrick s death
He relates that Merrick died in the course of a sexual rendezvous with a young Indian man who was probably employed by independent activists and who was believed to have let in an assassin who killed Merrick
The authorities cover up the details of Merrick s death fearing reprisals from the Indians in this time of political uncertainty regarding British departure
The two discuss their view that in leaving India the British are opening up Pandora s Box releasing the ancient competition for power between the Hindus and Muslims who had earlier conquered and ruled the country
Some confrontations had been restrained by the power of the British as rulers
Sarah Susan and their aunt attend Merrick s funeral in Mirat
Perron decides to accompany them on the train back to Pankot
Joining them is Ahmed Kasim the educated son of a prominent Muslim politician who has been working for Bronowsky in Mirat for the past few years
En route to Pankot the train is stopped by a gang of Hindus who attack Muslim passengers in retaliation for recent attacks on Hindus in Mirat
The attackers demand that Kasim be turned over to them
Before his fellow passengers can react Kasim voluntarily leaves the train car and surrenders himself to the attackers who murder him
Perron Sarah and the other English passengers are unharmed but are horrified by the slaughter of Kasim and other passengers
Before leaving India again Perron visits Hari Kumar now living in a poor neighborhood and supporting himself by tutoring Indian students in English
He leaves his card as Kumar is out
Perron reflects on how Kumar was caught in an impossible position between England and India

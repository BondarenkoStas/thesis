As the story begins Susan learns about a series of murders that has occurred in the London area and begins to recognize patterns connecting the killings

As they all signed orders of secrecy about their work during the war the two married women disguise their activities from their husbands as a book club
Failing to secure police involvement they move from codebreaking and investigation into the realm of field work with dangerous consequences on several occasions

The series contrasts the conventional but very different lives of the four women and the sense of usefulness they felt while codebreaking during the war

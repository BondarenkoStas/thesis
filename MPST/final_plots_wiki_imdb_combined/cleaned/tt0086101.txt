Prologue On the stage of the fictional Opéra Populaire in 1905 an auction of old theatrical props is underway
Lot 665 purchased by the elderly Raoul Vicomte de Chagny is a papier mâché music box in the shape of a barrel organ attached to the figure of a monkey in Persian robes playing the cymbals
He eyes it sadly noting that its details appear exactly as she said
Lot 666 is a shattered chandelier that the auctioneer explains has a connection to the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera a mystery never fully explained
As the chandelier is uncovered its lamps flicker to life and it magically rises over the audience to its original position in the rafters
As it ascends the years roll back and the Opéra returns to its 1880s grandeur
Act I It is now 1881
As Carlotta the Opéra s resident soprano prima donna rehearses for the evening s performance a backdrop collapses without warning
The Phantom
He s here
whisper anxious cast members
The Opera s new owners Firmin and André try to downplay the incident but Carlotta refuses to continue and storms offstage
Madame Giry the Opéra s ballet mistress tells Firmin and André that Christine Daaé a Swedish chorus girl and orphaned daughter of a prominent violinist has been well taught and could sing Carlotta s role
With cancellation of the performance their only alternative the owners reluctantly audition Christine and to their surprise she is equal to the challenge
Backstage after her triumphant début Christine confesses to her best friend Meg that she knows her mysterious teacher only as an invisible Angel of Music
The Opera s new patron Raoul the Vicomte de Chagny finds Christine his old childhood playmate in her dressing room
Christine reminisces with Raoul about the Angel of Music stories that her late father used to tell them and confides that the Angel has visited her and taught her to sing
Raoul laughs at her fantasies and invites her to dinner
He exits and a jealous Phantom appears in Christine s mirror in the guise of The Angel of Music
Christine begs him to reveal himself and The Phantom obliges pulling her through the mirror and into his underground realm
They cross a subterranean lake to his secret lair beneath the opéra house
The Phantom explains that he has chosen Christine to sing his music and enchants her with his own sublime voice
Christine sees a mannequin resembling herself in a wedding dress and when the mannequin suddenly moves she faints
The Phantom picks her up and places her gently on a bed
As the Phantom composes music at his organ Christine awakens to the sound of the monkey music box
She slips behind the Phantom lifts his mask and beholds his real face
The Phantom rails at her curiosity then ruefully expresses his longing to look normal and to be loved by her
Meanwhile Joseph Buquet the Opéra s chief stagehand who like Madame Giry inexplicably knows much about the Phantom regales everyone with tales of the Opéra Ghost and his terrible Punjab lasso
Madame Giry warns Buquet to exercise restraint
In the managers office Madame Giry delivers a note from the Phantom He demands that Christine replace Carlotta in the new opera Il Muto or there will be a terrible disaster beyond imagination
Firmin and André assure an enraged Carlotta that she will remain the star but during her performance the Phantom reduces her voice to a frog like croak forcing her to withdraw
A ballet interlude ensues to keep the audience entertained as Christine prepares to replace Carlotta
Suddenly the corpse of Buquet hanging from the Punjab lasso drops from the rafters
Firmin and André plead for calm as the Phantom s diabolical laughter is heard
In the ensuing mêlée Christine escapes with Raoul to the roof where she tells him about her subterranean rendezvous with the Phantom
Raoul is sceptical but swears to love and to protect her always and Christine reciprocates his love
The Phantom who has overheard their entire conversation is heartbroken
He angrily vows revenge against Raoul and in a fit of rage sends the Opéra s mighty chandelier crashing to the stage as the curtain falls
Act II Six months later in the midst of the gala masquerade ball the Phantom costumed as the Red Death makes his first appearance since the chandelier disaster
He announces to the stunned guests that he has written an opera entitled Don Juan Triumphant
He demands that it be produced immediately with Christine in the lead role and warns of dire consequences if it is not
He seizes Christine s engagement ring and vanishes in a flash of fire and smoke
Raoul demands that Madame Giry tell him about the Phantom
She reluctantly replies that he is a brilliant musician and magician born with a terrifyingly deformed face who escaped from captivity in a travelling freak show and disappeared
During rehearsals Raoul hatches a plan to use Don Juan Triumphant as a trap to capture the Phantom knowing the Phantom will be sure to attend its première
Christine torn between her love for Raoul and her gratitude for the Phantom s teaching visits her father s grave longing for his guidance
The Phantom appears again under the guise of the Angel of Music
Christine nearly falls under his spell but Raoul arrives to rescue her
The Phantom taunts Raoul launching fiery missiles at him until Christine begs Raoul to leave with her
Furious the Phantom sets fire to the cemetery
Don Juan Triumphant opens with Christine and Ubaldo Piangi the Opéra s principal tenor singing the lead roles
During their duet Christine realises that she is singing not with Piangi but with the Phantom himself
When he expresses his love for her and gives her his ring Christine rips off his mask exposing his deformed face to the shocked audience
As Piangi is found strangled to death backstage the Phantom seizes Christine and flees the theatre
An angry mob led by Meg searches the theatre for the Phantom while Madame Giry directs Raoul to the Phantom s subterranean lair and warns him to beware his Punjab lasso
When Raoul arrives at the lair Christine is wearing the mannequin s wedding dress
The Phantom ambushes Raoul and binds him with his lasso
He tells Christine that he will free Raoul if she agrees to stay with him forever if she refuses Raoul will die
Christine responds that it is the Phantom s soul that people fear not his face and kisses him
The Phantom at last understands that he cannot compel Christine to love him and releases them both
Christine returns the Phantom s ring bids him farewell and exits with Raoul
The Phantom weeping huddles on his throne and covers himself with his cape
The mob storms the lair and Meg pulls away the cape but the Phantom has vanished only his mask remains

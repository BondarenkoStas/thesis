In the Old West town of Dry Gulp Jerry wanted for cheese rustlin steals a piece of cheese at the general store
When the shopkeeper angrily demands action the sheriff hires the fastest trap in the West to Jerry s horror a dramatic scene shown before the start
This turns out to be Tom who comes to town riding spurs like skates
He crashes into the sheriff s office and gives him a card saying Have Trap will Travel
He then gives a poor demonstration of how he is quick on the draw with mousetraps
Tom and Jerry gather for a confrontation of drawing their weapons but when Tom draws his weapons he accidentally breaks his belt and the bottom half of his fur falls down revealing his boxers
Tom hops away while Jerry breaks into a fit of laughter
Once Tom has recovered he gives chase until they reach Jerry s hideout
Jerry rushes inside but Tom puts his hand through the door trying to grab him
Jerry then puts a large bag of flour in Tom s hand to fool him into thinking it s him
As Tom tries to yank it out Jerry opens another door above Tom s head and hits him with a mallet
An angry Tom then chases Jerry to Rocky s Saloon where he gets his head caught in the clapping doors before finding him in the basement
Tom is now armed with a rifle and as he prepares to take aim Jerry tricks Tom into a game of turning the light on and off until Tom finally falls down to the bottom of the stairs when the light is left off
After it comes back on Tom s rifle is aimed at him by Jerry who then shoots him
The chase continues with Jerry running into another hole
Tom draws one of his traps and lines it with cheese hoping to catch Jerry but the mouse opens a door behind Tom pulling his tail into the trap
When the trap snaps Tom realizes too late that his own tail is in it and leaps into the air with a scream
Finally Tom brings a powder keg from the general store hoping to get rid of Jerry once and for all
Jerry drills a hole in the bottom of the keg and the gunpowder trickles out before Tom lights the fuse at the top
Seeing this Tom pushes the barrel into a water hole near the sheriff s office
But the fuse at the top is still burning and the keg explodes destroying the Sheriff s office
The Sheriff angrily aims his six shooter at Tom and chases him out of town while Jerry steals the last piece of cheese from the general store

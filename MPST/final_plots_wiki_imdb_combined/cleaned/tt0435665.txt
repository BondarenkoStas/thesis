A few months after the events of the first film Professor Roy Curien at the fictional Cuesta Verde University has managed to subdue and contain a Hyper sapiens specimen who is revealed to be his son Rudy Curien
Curien experiments on another survivor trying to determine the source of her immortality with apparent disregard for the rotted state of Alicia s body
When Curien has created a serum that he believes will bring back the dead and grant immortality Curien murders one of his students and injects her with the serum
She returns to life infects Curien and breaks out of the building
A month later the university has a full fledged outbreak which is confirmed by AMC reconnaissance teams
Jake Ellis an agent for AMS goes in search of fellow agent Alexandra Nightingale Morgan
He finds her on a date at a restaurant where she must execute several infected people before she returns to base with Ellis
They are ordered to retrieve a blood sample from the originally infected specimen on campus missiles will level the campus at midnight regardless of whether the agents are still present or not
She assigns a gender mixed Special Forces team of U S Marines to provide them with backup
Ellis openly questions the competence of the soldiers leading to friction between the two units
Upon arrival at CVU the soldiers encounter zombies
One soldier panics and another becomes infected after his gun jams
When the others discover his injury they sever his infect arm but he turns and infects the team medic both are executed by Ellis
The team continues forward into the university proper
They proceed to battle through the hordes of infected splitting into two teams
Two female soldiers Lieutenant Alison Henson and Private Maria Rodriguez and a male soldier Bart investigate the dorms
They break into a female dormitory where they find the deceased naked body of a zombie
Bart attempts to pose with the corpse and is bitten by a mosquito trapped in the room
Fearing contamination but unwilling to execute Bart who is threatening them with a handgun Henson handcuffs Bart to a radiator and the two soldiers exit the room falling back to the van
Meanwhile the second team including Ellis and Nightingale are attacked multiple times
Eventually every soldier escorting them is killed including the leader of the unit Sergeant Griffin
They fight their way to the professor s laboratory and find the original specimen still imprisoned as well as a pair of students who had survived
They enter the confinement room and extract blood from the zombie but are forced to kill it when it breaks free
The two students Lonny and Sarah who had allowed them into the confinement room are overrun and torn apart by zombies and Ellis and Nightingale escape while the zombies are feeding on the bodies
Henson and Rodriguez make it to the extraction vehicle
There they prepare to rescue Nightingale and Ellis but Rodriguez is bitten by a zombie who was locked in the back of the van by the soldier assigned to guard it

Ellis and Nightingale saved by Henson but the blood sample vial is destroyed in the process
They are forced to turn back with ten minutes before the military releases the missile level the campus and fight their way back to the confinement room
They retrieve a second vial but Henson is bitten on the ankle
She remains behind and commits suicide as Nightingale and Ellis escape before the missile strikes the campus and only Ellis made it out but Nightingale trapped surrounded by zombies
Bart breaks free from the dormitory by amputating his hand and forces Ellis to hand over the vial

Following the events of the first game Tak has now been stuck in a dream for 16 days
Jibolba and Lok ponder how they can wake him up
In reality Tak is stuck in the Dream World and is sent by the Dream Juju to fight the Dream Guardian take The Staff of Dreams and save the princess
After Tak refuses he is told that if he does not do this he will be stuck in the dream forever
As he fights through the Dream World he escapes through a Rift
When going through the rift Tak wakes up and Jibolba and Tak go find Jibolba s brother JB
Lok wants to go but Jibolba tells Lok to go fetch his magic sandals
Jibolba turns into a Flea for easy hauling and they set off
When Tak and Jibolba reach a dead end they summon the Belly Juju to get a raft
Belly Juju uses a barrel that Tak got for him and throws Tak in it and throws the barrel down river
Lok is once again left behind and when Belly Juju chokes Lok has to save him
As Tak and Jibolba go down the fast current they fall down a huge waterfall and Tak is knocked out
He wakes up in the Dream World once again being led by the Dream Juju
Once he makes it to the end he again enters the real world through a rift
Once in the real world Tak and Jibolba set off again
When they reach a bridge they have to wait for Woodies to pass but when they do Lok blows up the bridge and the Woodies attack
When Tak saves Lok he summons Mind Reader Juju
He tells Tak that with three magic stones he can make Bolas to get across the gap
When Tak does this he is knocked out by Woodies again entering the Dream World
Tak then uses the Bolas to get through the Dream World
For the third time he gets back to his world using a rift
When he awakes he is in the holding area in the Gloomleaf Arena where Woodies train with Caged Juju
After an argument Caged Juju finds Lok and uses a lift key to get up
When up Lok is hauled off by Woodies and Tak fights through waves of Woodies
After four rounds he uses a Woodie Catapult to escape flying into the Gloomleaf Swamp
When half way through the swamp he sees Dead Juju being harassed by Woodies who steal his Tiki
Tak follows the Woodies to the rafters of the Arena where Tak steals the Tiki from the Woodie King
He is then chased down river by Woodies and when he falls down a waterfall he grabs to a ledge with Dead Juju
When he returns the Tiki Lok suddenly falls down the waterfall and the four head off together
When outside Skyrock Crater they can see JB s Planetarium
They all stop to smell the flowers which make them all fall asleep
Tak uses a Woodie Catapult to cause destruction in the Dream World finally making it to the Tower where the Dream Guardian is at
But he goes through a rift and is told that his next sleep will put him in the tower
He and Jibolba wake up leaving Lok and Dead Juju
Tak and Jibolba go through the Crater and make it to the Planetarium
But inside the area is overrun by Power Parasites and after a long fight JB is saved
JB tells them that he has never heard of a Dream Juju
So JB sends Tak into sleep
Tak then enters the tower and has a long battle with the Dream Guardian
After the battle Tak gets The Staff of Dreams
The princess appears and is revealed to be Pins and Needles and the Dream Juju reveals to be Tlaloc still in Sheep form
Pins Needles and Tak all struggle for the Staff and Needles gets one half The Staff of Nightmares and Tak gets the other the Dream Shaker
This power causes all to enter the real world and Pins Needles and Tlaloc escape
Tak then begins a chase of them not watching where he is going and gets knocked out
When he wakes up Tak is in the Moon Juju Interlude and the Moon Juju was before him
She tells him to choose one of four Spirit Animals
Before she tells Tak the best one she disappears
Tak chooses which wakes him up with new powers
Tak meets the Giant Misunderstanding and needed help with the rift
The Giant thought he wanted to talk to Rick
Tak repeated the Rick question to the juju to unlock the rift
When he said goodbye the Giant sang a song
During the chase Flora and Fauna granted Tak the ability to become 4 animals
Tak was tired when he came to the Dream Fortress
He battled Pins and Needles and got the other half of the staff
Lok mistakenly gave the half to Tlaloc
Tak battles Tlaloc s army of sheep
After defeating all of the sheep Tak attacks Tlaloc knocking him over a ledge and killing him
Jibolba Dead Juju and Lok congratulate Tak on his victory and remind him they need to return the staff
Lok questions the appearance of an arm behind Tak which pulls him through a rift and back into the Dream Realm
The arm turns out to belong to Tlaloc who after being killed in the real world is now a nightmare creature and has his old body again
He uses the Staff of Nightmare to turn into a monster resembling the Dream Guardian
Tak does the same with his staff to fight Tlaloc
After the battle the Dream Guardian appears asking for the staff back
Tak apologized to the Dream Guardian who opens a rift to return Tak to the real world
Back in the real world Jibolba Lok and Dead Juju congratulate Tak again before Tlaloc appears again realizing he can never defeat Tak
He decides to instead kill his friends to eliminate Tak s will to fight
Tak manages to save his friends and defeat Tlaloc a third time
Tak is then waken up by Jibolba and Lok telling him the whole thing was a dream
The three walk off while being spied on by a sheep from Tlaloc s army

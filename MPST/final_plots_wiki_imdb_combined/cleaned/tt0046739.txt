He runs out into an alley where it is revealed that the thief is an adult midget on stilts Ant Hill Harry alias Baby Face Finster
He throws the money into a nearby baby carriage and disguises himself as a baby to evade capture
When the police pass by he gets out and the carriage rolls down the hill smashing into a rock and sending the money flying into Bugs hole
Bugs is overjoyed to suddenly be showered with money but Finster is less impressed and begins working on a scheme to get the money back Finster uses his baby disguise to convince Bugs he is an abandoned child and Bugs takes him in
Finster initially dives for the money but Bugs forces him away from it and puts him in a playpen
Finster responds by holding his breath until he turns blue and a concerned Bugs gives him the money Later Bugs tries to give Finster some milk but discovers he has escaped from his playpen
Finster almost escapes with the money after whacking Bugs over the head with it but Bugs takes him back in and puts the money on a high shelf
Finster responds by threatening Bugs with a toy pistol which he fires and leaves Bugs substantially dazed
Bugs then decides to put Finster to bed After being tucked in Finster beats Bugs with a baseball bat when he tries to turn out the lights
After this happens twice Bugs tests Finster by saying Click and is promptly beaten
Finster makes it appear as though he were having a nightmare so Bugs lets him be Bugs goes to turn on the television but the signal is distorted by a loud buzzing noise
Bugs peers into the bathroom keyhole and discovers a quite hairy and tattooed Finster shaving
He is surprised but a TV report comes on at that moment describing Finster as a bank robber who supposedly held up a bank earlier in the day
Realizing what has been happening all this time Bugs tracks Finster down and intentionally torments him culminating with Finster accidentally stabbing himself in the buttocks with a knife and swearing heavily

The author Arshaluys Mardiganian was born in the city of Çemişgezek near Harput Ottoman Empire
She was the daughter of a wealthy Armenian financier in the city
The story starts in 1915 when Arshaluys was 14 years old
She personally witnessed the murder of her father mother brothers and sisters
She was taken to the harem of a number of Turkish pashas but had remained attached to her Christian Armenian faith despite being tortured repeatedly at the hands of her captors
She found refuge with Frederick W MacCallum a Canadian doctor and missionary stationed with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions who safely returned her to Erzurum which had come under Russian control
She later moved to Tbilisi in the Caucasus and through the mediation of General Andranik Ozanian and orders of the Russian military leadership in the Caucasus was sent to the United States for recovery and to bear witness to the sufferings of the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire
Aurora Mardiganian a survivor of the Armenian genocide of 1915 1923 recalled sixteen young Armenian girls being crucified by their Ottoman tormentors
The film Auction of Souls which was based on her book Ravished Armenia showed the victims nailed to crosses
However almost 70 years later Mardiganian revealed to film historian Anthony Slide that the scene was inaccurate
She described what was actually an impalement
She stated that The Turks didn t make their crosses like that
The Turks made little pointed crosses
They took the clothes off the girls
They made them bend down and after raping them they made them sit on the pointed wood through the vagina
That s the way they killed the Turks
Americans have made it a more civilized way
They can t show such terrible things
The book was written by journalist Henry Leyford Gates whose novelist wife Eleanor Brown Gates became Mardiganian s legal guardian in America

In order to rid the town of the children Alan devises a plan to detonate a briefcase of explosives inside the children s classroom
By thinking of a brick wall he is able to create a mental barrier and keep the presence of the bomb a secret from the children
Jill begs him to spare David because he is not like the others and Alan agrees
He attempts to do this by asking David to leave the classroom to get his notebook from his car

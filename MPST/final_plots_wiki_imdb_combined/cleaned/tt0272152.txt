In 1990 a white male is picked up by the New York Police after being found bending over the victim of a mugging at Grand Central Terminal in midtown Manhattan
After responding to the police questions with somewhat strange answers he is transferred to Bellevue Hospital for evaluation
Although not physically ill he is found to harbour the strange delusion that he is from a planet called K PAX in the constellation of Lyra
The patient who calls himself prot is eventually transferred to the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute where he becomes the patient of Dr Gene Brewer
Prot is extremely fond of fruit including banana skins and apple cores which he eats during each session
He tells Brewer that he is 337 years old that he has visited Earth often and that on this visit he has traveled to most of the world s countries for the past 4 years and 9 months
He has a good sense of humor
Brewer discovers that prot also possesses arcane information about astronomy which later astronomers become very excited about prot appears to be a savant
Prot also claims to understand most human languages as well as the languages of animals including whale song and the apparent gibberish of some of the patients with schizophrenia
Though prot s dialogue is usually satirical he turns out to be highly suggestible and easily hypnotized
Once Brewer learns this he begins more serious therapy
Brewer with the help of a journalist named Giselle Griffin discovers that prot may be an alter ego of Robert Porter whose life has been devastated by the murder of his wife and child and his subsequent killing of the perpetrator
Brewer speculates that the name prot is derived presumably from Porter
When prot returns to his own planet Robert Porter is left in a catatonic state
However Bess disappears along with a box of souvenirs prot has been collecting
Prot promises to return in about five of your years

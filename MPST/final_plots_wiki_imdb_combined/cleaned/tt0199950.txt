In July 1890 Pinocchio and his friend Lampwick skip school to go to a carnival
While there they watch a presentation by the carnival s leader Madame Flambeau
She gives a man with one shorter leg some of her Elixir and his leg grows to the length of the other one
The carnival s dwarf then leads Pinocchio and Lampwick to The Hall of Freaks a place with a clown that washes his face an albino who can blow fire from his mouth a large fish tank that have fish with human faces a woman with a beard and a fairy called Blue who only Pinocchio can see
They then return to Pinocchio s house and find his father Geppetto who is very sick
Pinocchio and Lampwick then return to the carnival to each buy some of Madame Flambeau s Elixir
Felinet and Volpe a human cat and human fox respectively lead them to Madame Flambeau
They don t have enough money for the Elixir so they agree to work for her in the carnival
Lampwick drinks his Elixir and returns home and Pinocchio gives his Elixir to Geppetto
The next morning Pinocchio finds the Elixir has transformed his father into a puppet
Madame Flambeau enters their house and gets angry at Pinocchio for giving the Elixir to his father instead of himself
She reveals she is Lorenzini s widow
Geppetto and Pinocchio are then forced to work at the carnival s show
Geppetto eventually accepts and enjoys being a puppet much to Pinocchio s dismay
Lampwick had been transformed into a sea donkey because of the Elixir and Pinocchio finds him in the large fish tank
Madame Flambeau compromises Pinocchio that if he becomes a puppet then Geppetto and Lampwick will automatically become human again but this was a trick so that Pinocchio would perform in front of the prince
Seconds before the show the dwarf takes Pinocchio Felinet and Volpe take Geppetto and replace the two with inanimate puppets
The prince angrily leaves due to the audience booing
Madame Flambeau and her team go on a search for Geppetto and Pinocchio
The dwarf takes Pinocchio and Lampwick to the forest where Pinocchio came from
The dwarf transforms and reveals himself as Pepe
Madame Flambeau finds Geppetto and then finds Pinocchio
Geppetto apologizes to Pinocchio for being more interested in his fame than his son and it is implied he wants to be human again
Madame Flambeau then transforms into Lorenzini a secret he had been hiding the whole time
He plans on cooking Lampwick using Pinocchio and Geppetto as the firewood
Pepe gives Pinocchio clues on how to find the Heart of the Mountain
Pinocchio Geppetto and Lampwick get to the Heart of the Mountain via sliding down a long pathway
Once there they find a pool called the magic water something that turns someone something into their true nature
Lorenzini and the others also enter the Heart of the Mountain
Lampwick falls into the water and is instantly restored to human
Lorenzini laughs and jumps in the magic water thinking it will make him powerful but it instead turns him into the sea monster over a period of time
Geppetto and Pinocchio then jump in and are instantly restored to human
Volpe and Felinet jump in but their true nature remains
The next day Lorenzini is locked up in a cage and is laughed at by the carnival s audience for his grotesque sea monster appearance
Pinocchio and Lampwick go to see Geppetto s puppet show along with a girl called Isabella who looks just like Blue but with black hair
Isabella tells Pinocchio that the Elixir can t truly fix anyone s troubles
Geppetto performs in front of the prince and is applauded by Pinocchio and the rest of the audience
As the second lot of credits roll by Lorenzini escapes his prison

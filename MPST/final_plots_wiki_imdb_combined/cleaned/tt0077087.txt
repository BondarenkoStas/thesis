Norman Dack Rambo starred as Jack Martin Cole who had emerged from an unjust prison sentence to become a rich playboy by day and a troubleshooting mercenary at night à la The Saint
Bert Rosario co starred as Hector Ramirez a former petty crook who was Cole s junior partner and former cell mate and Alex Courtney another series regular appeared as Arthur Woods an attorney who had unsuccessfully defended Cole on criminal charges who from his involvement in that case was motivated to head a special federal task force for the Justice Department to fight white collar crime
His associate and partner in the task force was a federal agent known only by the family name of Buckner
Cole had previously been a full time playboy but his family had powerful enemies who framed him for embezzlement
Arthur Woods defended Cole at his trial but without success
After being wrongly convicted he served a prison sentence for the crimes he had not committed à la The Rockford Files Ramirez became his cell mate during this period
During his confinement Cole s parents died and his family fortune was almost totally destroyed by their enemies
Bitter hateful and rage filled as a direct result of his misfortunes Cole swore revenge
To that end once he returned to prison after attending his dead parents funerals he learned how to crack safes break into banks and most of the other secrets of the criminal trade
Upon his release he decided to turn the tables on such above the law criminals as he blamed for his misfortunes by fighting them at their own game à la It Takes a Thief and using a unique way to leave his message the 3 from a deck of cards indicating how many years he spent behind bars
On these cards would be a written warning for the criminal
The three of clubs would read The club is the sign of vengeance it holds no man as friend
However he would also leave clues for Woods to follow not revealing his true identity
He would leave these with the three of diamonds
In the first installment of the series A Double Life this card read A diamond s suit means Fill your cup with wealth and worldly things
If there were persons Cole was assisting or protecting he would leave the three of hearts with them
Presumably the heart indicated compassion concern caring and a wish not to see this person come to harm
The three of spades would mark the end of the game and this card read The spade is the sword of justice its rapier marks the end
In the pilot installment later re edited into the made for television film A Double Life the club was the sword the spade the vengeance sign
The second series installment Aloha Julie Lang reversed this
The primary enemy Cole brought down in Sword Of Justice A Double Life was played by Larry Hagman foreshadowing the later mutual hostility of their respective characters on Dallas

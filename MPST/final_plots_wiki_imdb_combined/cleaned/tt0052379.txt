We open with the title and credits in white font on a black background and a score by composer conductor Walter Greene
A star field is crossed by a satellite as observed in a control room at an observatory
The assembled scientists and politicians argue over the tenth mission
Jason ibn Akad chides Dr Pol Van Ponder about his lack of success and waste of half a billion dollars on a satellite project Project Sigma that hits a barrier in space and is destroyed
Cole Hotchkiss reminds Akad that its still in it s orbit Mr
Akad
Akad asks Sybil Carrington for her thoughts but she deflects the query with her analytical reply I correlate observed data Mr Akad I make no predictions
Mr LeMoine quickly injects I ll make a prediction
All those men in that satellite will die as have all the others
And when they do your project comes to an end doctor
Dave Boyer announces to the assembled The satellite is approaching the critical area
All gather around the screen and watch the latest satellite encounter and then be destroyed by a force field
Van Ponder announces that he will launch another satellite A young couple are parked under a moon lit sky necking in their car
Jay and Mitzi see a light in the sky
At first they assume it is a shooting star then realize it is something else when it crashes
They investigate and discover a small rocket with a message in Latin for the world
Sybil reads the translated message to the United Nations
The aliens warn the inhabitants of the earth that their contamination shall not be allowed to spread
Any attempt to depart the Earth will be stopped
The President opens discussion regarding the message Van Ponder calls a press conference in his office
He announces another satellite mission that he himself will lead
Sybil tells Dave she will accompany her boss
Van Ponder does admit some misgivings to Dave and Sybil but training and crew selection start
Hotchkiss calls Van Ponder and warns him that Akad is trying to stop the mission
Van Ponder drives over to the U N
Along the way he experiences trouble with his car and crashes
The aliens cause his wreck then replace him with one of their own
Hotchkiss announces Dr Van Ponder was killed in an automobile accident while on his way to this forum
To the shock of the assembled Van Ponder arrives at the U N to spontaneous applause
After Hotchkiss leaves Van Ponder s office the alien demonstrates one of his capabilities to duplicate himself
The alien reports to his masters that a stronger warning is proposed but before we learn any details of the plan Dave enters Van Ponder s office to persuade Van Ponder to keep Sybil off the launch of the next satellite
Sybil enters Van Ponder s office and tells him to turn on the radio
Reports of worldwide disasters are blamed on the aliens
Van Ponder capitulates to the threat and calls off the next mission
Dave and Sybil attend the U N meeting and Dave without consulting with Van Ponder tells the assembled delegates that We must proceed with project Sigma at all costs
As Dave and Van Ponder go over launch parameters John Campo enters the room and registers surprise at Van Ponder s presence
He remarks that he just saw Van Ponder at the Proving Grounds
The new solenoids have arrived and he wants Dave to check them
Dave notices a growth on Van Ponders arm
Dave reminds Van that he should have it removed
Dave sees another identical growth on his other arm
His curiosity piqued Dave records the license plate on Van s Lincoln in the parking lot
Dave drives away
Meanwhile Van goes down to the lab where John is welding a component
John puts the welding torch down on the component and directs Van s attention to the solenoids
The torch is bumped and rotates the flame directly onto Van Ponder s right hand
Feeling no pain at all his hand is quickly charred
John notices and pulls Van s hand away from the flame and runs for medical attention
Van Ponder shuts off the acetylene
Using his good hand he removes the char from his burnt hand revealing an intact and perfectly restored and normal right hand
When John returns with Dr Howard Lazar Van Ponder pretends nothing happened and that John Compo must be hallucinating
John on the verge of hysteria concludes There s something about you
You re not human
Dave stops at an auto wrecking yard and discovers the bumper of Van Ponder s wrecked car
The license plate number is identical
He concludes the car was so destroyed no one could have survived
He calls Sybil on the phone from a caf√©
She is at the base and informs Dave that the launch schedule was moved up
He has forty five minutes to get to the launch site
At the launch command center a tech hands the ground controller final corrections on the calculations
Dr Lazar arrives at the elevator with John Compo and tells Van Ponder that John is cleared to fly
Dave witnesses Van Ponder s ability to duplicate himself
His suspicions are now confirmed Van Ponder is an alien and means to sabotage the mission Aboard flight 1 Sybil straps herself into her Contour Chaise Lounge while Van Ponder checks on the flight crew and John
Dave joins Dr Lazar on flight 2 for their departure
The ground controller handles the rocket stage separations and the assembly of the satellite components
The pilot astronavigator and co pilot prepare the craft for its mission
Van Ponder goes to visit John Compo
He places his hand on John s chest immobilizing him
Van Ponder reveals himself and his mission before he kills John
Sybil walks in to the compartment
Van Ponder explains that John couldn t handle the g force acceleration
Dave tries to convince Sybil that Van Ponder is an alien but Van Ponder enters and interrupts
John s body is buried in space
Dave meets with Dr Lazar and tells him John was murdered
He has the doctor examine Van Ponder s finger prints
Dave tells Sybil that the mounting evidence points to an alien imposter
Dr Lazar goes to confront Van Ponder and give him the required medical exam
But before the doctor can check Van s heart an urgent call from the pilot interrupts
The satellite is approaching the Sigma barrier
Upon his return Van activates a heartbeat
It is a new sensation and he visibly reacts
Van Ponder encounters Sybil on his way back to the doctor
He expresses his new found desire for Sybil
She is confused
She excuses herself I m in the middle of a computation
Van submits to the doctor s cardiac exam
When Van tries the same hand on the chest routine to dispatch Dr Lazar as he did with John he is surprised to see that it doesn t work
He kills Dr Lazar by choking him Sybil finally suspects Dave may be right about Van Ponder when under Van Ponder s orders two crewmembers arrest Dave
On her way to find Dr Lazar Sybil sees Van Ponder placing the doctor s body in the disposal chute
Van Ponder sees Sybil and gives chase
She hides in the Solar Energy room
Dave escapes his guards and Van Ponder is informed over the PA system
The Sigma barrier forms while Van Ponder is trying to decide whether or not to kill Sybil
He splits himself into two confirming Sybil s suspicion
One remains to confront Sybil while the other heads for the command center or bridge
She asks You re not human
Who are you
What are you
Dave follows Van ponder into his cabin and shoots him in the hand
Both Van Ponders bleed
Dave and Van scuffle and Dave gets the gun back and shoots Van Ponder several times
While Dave s Van Ponder collapses the one confronting Sybil also falls to the deck
Dave orders Plan B be abandoned and Plan A be activated much to the flight crew s relief
Both Van Ponders disappear
The Solar Accumulator is deployed against the barrier but Sybil is still in the Solar Energy Room and is rescued by Dave
The Solar Accumulator works and the Sigma barrier is broken
The closing shot is the satellite in orbit over the Earth

It depicts the final days of Agnes who is near death due to cancer
Her sisters Maria and Karin have returned to the family home to be with her
However the two women remain distant and awkward struggling to comfort their sister while dealing with the shock and the fear of mortality Agnes death may bring
The deeply religious maid Anna whose own daughter died at an early age is the only person in the house able to comfort the dying woman
At length Agnes dies and during her wake the priest declares Agnes faith was stronger than his own
In a dream like sequence that follows Agnes seemingly returns to life for a short moment and asks her sisters one last time for the love and care denied to her during her lifetime
For a moment Karin Maria and Agnes grow closer to each other but this is short lived when the two sisters realize that Agnes is actually dead with Karin declaring such acts morbid and disgusting
Once again only Anna is able to embrace and comfort Agnes
The film is characterized by flashbacks that visit the characters lives and their memories tracing each woman s personality to the childhood they spent together
Maria remembers her affair with a handsome doctor juxtaposed with her failed marriage to her ineffectual husband Agnes remembers her unrequited devotion to their distant mother and Karin struggles with self harm self mutilating her sexual organs to drive her husband away
The last flashback from the deceased Agnes point of view is narrated via her diary and shows her sisters descending upon the house clad in white like angels
The last words are Agnes whispering Come what may this is happiness
I cannot wish for anything better
Now for a few minutes I can experience perfection
And I feel profoundly grateful to my life which gives me so much

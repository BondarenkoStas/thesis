Feluda his cousin Topshe and the thriller writer Jatayu visit Benaras during the pujas
There they meet a Bengali family
Upon hearing that Feluda is a private investigator the Ghosal family head entrusts him with the task of finding out the thief of the attempted theft that took place in their house
Meanwhile the arrival of a saint by the name of Machhli Baba in Benaras quivers the excitement of the local people
A very valuable property of the Ghosals a golden Ganesh statue about an inch height was the target of the thief
On the other hand Maganlal Meghraj a wealthy Marwari businessman had his eyes on the Ganesh for a very long time
He comes to know about the involvement of Feluda in this case
He invites Feluda Topshe and Jatayu to his house and offers Feluda Rs 2000 so that he leaves this case
Feluda refuses which angers Maganlal and he sets up a knife throwing show using Jatayu as the bait
After the thrilling adventures in Maganlal s house Feluda takes a vow either he will avenge Jatayu s harassment or quit being a sleuth
Although warned by Maganlal Feluda did not lose interest in the case and deduces that Machhli Baba is actually a fraud working for Maganlal
A member of the Ghosal family Bikash was also bribed by Maganlal to steal the Ganesh and hand it over to him
Feluda gets hold of Bikash and makes him confess his involvement in the theft
But Bikash states that when he went to steal the Ganesh it was not there
Several questions arise in Feluda s mind
Where is the Ganesh then
Why the innocent idol maker of the Ghosals Shashi Babu was murdered brutally
What plan did the Ghosal family head hatch upon with his grandson to save the Ganesh
The story has two sub plots
On the one hand it is the story of the acquisitive instinct of a greedy Marwari businessman who would spare no expenses or ways to get what he desires even if it is at the cost of murdering some innocents and bribing the willing
On the other it is also the tale of cautionary foresight exercised by the family head
The sights and sounds and the brilliant cinematography and photographic imagery takes the nostalgic viewer to a lost world of the innocence the beauty and the freshness of a north Indian town that is at once far from the madding corruptibility of big cities
Subaltern texts like the caste and the communal divide do make their presence felt but they exist as subplots that further enrich the viewer s understanding

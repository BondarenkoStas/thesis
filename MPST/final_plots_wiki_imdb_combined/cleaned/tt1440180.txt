At the University of Strasbourg in 1772 young Johann Wolfgang Goethe fails his doctoral examination in law and despite wishing to be a poet is sent by his father to work in the Reichskammergericht the imperial law court in the small town of Wetzlar
Set to read old files by his grim chief Kestner he is befriended by another junior Wilhelm Jerusalem who takes him to a dance
There he sees Lotte Buff daughter of a widower living in an old manor house outside the town where she looks after her seven younger siblings
Developing a closer friendship with the attractive and lively young woman one day he encounters her on a country road
A sudden rain storm forces the two to seek shelter in a ruined castle where they make love
Meanwhile Kestner has been negotiating with her father who is delighted to see his impoverished family helped by the marriage of his eldest girl to a distinguished lawyer
Though not in the least charmed by Kestner for the sake of the family Lotte reluctantly agrees he may woo her
Unaware of her relationship with Goethe and without mentioning her name Kestner asks him to be best man
Goethe agrees heartily and even suggests some good phrases he could use in his wooing
Accepting Kestner out of duty Lotte writes to Goethe to tell him their affair is at an end
Before he gets the letter he sets out for her house with a present only to find her engagement party in full swing
Returning despondent to his lodgings he then sees his room mate Jerusalem blow his brains out in despair over his hopeless love for a married woman
After briefly contemplating suicide himself he returns to work and publicly insults Kestner who demands a duel
Given first shot he misses whereupon Kestner fires wide and has him arrested for illegal duelling
In jail Goethe turns these events into a story he calls The Sorrows of Young Werther and sends the manuscript to Lotte as a farewell gift
She sees its qualities and without telling him takes it to a publisher
Once Goethe is released from prison his father takes him home to Frankfurt where the book has become a sensation and the young author a celebrity

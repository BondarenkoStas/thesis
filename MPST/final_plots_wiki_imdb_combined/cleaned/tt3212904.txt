Mallory is a young bride to be on her way to Denver for her wedding rehearsal
She video chats with her sister Ella on her way there
Ella tells her that she hasn t bought her plane tickets yet because she wants to make sure Mallory is actually in love and happy with her decisions
Mallory responds by telling her she s happy in a fake voice
She hangs up with her sister and continues driving
A few minutes later her car breaks down unexpectedly
She tries calling AAA but she has no service
She also tries doing some tricks under the hood of the car but to no avail
While Mallory tries changing her clothes near the back of the car she spots a man Christian
She quickly puts on a tank top and tells him her situation
He eventually gets her car started for her
She then says she would offer him a ride but was in a rush
She starts to drive away but out of guilt stops and offers him a ride
Along the way he starts acting odd
He talks about how fate brought them together and how it was supposed to happen like this
He then tells her how she couldn t deepthroat his huge cock
She then stops and tells him to get out
He pulls out a knife and tells her to drive
She notices his seat belt is off and tries to kill him by speeding towards a guardrail near a curve
They crash violently
Mallory wakes up to find the car upside down
She unhooks her seat belt but she can t get out
She notices her leg is caught and pinned between the seat all bloody
She tries pushing out but fails
Christian slowly wakes up and tells her she needs to get herself out of this one and leaves her
She tries honking her horn and screaming for help but no one can hear her
Mallory slips on a hoodie and drinks the last bit of her water bottle
The following morning Christian comes back and eats and drinks in front of her
He tells her how this was supposed to happen and how fate is a funny thing
That night a bunch of rats come in and slather around her
She kills one of them and eats a strip of its meat and drinks her own urine
Christian comes back and tells her how he s holding a family hostage and pretending to be a police officer
He then gives her a saw
At first Mallory thinks he gave it to her to cut through the seat but he tells her he doesn t expect it to and how if she doesn t cut off her leg she s going to die
That night a huge rainstorm hits and Christian comes to say his goodbyes but she attacks him and throws his car keys outside to where he can t find them
A police car pulls up from the curve he runs and tells the officer his car won t start
The officer tells him he ll give him a ride but hears Mallory s scream
The officer thinks he s imagining things and drives away with Christian
The car starts to flood and she starts trying to cut her leg off but barely makes a few superficial cuts before her leg comes free out of the seat due to the assistance of the flood
She makes it out and goes to the cabin where Christian says he was at
She discovers he killed the police officer and the parents and he s keeping the daughter Katie hostage
She aims a gun she found and tells him if he moves she shoots
He attacks Mallory as Katie runs out the front door
Mallory twists his nose and elbows his stomach before running
She hides under a table he finds her and she gets up and runs
He smashes her into a mirror but she manages to keep him down on the ground long enough for her to run upstairs
Christian looks for her upstairs but Mallory sneaks from behind a dresser creeps behind him and pushes him off of a second story balcony and he falls and crushes his leg into a bear trap
She limps downstairs and gives him his knife and tells him how fate really brought this together and she s going to give him the same chance that he gave her
Christian soon succumbs to his wound and dies
The final scene shows Mallory limping down the road with Katie as the front door of the house slams shut

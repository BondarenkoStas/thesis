Jefferson Rose a young Boulder Nevada newspaper publisher tries to run for mayor of his corrupt town
His father in law Captain Oren Hayes is a former Texas Ranger who happens to visit town the day Jefferson is roughed up by a few of the Sheriff s finest
Captain Hayes admires young Jefferson s desire to clean up the corrupt politicians and decides that he and three of his pals will come to town and take care of business for young Jefferson Each of Hayes three friends had something unique to offer the Texas Rangers
The first pal was the quickest draw
The second had eyes in the day like an eagle and at night like an owl
The third had spotless character courtly manners and spit and polished appearance
By the time Hayes telegram finds each of them we see that they aren t quite what they used to be slow near blind and a card cheat When their first attempt at riding into Boulder and ridding it of the nasty trio of Sheriff Barnes Mayor Lundy and Judge Polk doesn t go over so well they reconvene and decide to try to divide and conquer
The Sheriff becomes convinced that Mayor Lundy has hired one of the Rangers to kill him
The Judge becomes convinced that the Mayor is going to dump him after the election because of some unmerited early releases from prison While the Texas Rangers succeed in convincing the Sheriff and the Judge that the Mayor is out to get them they don t quite outsmart the Mayor
In fact the Mayor hires several outlaws to do the work for him
This requires the Rangers to really think about their next move
The end result is a shoot out at Cassie s Corral that is clever surprising and cheesy all at once

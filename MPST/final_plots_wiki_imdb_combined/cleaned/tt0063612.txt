Prologue As a cartoon character dressed in prison stripes executes a few dance steps to the music of Nilsson s Skidoo theme the words Otto Preminger appear below him
Additional words presents SKIDOO starring can also be seen as the camera pulls back to reveal that this image is on a TV screen while Carol Channing s voice is heard exclaiming No Harry not that
No I don t wanna see that with the channel suddenly switching to show a US Senate hearing conducted by Senator Hummel portrayed by Peter Lawford who asks a series of organized crime figures various questions to which they invariably reply I refuse to answer on the grounds it may tend to incriminate me
Every few seconds the channel showing the hearing switches to another channel which is screening Preminger s black and white 1965 feature In Harm s Way or still other channels which have one spurious commercial after another
The initial ad depicts an attractive blonde declaring now you too can be beautiful and sexually desirable like me instead of being that fat disgusting foul breathed slimy wallowing sow that you are the second has another intensely smiling blonde stating that maybe we blondes do have more fun and the third ad depicts a drunken slob swilling beer and belching interspersed with an image of a pig with beer foam around its snout while an unseen announcer exclaims feel big drink pig
After another switch to In Harm s Way Channing s voice is again heard complaining no Harry I don t like films on TV
They always cut them to pieces
Additional channel changes produce more images of the beer pig then another scene from In Harm s Way followed by an ad for Fat Cola with three generously proportioned middle aged women wearing bathing suits beach hats and carrying little parasols gyrating to the jingle You ll never lose your man if you drink fat cola you ll never have to worry about losing him then an ad showing a boy and a girl both about six years old dressed like adults at a picnic setting next to a dog resembling Our Gang s Pete the Pup with all three vigorously emitting smoke from long cigarettes held in their mouths while happy young voices sing the jingle Puff puff puff puff puff if you want to have a girly you must puff puff puff
The following ad shows a family including small children standing in front of their house all holding guns with the father declaring get a gun for everyone in your family remember for family fun get your gun while the next ad for New Daisy Chain Deodorant has a male voice followed a female voice singing ever more insistently I want my deodorant I want my deodorant Next a balding mustachioed pitchman presents a fast talking spiel that if you re bothered by dandruff athlete s foot and the common cold cancer birth defects mental illness ringworm poison ivy tooth decay acne measles brain tumor smallpox syphilis plague influenza hepatitis and St Vitus Dance well you re in luck friend
Pick a pack of Peter s perfidious pink pacifying placebo pills At that point Jackie Gleason Carol Channing and Arnold Stang are shown sitting in front of the TV with Gleason and Channing at war each with a remote control and switching channels
Gleason and Stang subsequently go to the kitchen and as they come out the TV screen shows combative 1960s TV personality Joe Pyne commenting on the hearings and as one witness follows another Senator Hummel is getting the same answer Senator Kefauver got in 1950 and 1951 Storyline Tony Banks a retired mob torpedo now settled with wife Flo and daughter Darlene worries about his daughter s new hippie boyfriend Stash and his own paternity of Darlene
A father and son pair of mob bosses Hechy and Angie bring Tony the news that top mobster God wants him to carry out one last job liquidating his old pal Blue Chips Packard before Packard can testify before the US Senate s Crime Commission
Tony refuses but upon discovering another old friend Harry shot through the head goes along with God s wishes and now wearing a convict s striped outfit finds himself in the island prison of Alcatraz a futuristic high tech institution where Packard is held under top level protection
In Tony s absence Stash and his friends who have been charged with vagrancy are invited by Flo to stay at their house
She visits Angie to persuade him to either cancel the job or take her to God so she can ask personally
Angie won t take Flo but he will take Darlene who nonetheless insists on bringing Stash along
God takes a liking to Darlene as does God s tall supermodel like black mistress to Stash but both are frustrated in their pursuit
One of Tony s cellmates turns out to be a draft dodger called Fred the Professor an electronics wizard who has renounced technology but makes an exception in rigging a television set to allow Banks the opportunity of cell to cell communication with Packard
Banks realizes he can t kill his old friend and as a result will probably never leave the prison
He writes his wife with the news on stationery borrowed from Fred while ignoring Fred s admonition not to lick the envelope and discovering the hard way that all the stationery is soaked with LSD enough to send the whole prison on a bad trip
One of the inmates Leech says Hey maybe if I take some of that stuff I wouldn t have to rape anybody anymore
Fred guides Tony through the resulting acid experience helping him come to terms with his worries about Darlene and his past while plotting their escape
Darlene and Stash spend the night aboard God s yacht with Stash getting word back to Flo and his friends about their location and a coded plea for help
As the hippies mount a rescue Tony and Fred build a makeshift balloon from discarded freezer bags and garbage cans dump the whole supply of stationery into the prison s lunch and fly out of the prison as everyone below begins to freak out
As it happens both the hippies and the balloon arrive on God s hideaway at the same time
Feeling trapped God adopts a stooped Groucho posture skulks into a closet in his cabin and closes the door
Flo and Tony are last seen as Flo pulls Tony toward a bed in one of the yacht s empty side cabins while in the main cabin God s Skipper holding open a copy of Gabriel Vahanian s 1961 book The Death of God performs a marriage ceremony between Angie and God s Mistress who then proceeds to become overly affectionate with surprised best man father figure Hechy as the dismayed Angie tries to separate them
Behind them another ceremony performed by a hippie minister named Geronimo using the Skipper s Death of God book joins this brother and this sister in holy union
Next in calm waters a small sailboat with sails decorated in large psychedelic designs of the words LOVE and PEACE holds two occupants Fred the Professor and God both dressed in Hare Krishna transcendental meditation garb
Nilsson s voice is heard singing I Will Take You There as they smile beatifically while sharing a lit joint and after taking a puff God murmurs mmm pumpkin
Epilogue As the final scene becomes a freeze frame shot Otto Preminger s familiar accented voice is heard intoning Stop we are not through yet and before you skidoo we d like to introduce our cast and crew The entire credit sequence is then sung by Nilsson with various asides

A rich widow lives with her daughter and her stepdaughter
The widow favored her biological daughter allowing her to become spoiled and idle while her stepdaughter was left to do all the work
Every day the stepdaughter would sit outside the cottage and spin beside the well
One day she pricked her finger on the point of the spindle
Leaning over the well to wash the blood away the spindle fell from her hand and sank out of sight
The stepdaughter feared that she would be punished for losing the spindle and in a panic she leapt into the well after it
The girl found herself in a meadow where she came upon an oven full of bread
The bread asked to be taken out before it burned
With a baker s peel she took all the loaves out and then walked on
Then she came to an apple tree that asked that its apples be harvested
So she did so and gathered them into a pile before continuing on her way
Finally she came to a small house of an old woman who offered to allow the girl to stay if she would help with the housework
The woman identified herself as Frau Holle and cautioned the girl to shake the featherbed pillows and coverlet well when she made the bed as that would make it snow in the girl s world
The girl agreed to take service with Frau Holle and took care to always shake the featherbed until the feathers flew about like snowflakes
After a time the girl became homesick and told Frau Holle that it was time for her to return home
Frau Holle had been impressed by the girl s kindness and hard work so much that when she escorted the girl to the gate a shower of gold fell upon the girl
She also gave her the spindle which had fallen into the well
With that the gate was closed and the girl found herself back not far from her mother s house
Her mother wished the same good fortune for her own daughter
She also set her to sit by the well and spin but the girl deliberately threw the spindle into the well before jumping in herself
She too came to the oven but would not assist the bread nor would she help the apple tree
When she came to Frau Holle s house she likewise took service there but before long fell into her lazy careless ways
Frau Holle soon dismissed her
As the lazy girl stood at the gate a kettle of pitch spilled over her
That is what you have earned said Frau Holle and closed the gate
Other versions describe the first girl having a piece of gold fall from her lips every time she speaks whilst the second has a toad fall from her lips everytime she speaks
That is why in Hessen whenever it snows they say that Frau Holle is making her bed

The film documents Becker s rise to near stardom following him from the first time he touched a guitar as a five year old to when he was drafted into The David Lee Roth Band as lead guitarist at the age of 19
In 1990 this was considered perhaps the most coveted rock guitar gig on the planet as Becker would be following in the footsteps of acclaimed guitarists Eddie van Halen and Steve Vai both of whom played with David Lee Roth as lead guitar player
It was shortly after that Becker was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis more popularly known as Lou Gehrig s disease and given just 3 to 5 years to live
Becker was able to finish the recording of Roth s third full length studio album A Little Ain t Enough but was unable to make the tour due to his physical decline
Despite his diagnosis Becker continued to write music even after losing all the ability to move and speak
Becker would go on to write and record two full length studio albums Perspective and Collection

The film makes extensive use of Becker s family archives through photographs Super 8mm film and VHS footage
The film features interviews with Becker s family and friends as well as notable guitarists Joe Satriani and Steve Vai

Arthur Denning is the owner of a major pharmaceutical firm
He is very controlling of his girlfriend Emily Hynes and she is physically intimidated by his security guards
She is abducted and Denning is sent photos of her bruised face
He is ordered to go to an art gallery with the ransom
When a man approaches him Denning attacks him only to find out later that he was the gallery owner
Before her abduction Hynes reaches out to her ex boyfriend Ben Cahill
Over drinks she hints at Denning s abuse and some dirt she has on him
Back at her apartment she shows Cahill files that she has stolen from Denning s laptop that reveal his criminal behavior during drug trials
She attempts to seduce Cahill
Later she convinces a stranger to beat her up for the photo that she sends to Denning
Cahill uses the information from Hynes to pitch a class action lawsuit to his boss Charles Abrams
Denning settles the suit for 400 million provided that the stolen documents are returned to him
Cahill is stunned to find Hynes dead in her apartment
With a bottle of pills in her hand and a lethal cocktail of drugs in her system her death is suspicious but possibly just a suicide
A short time later her body turns up in Cahill s home
Convinced he is being framed he confronts Denning who is amused at Cahill s passion but assures him that he had nothing to do with it
A hitman kidnaps Cahill and his wife Charlotte
Cahill manages to overpower and kill him
When he inspects the hitman s files he realizes that the villain of the piece is actually Abrams who has been Denning s attorney for years
The settlement was all just an elaborate way of protecting Denning from criminal liability
Cahill submits the hitman s files to the police who arrest Abrams
Before he can be taken into custody Abrams grabs an officer s gun and commits suicide
As Cahill packs for a move to a new house he notices that some of his wife s clothing smells like Hynes perfume
He asks her what happened between the two of them
Charlotte confesses that she confronted Hynes about her involvement with her husband
They had an argument in which Charlotte hit Hynes causing her to fall and hit her head
Though Charlotte is a nurse she did not help her and staged the scene for the police

Philo Vance s dog does not make it into the final of the Long Island Kennel Club s dog show
Fellow competitor Archer Coe is disappointed having hoped to savor a victory over Vance
Coe is found dead the next morning in his bedroom locked from the inside
District Attorney Markham and Police Sergeant Heath assume it was suicide because he was shot through the head and was found holding a pistol
Vance is not convinced
He soon finds evidence that Coe was murdered
Coroner Dr Doremus determines the victim died of a stab wound
There is no shortage of suspects Coe was very much disliked
His niece Hilda Lake resented her uncle s tight control of her finances and jealousy of any men who showed interest in her
Her boyfriend Sir Thomas MacDonald suspected Coe of killing his dog to ensure winning the competition
Raymond Wrede the dead man s secretary was in love with Miss Lake but had been laughed at when he sought Coe s support
Coe s next door neighbor and lover Doris Delafield had been cheating on him with Eduardo Grassi
When Coe found out he cancelled a contract to sell his collection of Chinese artworks to the Milan museum for which Grassi worked
Liang the cook had worked long hard and illegally to help Coe amass his collection
He warned his employer against the proposed sale and was fired as a result
Even Coe s own brother Brisbane despised Coe
Finally Gamble the head servant had concealed his criminal past
Brisbane Coe becomes Vance s prime suspect
His alibi of taking a train at the time of the murder is disproved
When he is found dead in a closet Vance is both puzzled and enlightened
Among Brisbane s effects Vance finds a book titled Unsolved Murders a bookmarked page details a method of using string to lock a door through the keyhole without leaving a trace
Part of the mystery is solved
Later an attempt is made on the life of Sir Thomas using the same dagger used to kill Coe
Finally a Doberman Pinscher belonging to Miss Delafield is found seriously injured apparently struck with a fireside poker
From these and other clues Vance finally solves the crime
It turns out that two men sought Coe s life that night
The successful murderer struggled with Coe and stabbed him leaving him for dead
Coe awakened soon after
Too dazed to recall the fight or notice that he was mortally wounded he went upstairs to his bedroom and opened his window before dying
Brisbane entered the chamber saw his brother apparently asleep in his chair
He shot the corpse and arranged the scene to look like a suicide
Downstairs he ran into the actual killer who had seen that Archer Coe was still alive and came back to finish the job
In the darkness he mistook Brisbane for Archer and killed the wrong man
Delafield s dog then wandered in attracted by the commotion and attacked the murderer
While sure of the killer s identity Vance has no proof
He therefore arranges for Sir Thomas and Wrede to quarrel over Hilda Lake
When Wrede instinctively reaches for the poker to strike his rival the Doberman recognizes its attacker and leaps on him
Wrede confesses he became enraged when Coe refused to assist his courtship of Miss Lake precipitating the stabbing

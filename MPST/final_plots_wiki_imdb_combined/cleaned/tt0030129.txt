The short begins with an establishing shot of a family stereotypical hillbillies the Weavers whose members are all lazy to the point of absurdity
The only thing that awakens the Weavers from their perpetual sloth is the opportunity to feud with their neighbors the McCoys
After a musical number accompanied by a radio commercial the two families begin feuding firing at each other with various semi automatic weapons
At one point a McCoy asks if there are any Weavers in the movie audience
One man shown as a silhouette against the screen answers in the affirmative and fires a shot at the McCoy
In the midst of the fray a yodeling bulbous nosed domestic peace activist who is accompanied by church organ music each time he speaks enters the feud zone on a motorscooter bearing the words Elmer Fudd Peace Maker and goes to each side preaching peace and an end to the bloodshed only to get shot in the back by each family as he departs
When Fudd attempts once more to preach peace to both families from the boundary line both sides get furious at him and open fire on the would be peace maker together
When the smoke clears only Elmer is left standing
He gives a final yodel and says Good night all
and the Weaver in the movie audience yells Good night taking one more shot at the star

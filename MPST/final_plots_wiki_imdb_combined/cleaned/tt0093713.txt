In the late 1850s the elderly emigrant Lasse Karlsson and his son Pelle arrive to the Danish island of Bornholm from Sk√•ne County in southern Sweden
Lasse tells Pelle a better life awaits them in Denmark after the death of Pelle s mother and seeks work
He immediately finds it difficult to find employment given his advanced age and Pelle s youth
The most they can find is work at a large farm where they are generally mistreated by the managers
The managers work under the tyrannical Kongstrup who has a history of affairs leading to illegitimate children
One of them is Rud who befriends Pelle and helps him learn Danish
Eventually Pelle becomes more confident in his work at the farm and begins going to school though he is still discriminated against as a foreigner
Pelle also befriends the Swedish worker Erik constantly harassed for alleged sloth
Erik shares his dream of visiting America China and Negroland with Pelle to conquer the world
Lasse begins an affair with Mrs Olsen who is believed to be a widow since her husband has not returned from a long sea voyage
Pelle consequently faces ridicule at school for being the son of a lecher
Erik is also injured and rendered disabled after attempting to lead a mutiny against management
Mrs Olsen s husband returns from his voyage and Lasse is overcome with depression and alcoholism
The two appeal to the Kongstrups for aid against their harassment with the benign Mrs Kongstrup offering support while her husband who she has castrated for his abuse is largely silent
Pelle is initially given a promotion but upon seeing Erik removed from the farm vows to leave
Lasse at first resolves to go with him before deciding he is too old to travel and sends Pelle alone into the world

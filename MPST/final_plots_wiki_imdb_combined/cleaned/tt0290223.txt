In modern day Tokyo Kagome Higurashi lives on the grounds of her family s Shinto shrine with her mother grandfather and little brother
On her fifteenth birthday when she goes to retrieve her cat a centipede demon bursts out of the enshrined Bone Eater s Well and drags Kagome into it
But instead of hitting the bottom of the well Kagome time travels to the past during Japan s Sengoku period
The centipede demon seeks the Shikon Jewel an artifact that would grant any wish the bearer desires it had previously been defeated by a warrior priestess named Kikyo and Kagome looks just like her
In fact Kagome is a reincarnation of Kikyo and houses the Shikon Jewel in her own body
Kagome finds a young man pinned by a sacred arrow on a tree and in a moment of desperation frees him to defeat the centipede demon
The man is Inuyasha a half dog demon who was pinned by Kikyo for trying to steal the jewel
However the Shikon Jewel is extracted from Kagome s body and in the ensuing fight with another crow demon the jewel is shattered into numerous shards that disperse across ancient Japan falling into the hands of those who then gain the individual shards power
After Inuyasha gains his father s sword Tessaiga and is subdued by a magical necklace to keep him in line he aids Kagome in collecting the shards and dealing with the threats they cause
The two are joined in their quest by the young fox demon Shippo while dealing with third parties groups like Inuyasha s older brother Sesshomaru and the partially revived Kikyo whose own version of what happened years ago brings the events into question
When joined by Miroku a perverted monk whose bloodline is cursed Inuyasha and Kagome learn the truth that the initial conflict between Inuyasha and Kikyo revealed to originally be lovers was caused by a devious half demon named Naraku
The evolving Naraku is revealed to have been born from the soul of an evil man named Onigumo inhabiting a body created by countless demons as part of a pact and who also placed the curse on Miroku s family
Naraku is after the Shikon Jewel shards for his own ends
Inuyasha s group is soon joined after by Sango a demon slayer whose clan was killed when her younger brother Kohaku fell under Naraku s control
Over time Inuyasha enhances Tessaiga powers as he contends with Naraku s minion incarnations like Kagura and the reanimated Band of Seven
Inuyasha s team is loosely allied by Sesshomaru Kikyo and a wolf demon named Koga who wants to avenge his comrades while flirting with Kagome
While Naraku momentarily removes his heart in the form of the Infant who later attempts to overthrow Naraku through his vessel Moryomaru Kohaku regains his freewill and memories as he attempts to help out of guilt for indirectly killing his father
During that time Sesshomaru settles things with Inuyasha to enable his brother to perfect Tessaiga to its optimal abilities
Eventually Koga is forced to stand on the sidelines Kikyo posthumously uses the last of her power to give Kohaku a second chance at life and Naraku finally reassembles the Shikon Jewel
Although Inuyasha and his allies defeat him realizing his true desire is for Kikyo s love despite his hatred towards her and that it can never be granted Naraku uses his wish to trap himself and Kagome in the Shikon Jewel
The jewel intends to have Kagome make a selfish wish so she and Naraku will be trapped in conflict for eternity
But with Inuyasha by her side Kagome wishes for the Shikon Jewel to disappear
The action though causes Kagome to return to her time with the Well sealed and she and Inuyasha lose contact for three years
In that time the Sengoku period changes drastically Sango and Miroku have three children together Kohaku resumes his journey to become a strong demon slayer with Kirara as his companion and Shippo attains the seventh rank as a fox demon
Back in the present Kagome graduates from high school before finally managing to get the Bone Eater s Well in her backyard to work again
Kagome returns to the Sengoku period where she stays with Inuyasha and becomes his wife

After the death of Antony and Cleopatra Egypt is ruled by the young tyrant Pharaoh Nemorat and his mother Tegi
Cleopatra has left a surviving daughter Shila raised by the king and queen of Assyria
When Nemorat conquers Assyria Shila is brought to the Egyptian court and at the instigation of Nemorat s mother marries the pharaoh
The pharaoh who is a mentally disturbed hypochondriac has a good and wise physician Resi who falls in love with Shila and encourages her to go on living despite the killing of her Assyrian surrogate parents by Tegi
When Shila spurns an amorous Nemorat one evening he goes into a violent rage causing him to faint
He is then poisoned by his ambitious chief overseer Kefren and his mistress
Shila is convicted of the murder and is sentenced to be buried alive with Nemorat
Resi comes up with a plan to save Shila by having her take a drug which causes her to lapse into a temporary coma while he bribes the chief of the house of death to allow him to take Shila away in the dead of night
The chief of the house of death proves treacherous by not allowing Resi to rescue Shila but in a struggle with Resi he is killed
Resi though is seriously wounded and is rescued and tended by his faithful servant but he does not recover before Shila is entombed with Pharaoh Nemorat
The common people who have benefited from Resi s kind care of them aid him in capturing the royal architect who helps Resi and his associates greedy tomb robbers to break into Nemorat s tomb and save Shila
Shila and Resi ride off in freedom while Kefren gets his just desserts when Tegi finds out that he really poisoned Nemorat he is killed by the palace guards This film was probably intended to be a story about a New Kingdom pharaoh rather than a Ptolemaic one
The costumes are New Kingdom and the nation of Assyria was destroyed in the 6th century BC before the rise of Rome
The English translation of the Italian title is Sepulchre of the King

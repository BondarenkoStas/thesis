Hooter College student Chuck has decided academics aren t going to get him anywhere in life so he s taken to managing a band his classmates have formed called The Splitz which consists of lead singer Joan guitarist Gina and drummer Susie
The Splitz struggle to make a name for themselves and resort to playing in dive bars where the patrons are more interested in boozing and brawling than appreciating the music
The day after a disastrous show Chuck escorts Gina to her home where he meets her former mobster father who becomes obsessed with the percentage of the band s income that Chuck is claiming
Chuck also meets Gina s cousin Vinnie a sweet but oversexed meathead who can t score a date so Chuck encourages him to try hypnosis
Meanwhile the evil Dean Hunta informs the heads of three sororities that they ll have to compete in a trio of events to determine who s going to lose their house to make way for a new sewage treatment plant
The dean favors Sigma Phi s Lois Scagliani and Delta Phi s Fern Hymenstein and informs them that the Phi Betas have to lose
When asked if she has an axe to grind with the Phi Beta sorority the Dean replies that it s just another act of random senseless violence perpetrated against the underdogs At the first competition a soccer game Gina is disgusted to see the way that Phi Beta s Midge and her peers are being trampled by their competitors so she gets into the game herself and the other Splitz quickly follow suit
Although the Phi Betas lose the game they gain an all girl rock band who immediately become part of their sorority
Gina enlists Warwick a Neanderthal classmate with a crush on Susie to coach the Phi Betas
It still seems like they might lose the next competition so the Splitz pay a visit to the Dean s husband who is a lecherous dentist
They lure him into women s clothing and snap a series of photos of him which they send to the Dean with instructions that she s to let the Phi Betas make their own rules for the forthcoming tournaments
At the wrestling match the Phi Betas make the Sigma Phis don skimpy lingerie and they win the game when one of the ladies bras pops off leaving her dazed and easily pinned
The third and final competition is basketball which the Phi Betas have deemed strip basketball Unfortunately Fern Hymenstein traps Joan in the lockerroom just prior to the game so it looks like the underdogs will lose but Warwick bursts in and rescues her halfway through the game
Although the Phi Betas were victorious in the final two competitions Dean Hunta retaliates by expelling Chuck and the Splitz so Chuck turns to Gina s family for help
He gets Vinnie to use his newfound skills on the Dean and Gina s uncles to book the band into the hottest club in town
The Splitz are shocked to discover the entire school board is present at their big gig and even more surprised that their opening act is a hypnotized Dean Hunta who rips open her dress and sings a bawdy tune to the board members
Then the Splitz take the stage and are instantly a hit so the manager offers them a contract to headline at the club for the next year

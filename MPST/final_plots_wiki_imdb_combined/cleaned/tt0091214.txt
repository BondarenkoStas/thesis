The staff and patients go about their daily business at Buenos Aires José Borda Psychiatric Hospital on a summer day in 1985
A staff psychiatrist Dr Julio Denis is surprised to hear that his ward for non violent delusional cases has one patient too many
Denis finds the patient in the chapel playing the organ like a virtuoso
Summoning him to his office Denis finds the man s speech is measured and articulate as he explains his presence on Earth as a result of his image being projected from light years away
He introduces himself as Rantés
Dr Denis suggests that Rantés might be a fugitive hoping to hide from the law in the hospital
He lets the patient stay however after seeing how his caring touch helps the other patients
The doctor is amused by his extraterrestrial claims and he suspects that the man is a genius using his talents as a charade
Julio Denis is a highly professional lonely man whose recent divorce left him jaded towards his life and work
Since his wife remarried he settles for weekly outings with his two children and grainy home movies of happier times which he views every night
Rantés noticing the wounded Dr Denis is as interested in his troubles as the doctor is in Rantés the first patient in a long time that has interested him at all
Believing his claim to be a projected hologram an allusion to Adolfo Bioy Casares novel Morel s Invention Dr Denis concludes that this impressive genius is very well read
The doctor soon uses his prerogatives to include Rantés in several outings including a visit to a touring Moscow State Circus performance
Rantés is no ordinary man though
Having a psychokinetic gift he quickly finds ways to explore the city on his own and without permission
Compassionate to a fault he uses this gift to the benefit of the hungry narrowly skirting the law
He spends hours standing in one of the Asylum s Courtyards completely motionless facing southeast
He claims to do this to receive transmissions from his planet and that he implies that he is actually the doctor s own hallucination
In narration Dr Denis claims that he appears to be the only physician who still notices the polite unproblematic patient but it s clear in a subsequent scene that he is not since the Doctor gets Rantés a job in the Pathology department of the Hospital
Because of Rantés kindness to everyone he quickly earns the loyalty of the other patients and Dr Denis growing confused respect
The doctor is aware that Rantés has been leaving without permission and has avoided taking his medicine but he is impressed and he takes Rantés requests seriously persuading the head of pathology Dr Prieto to hire him as a volunteer assistant
Prieto admits that Rantés would be his first assistant in some time
Surprising everyone Rantés is visited by an attractive young lady Beatriz
She and Rantés clearly know each other and Dr Denis hopes she can shed light on his mysterious patient s identity
Dr Denis introduces himself to Beatriz and it s obvious he is attracted to her
She tells Denis of Rantés work among children in a slum where they met while working for a Evangelical mission and especially his devotion to a young child with superior musical abilities beyond that she knows him as a very good man whom she is only casually acquainted with
Dr Denis is charmed by the woman and asks Rantés about her
He responds that she is very special and a Saint
Dr Denis invites both of them to an outdoor classical concert
During the concert captivated by the music Rantés asks Beatriz to dance
The audience finds this amusing and exciting and some of them decide to follow suit and also dance
Rantés becomes even more entranced by the Music as the orchestra plays Beethoven s Ninth Symphony
He eventually persuades the conductor to let him take the baton for the symphony s iconic Ode to Joy which confuses the Musicians leading to their refusing to play with him
After a few false starts with Rantés trying to conduct the Orchestra the musicians eventually decide to play as Rantés conducts them
The Audience is even more amused and excited by the situation while concurrently at the Asylum the Patients start to get excited and agitated and then parade the ground in a state of joy and eventually into the town where the concert is being held
The Police arrive and are about to remove Rantés from the conducting podium when the actual conductor convinces them to not remove Rantés
Rantés finishes and is arrested
Confronted by an angry hospital director Dr Denis is less concerned for his job than he is for his impetuous friend whom the director orders closely monitored and strictly medicated
Dr Denis fears this could kill Rantés unique personality and intellect
The director is unsympathetic and states Instead of making the police blotter Rantés ends up in the front page next time LUNATIC ORDERS MILITARY ATTACK
to which Denis quickly retorts That already happened and I doubt Rantés had anything to do with it
Affected by the medication Rantés broods and becomes rebellious
He seems tormented by Dr Denis lack of involvement asking Doctor why have you abandoned me
He is also more upset by the mistreatment of other patients
After escaping again he demands to see the director about the awful quality of the asylum s food but is turned away
His complaints are also rejected by the local newspaper
Dr Denis believes that Rantés is disillusioned with mankind and may never recover but continues the treatment
Dr Denis convinces Beatriz to meet at his home and they become passionate about each other and have sex
Then she confides to the Doctor that she is an alien projection like Rantés but who now feels emotion and can love him
Dr Denis is livid and throws her out of his home saying she is a lunatic like Rantés
After Rantés starts becoming catatonic the director decides to give him Electroshock treatment without notyfing Denis
Rantés doesn t endure anesthesia and dies after a heart attack
The rest of the patients don t believe in Rantés death as they all hope that he has only gone back to his ship for some time
From then on the patients keep waiting for Rantés to return and take them away to his planet
At the same time Denis quietly waits for Beatriz who is away indefinitely to return to him

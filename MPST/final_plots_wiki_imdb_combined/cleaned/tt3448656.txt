Indonesian special tactics officer Rama prays practices Silat and bids goodbye to his father and wife who is pregnant with his child
He cryptically promises his father he ll bring him home
Rama joins a heavily armed 20 man elite police squad including officers Bowo and Dagu Sergeant Jaka and Lieutenant Wahyu for a raid on a high rise apartment block in Jakarta s slums
The team intends to capture crime lord Tama Riyadi who along with his two lieutenants Andi and Mad Dog owns the block letting criminals and junkies around the city rent rooms under his protection
Arriving undetected the team sweeps the first floors and subdues various criminal tenants they also temporarily detain an innocent law abiding tenant delivering medicine to his sick wife in apartment 726
Continuing undetected to the sixth floor the team is spotted by a young lookout who passes on the message to another lookout just before he is shot dead by Lt Wahyu the latter youth raises the alarm
Tama calls reinforcements and the team is brutally attacked
Thugs snipe two officers guarding the perimeter eliminate two more in the armoured van and ambush several officers patrolling the first five floors
Cutting the lights Tama announces over the PA system that the police are trapped on the sixth floor stairwell and he will grant free permanent residence to those who kill the intruders
In the darkness the remaining team members are ambushed by shooters from above and almost completely wiped out
Prior to the gunfight Lt Wahyu confesses to Jaka he staged the mission so he can eliminate Tama who s in league with corrupt police officials including himself
The mission is not officially sanctioned by the police command nobody at HQ knows their location and thus there is no hope for reinforcements
The remaining officers retreat to an empty apartment as they are cornered by more armed thugs
To create an escape route Rama uses an axe to cut a hole in the wooden floor so the team can descend to the lower level
Dropping to the room below the team struggles to fend off Tama s horde of thugs and Officer Bowo is critically injured in the process
In a last ditch effort to defend his team Rama uses a stove propane tank to construct an improvised explosive device that successfully eliminates the invading henchmen giving the officers a small window of time
Out of ammunition and with more of Tama s reinforcements approaching the team splits into two groups Jaka Dagu and Lt Wahyu retreat to the fifth floor while Rama and a critically injured Bowo ascend back above in search of the law abiding tenant they encountered earlier
Fighting through a handful of goons on their way to apartment 726 Rama and Bowo plead with the tenant for help despite his sick wife s protest Gofar reluctantly hides the officers in his apartment
Four machete wielding thugs arrive and ransack the man s apartment
The leader noticing a refurbished wall begins stabbing it but fail to find Rama and Bowo
After tending to Bowo s wounds Rama leaves him with the couple while he searches for Jaka s group
On the eight floor he crosses paths with the machete gang but manages to defeat the group including their leader whom he uses to smash through a window and cushion a three story plummet onto a fire escape below
Exhausted he makes his way to the sixth floor before being unexpectedly grabbed by Andi who had just murdered two of Tama s men in the elevator
Andi is revealed to be his estranged brother and Rama signed up for the mission to search for him at the urging of their father
Rama refuses to leave the building without his comrades and Andi refuses to abandon his auspicious criminal life Just because you see what I do as wrong doesn t mean I can t be good at it
Rama reluctantly accepts and parts to search for his surviving team members
Meanwhile Mad Dog and a squad of his thugs discover where Jaka and his group are hiding
A brief scuffle ensues which ends up splitting the team even further the thugs pursue Lt Wahyu and Dagu while Jaka is left at Mad Dog s gunpoint
Instead of shooting him Mad Dog challenges Jaka to a hand to hand fight which he ultimately wins and proceeds to snap Jaka s neck killing him
Mad Dog meets up with Andi to report back to Tama in the surveillance room
Tama having learned of Andi s treachery incapacitates Andi and hands him over to Mad Dog for torture and execution
Rama regroups with Dagu and Lt Wahyu who go on to fight through a narcotics lab as they head for Tama on the 15th floor
Along the way Rama discovers the room where Mad Dog is torturing Andi causing him to separate from Dagu and Wahyu
Mad Dog lets Rama free Andi and fights both brothers
Mad Dog initially has the upper hand but the brothers prove to be a match when working together
Following an intense and grueling battle Rama kills Mad Dog with Andi s help
Meanwhile Lt Wahyu and Dagu confront Tama after killing off his remaining henchman
However Lt Wahyu ends up betraying Dagu by shooting him dead before taking Tama hostage intending to use him as a shield to escape
When the duo encounter Rama and Andi as they re leaving the building Tama taunts Lt Wahyu by revealing that he had already been waiting for them before the raid began and Lt Wahyu was set up by his corrupt higher ups indicating that he will be killed regardless of escaping
In despair Lt Wahyu kills Tama and attempts suicide only to find he has no ammunition left
Andi uses his influence over the tenants to allow Rama to leave with the injured Bowo and a detained Lt Wahyu
The tenant who protected Bowo watches from a window grinning with relief
Andi also hands over numerous blackmail recordings Tama made of corrupt officials taking bribes hoping Rama can use them to his benefit
Rama asks Andi to come home but Andi refuses due to his acclimation to his criminal lifestyle
Andi asserts he can protect Rama in his role as a gang lord but that Rama can t do the same for him
As he turns around and walks back to the apartment block with a grin Rama along with Lt Wahyu and an injured Bowo exits to an uncertain future

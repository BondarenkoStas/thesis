Preppy pre freshman Tom Lawrence visits PCU a college where fraternities have been outlawed and political correctness is rampant on campus
During his visit accident prone Tom manages to make enemies with nearly every group of students and thus spends much of his visit evading the growing mob upset with him
During his visit Tom also finds himself in the middle of a war between The Pit and Balls and Shaft two rival groups
Among the members of the latter is Rand McPherson who with the other Balls and Shaft members want the outlawed Greek system to return
Meanwhile The Pit an unofficial group runs the former Balls and Shaft frat house in a highly disorganized manner
Currently inhabited by seniors Gutter and Mullaney mid year Freshman co ed Katy and led by multi year senior James Droz Andrews The Pit is a party centric house that rebels against the politically correct protests their counter protests and parties are a frequent source of complaint forms
Other factions on campus include a commune style house of pot users called Jerrytown that Gutter often frequents a radical feminist group known as the Womynists an Afrocentrist group suspecting the Pit of conspiring against them and the college president Ms Garcia Thompson who is obsessed with enforcing sensitivity awareness and multiculturalism to an extreme
She proposes that Bisexual Asian Studies should have its own building as well as a plan to change the campus mascot to a Whooping Crane instead of an offensive Native American character during their Bicentennial Anniversary
Garcia Thompson conspires behind closed doors with Balls and Shaft to get the established residents of The Pit kicked off campus and give Rand control of the house
She provokes the Pit residents with a damage bill from their past semester
Left unpaid the campus would seize their house leaving them homeless and unable to continue attendance at PCU without getting jobs
The Pit responds by throwing a party to raise the funds needed
The Womynists take offense to The Pit s flyers advertising the party and hold a protest outside as the house residents conspire to steal alcohol and convince students to attend
The party at first appears to be a failure
However a series of unlikely events results in George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic performing at the party
Students begin streaming in and the party successfully raises the funds to keep the house
Garcia Thompson deciding to act on the many complaints against The Pit shuts down the party and expels the residents of The Pit in spite of their fundraising efforts
Tom then informs Droz about an overheard conversation with the Board of Trustees the President s politically correct changes are negatively affecting both their past legacy and media publicity
At the bicentennial ceremony the following morning Droz and former Pit residents succeed in liberating the Whooping Crane and provoking the other students into an impromptu protest against protesting
The demonstration establishes that even with The Pit shut down the President cannot control the student population resulting in the Board of Trustees summarily firing her
Meanwhile Rand complains about all the other student groups unaware that Droz has surreptitiously used the podium microphone to broadcast his rant to the entire campus
Later Tom heads home having decided to commit to PCU as the Pit has moved back into their house
As he sits on the bus he sees Rand who is now in Tom s position at the beginning of the film being chased by the students across campus

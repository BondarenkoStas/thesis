The episode begins in November 1648
King Charles I of England Scotland and Ireland has already lost the Civil War
Only two men remain loyal to him Sir Edmund Blackadder the sole descendant of the Blackadder dynasty at the time and his servant Baldrick Esq
They have given refuge to the King in Blackadder Hall where he is hiding in a thorn bush having assured him that he is as likely to be caught as a fox being chased by a pack of one legged hunting tortoises
Sir Edmund remains loyal because as a known royalist he sees the King s survival as his only hope of survival
He also fears the spread of Puritanism full of moral prohibitions
During Sir Edmund s short absence Oliver Cromwell himself arrives at Blackadder Hall accompanied by a number of his Roundheads supporters of the Parliament of England
Baldrick attempts to deny knowing the King s whereabouts but blows the gaff when he asks Cromwell later to put down a cup because it s the king s
The second scene takes place in the Tower of London two weeks later
King Charles s prayers are interrupted by two subsequent visits
The first is from Cromwell who warns him of his doom and the second by Sir Edmund disguised as a priest
He informs the King that he is planning the King s escape
While Sir Edmund is still there the King receives a notice that he has been sentenced to death
As 29 January 1649 arrives and his execution approaches King Charles is again visited by Sir Edmund
Though his plans for an escape have not materialised he informs the King that there is still some hope
The Parliament has yet to find a man willing to be the King s executioner
Charles rather philosophically proclaims that he isn t looking forward to his execution but It s a question of balance isn t it
Like so many other things
Sir Edmund proceeds to assure Charles that no one would dare to become the King s executioner
Just as he says that the King receives a notice that they found his executioner
Back at Blackadder Hall Baldrick is singing happily as Sir Edmund proclaims his life to be in ruins
While Baldrick informs him that he has accepted a job Sir Edmund wonders who could be so utterly without heart and soul so low and degraded as to behead the King of England
As his own words sink in he questions Baldrick who admits that it was he who accepted the position
Baldrick explains to the understandably enraged Blackadder that he has a cunning plan to save the King
He presents Sir Edmund with a huge pumpkin poorly painted to represent a human face
He plans to place it on the King s head and chop it instead
Sir Edmund dismisses the plan as Baldrick will have to hold the monarch s head in front of the crowd and criticises Baldrick s stupidity
Baldrick though saddened says that at least the money 1000 is good
At this Sir Edmund s greed awakens and he proceeds to take the money from Baldrick announcing that he will replace him as the executioner saying it needs somebody who actually has an axe
30 January 1649 King Charles day of execution arrives
King Charles is left alone for a few minutes with his executioner
Sir Edmund takes advantage of these minutes to relieve the King of his remaining wealth however the King eventually recognises him but mistakes Blackadder s intentions and congratulates him for trying to save him even at the last minute before giving him custody of his infant son the later King Charles II of England Scotland and Ireland
As he cannot explain his betrayal to the King Sir Edmund panics and uses the plan that Baldrick had suggested earlier
The camera then focuses on Baldrick who is listening to the sounds of the execution
Sir Edmund chops the pumpkin and proclaims that This is the head of a traitor
Predictably enough the crowd answers him No it s not
It s a huge pumpkin with a pathetic moustache drawn on it
Sir Edmund apologises and says he will try again
Baldrick continues to listen as Sir Edmund Blackadder beheads King Charles I and the crowd cheers
As the last scene begins Sir Edmund and Baldrick have returned to Blackadder Hall
A disgusted Blackadder cradles the infant Charles in his hands
Baldrick tries to console him by saying that at least he tried and that now the future of the British monarchy lies fast asleep in his arms in the person of this infant prince
He suggests to his master that he should be ready to escape to France because as a known Royalist he is in danger of being arrested by the Roundheads and beheaded
Sir Edmund who apparently had forgotten that he is in danger immediately rises from his seat ready to take action
But it is too late Roundheads are already at the Hall s doors demanding his surrender
Sir Edmund explains to Baldrick that there is no choice for a man of honour but to stand and fight and die in defence of his future sovereign
However as a Blackadder he was never a man of honour
Passing the prince to Baldrick he proceeds to remove his long black hair his false moustache and beard to reveal a Roundhead appearance short blond hair and a clean shaven face
Thus unrecognisable when Cromwell enters the room he denounces Baldrick as royalist scum
The episode ends with a hapless Baldrick still holding the Prince in his arms being approached by Cromwell sword drawn

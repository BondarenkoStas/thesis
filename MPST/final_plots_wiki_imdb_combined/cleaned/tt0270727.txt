The game s story is set in the bedroom of the player presumably a child
Jiminy Cricket is the guardian of a book in the player s room which features several stories with happy endings
However the book s happy ending pages are ripped out by a very bored Jiminy Cricket who has read them so often that they put him to sleep
As a game he asks the player to put them back where they belong when suddenly the book is possessed by the spirits of several Disney Villains namely Captain Hook from Peter Pan The Witch from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs The Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland and the Ringmaster from Dumbo who alter the stories to their advantage without the presence of happy endings
The Blue Fairy appears and explains that because stories live on in the hearts of readers by removing the happy endings left the stories at their climax with the heroes in peril and the villains in control
Jiminy and the player venture into the worlds of the stories to correct the happy endings
In the altered stories the Wicked Queen Grimhilde as Old Hag Witch has built a giant house resembling her infamous poisoned apple and has put Snow White to sleep and intends to do the same to the seven dwarves and the player must use the spellbook to free the Prince whom she trapped by magic so that the Prince kisses Snow White to wake her up the Ringmaster forces a now flightless Dumbo to endlessly perform humiliating stunts in his circus and the player must help Dumbo fly again by make the circus contraption perfect so that they can force the clown to perform the humiliating stunts the Queen of Hearts has rather violently had Alice decapitated although the girl does remain alive despite the separation of her body and head and the player must find Alice s head to piece her back together so that the White Rabbit must lead them home and Peter Pan is an old man which makes it too hard for him to fight Hook and the player must pick up Elderly Peter s sword to win the swashbuckling sword fight against Hook and his pirate crew so that the Crocodile can chase him away and Peter turns back into a young boy again
The villains steal the happy ending pages changing the bedroom into a battlefield mixed with their four areas
The player uses the book as a shield to deflect the villains attacks and defeats each one
All of the happy endings are restored at the end of the game

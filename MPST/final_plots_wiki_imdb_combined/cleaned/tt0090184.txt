Laure is a 10 year old girl whose family moves to a new address in Paris
One day Laure sees a group of boys playing outside the window and goes to play with them but they disappear quickly
Instead Laure meets Lisa a neighborhood girl
Lisa assumes that Laure is a boy and asks for his name
After a moment s thought Laure introduces herself as Mikäel
Lisa then introduces Mikäel to the rest of the neighborhood children stating that he is the new kid in the apartment complex
A bath scene in the film reveals that Mikäel has a vulva and a following scene confirms that her mother addresses her and her sister as girls
Mikäel becomes friends with Lisa and the boys and tries to hide her genitalia to appear like a boy
At one point this leads Mikäel to pee her pants which originally makes her embarrassed but is soon forgotten
As they all play Lisa and Mikäel develop crushes on each other and after swimming one day Lisa kisses her
At this point Mikäel also seems to be accepted into the group of boys
One day when Lisa comes by the apartment to look for Mikäel she runs into Mikäel s younger five year old sister Jeanne instead thereby revealing to Jeanne how Mikäel is presenting herself to her friends as a boy
At first Jeanne is upset but when Mikäel promises to take her with her on all her outings for the rest of the summer she quickly becomes happy to have a big brother which she says is way better than having a big sister
She also helps Mikäel cut her hair and keeps her secret from their parents
Although her mom is supportive of Mikäel being tomboy she also seems to want her to display more culturally defined female behaviors
Then after a fight with one of the boys the boy and his mother come to Mikäel s door to get her in trouble
Mikäel s mother pretends to know that Mikäel is her son but afterwards she gets angry with her for telling everyone that she was a boy
After this incident Mikäel s mother forces her to wear a blue girl s dress and makes her go over to the apartment of the boy she hit
Jeanne is visibly upset by this and tries to help Mikäel
Mikäel s mother is also clearly upset and sad about the situation
She confesses to Mikäel that she is forcing her to reveal that she is a girl to protect him
Mikäel s mom also makes her go to Lisa s apartment
When Lisa sees Mikäel in a dress she runs off without a word
Mikäel also runs away to the woods
After a time alone she takes off the blue dress leaving her in a boyish tanktop
Walking away from the discarded dress Mikäel sees the other children in the distance
She can hear them talking about him and speculating if she is really a girl
When they spot her they chase her and surround him saying they re going to see if she s really a girl
Lisa stands up to them and tells them to leave her alone
Once she is called disgusting for kissing a girl however Lisa reluctantly checks and confirms Mikäel s genitalia
They leave Mikäel alone in the woods in despair
Later we see Mikäel in her house with her mom younger sister and new born baby brother not wanting to go outside
But when she sees Lisa standing waiting outside her window she goes out to meet her
She asks her quietly what her name is
She says she is called Laure
She starts to smile
This final scene suggests hope for at least a friendship between her and Lisa

Story Prologue Tanker chapter The game opens with a flashback two years after the Shadow Moses incident in the original Metal Gear Solid
On August 8 2007 Solid Snake and Otacon now members of the non governmental organization Philanthropy are investigating the development of a new Metal Gear by the United States Marine Corps
Snake arrives on the tanker transporting the weapon in the middle of an attack by Russian mercenaries led by Colonel Gurlukovich his daughter Olga and Snake s enemy Ocelot who has transplanted the right arm of Liquid Snake following the loss of his own in Metal Gear Solid
After Snake knocks Olga unconscious he sneaks down to the hold in order to record pictures of the new Metal Gear RAY
As the mercenaries take control below Ocelot betrays his allies and shoots both Colonel Gurlukovich and the Marine commander
Just before Ocelot can commandeer Metal Gear RAY Snake emerges and confronts him
Upon seeing Snake Ocelot becomes possessed by Liquid Snake and escapes with RAY leaving the ship to sink
In the aftermath Snake is blamed for the disaster and is believed to have perished
The Big Shell clean up facility is later constructed ostensibly to help clean the Hudson River after the major oil spill that occurred due to the tanker sinking
Plant chapter On April 29 2009 Raiden is tasked under a reformed FOXHOUND
He has orders to infiltrate the Big Shell to rescue hostages including the US president from the terrorist group Sons of Liberty backed up by the rogue anti terror training unit Dead Cell who are also threatening to destroy the facility
All members of SEAL Team 10 are killed by Dead Cell members Vamp and Fortune and the Big Shell is patrolled by the surviving Russian mercenaries from the Tanker chapter led now by Olga who is unaware of the extent of Ocelot s betrayal and believes Snake was responsible for her father s murder
The remaining members of the SEAL assault team Iroquois Pliskin and Peter Stillman join Raiden to disable explosives planted on the Shell by Stillman s former pupil Fatman now a terrorist
Stillman is killed by Fatman s booby trap in Shell 2 though he manages to warn Raiden in time who successfully disables the respective bomb in Shell 1 preventing the sinking of the facility
Raiden then survives a direct confrontation with Fortune and Vamp and kills Fatman on the heliport
As Raiden searches for the President he begins to doubt Pliskin s identity but agrees to the plan of transporting hostages off the Big Shell with a helicopter
However they are attacked by the leader of the Sons of Liberty who identifies himself as Solid Snake
Pliskin however shouts that the man is not Snake and assists Raiden in fending off the leader when he attacks with a Harrier Jet piloted by Vamp
The battle ends with the Harrier being shot down though it is seized by the Metal Gear RAY seen in the Tanker chapter and the two terrorists escape
Pliskin reveals himself to be the real Solid Snake who along with Otacon helps Raiden locate the President
When Raiden finally contacts President Johnson he is informed that the Big Shell is a facade to hide a new Metal Gear
Known as Arsenal Gear it houses a powerful AI called GW which is capable of controlling the transmission of digital information
The President also claims that the democratic process is a sham and the true rulers of the United States are a secret organization called the Patriots
The President then reveals the leader of the Sons of Liberty is his predecessor George Sears a perfect clone of Big Boss known as Solidus Snake who fell out of the Patriots favor following Shadow Moses and has now gone rogue with Dead Cell to escape the Patriots control
Ocelot kills the President soon after this revelation
Raiden moves on to disabling Arsenal Gear going to rescue an engineer Emma Emmerich
After fighting Vamp who seemingly drowns after being shot Raiden rescues Emma who agrees to help upload a virus into the GW mainframe
However the upload is halted partway when Emma is attacked by Vamp
Raiden then defeats Vamp by shooting him again although the injuries Emma suffers prove fatal
Otacon escapes with the surviving hostages while Raiden is captured by Olga when Solid Snake seemingly betrays him
Raiden awakens in a torture chamber where Solidus Snake reveals that he once adopted Raiden a former child soldier as his son during the Liberian civil war and that Raiden is now a Patriot agent
Solidus then leaves the chamber and Olga steps in and frees Raiden telling him that she is also a Patriot double agent and that she was blackmailed to aid Raiden in order to protect her child
Olga also tells Raiden to find Solid Snake who only allowed Raiden to be captured so he could gain access to Arsenal Gear
While Raiden makes his way through the bowels of the facility to rendezvous with Snake his commanding officer the Colonel begins to act very erratically
Upon investigation Otacon reveals that the Colonel is actually a construct of the GW supercomputer and that the partially uploaded virus is beginning to damage its systems
Raiden receives a call from Rose whose voice begins to deepen and slow down as the conversation is cut off but not before she reveals she is pregnant with his child
Raiden reunites with Snake and his gear and the two then encounter Fortune who fights Snake while Raiden searches for Solidus
He is then forced into a battle with twenty five Metal Gear RAY units in Arsenal Gear
Olga protects him before Solidus kills her and captures Snake and Raiden
Ocelot reveals that he too is a Patriot agent and that the entire Big Shell mission was a carefully coordinated attempt to reenact the events of the Shadow Moses incident for the purpose of creating a soldier on par with Solid Snake
Ocelot kills Fortune before being possessed by Liquid again who announces his plan to hunt down the Patriots using his host s knowledge and the first Metal Gear RAY
Snake escapes to pursue Liquid as Arsenal Gear goes out of control
The next morning on April 30 2009 Arsenal crashes into downtown Manhattan launching Raiden and Solidus onto the roof of Federal Hall National Memorial
Solidus attempts to kill Raiden intending to use his nanomachines to lead him to the Patriots eliminate them and form a nation of Sons of Liberty
At this point Raiden is contacted by AI s of the Colonel and Rosemary introducing themselves as representatives of the Patriots who reveal that the true purpose of the simulation was to see how they could simulate and control human behavior in order to prevent society from dumbing down due to trivial information drowning valuable knowledge and inconvenient truths

After Solidus s defeat Snake reveals he planted a tracking device on Liquid s Metal Gear
Snake and Otacon plan to follow him rescue Olga s child and hunt down the Patriots whose details were hidden in the GW computer virus disc

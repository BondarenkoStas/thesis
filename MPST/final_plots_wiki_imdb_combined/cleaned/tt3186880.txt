Setting The Wolf Among Us is set in the year 1986 nearly twenty years before the events of Fables
For years many of the magical lands described in myth legend and folklore have been occupied by an enigmatic tyrant known as the Adversary
To escape the Adversary s totalitarian regime many of The Homelands inhabitants fled to colonial America and created an enclave known as Fabletown now located in modern day Manhattan
To mask their presence from the native humans all non human fables have to purchase an enchantment known as a glamour which allows them to appear human or be relocated to a rural community known as The Farm

Bigby Wolf formerly the Big Bad Wolf is the Sheriff of Fabletown a hidden community of fairytale characters located in 1980s New York City
Receiving a call from Mr Toad Bigby manages to save a prostitute from an intoxicated Woodsman
He escorts her to safety and before she departs she tells him he is not as bad as everyone says he is
Later that night Bigby is shocked to find the woman s head left on the Woodlands doorstep
Clues left with the head identify her as Faith a Fable from Allerleirauh
Deputy Mayor Ichabod Crane orders him and Snow White to investigate her death
They head to the apartment she shared with her husband Prince Lawrence and find the Tweedles Dee and Dum snooping through it
They learn from Lawrence that they struggled to make ends meet and Faith took up prostitution to help pay the bills
Bigby leaves Snow at the Woodlands while he continues to trace leads
When he returns he finds the Woodlands surrounded by police Snow s head sitting on the building s steps
Bigby is taken in for questioning but Crane uses a spell to wipe the incident from the police s minds
When they return they are surprised to find Snow still alive the head is shown to be disguised by a black market glamour a spell that Fables use to look human and belongs to a troll named Lily
Bigby tracks Lily s connections to a strip club run by Georgie Porgie but Georgie claims innocence
One of his other prostitutes Nerissa cryptically directs Bigby to a nearby hotel room
There he finds Lily s blood on the bed and photographic evidence of Crane engaging in sexual acts with Lily glamoured to look like Snow
He informs Snow of this and they race back to the Woodlands to find Crane gone and the Magic Mirror which could have revealed his location shattered with one shard missing
Bigby follows a trail of clues to Crane s whereabouts to the apartment of Aunty Greenleaf one of the witches that makes the black market glamours
Along the way Bigby discovers that Crane has been embezzling money from Fabletown over the years to pay off a loan shark known as the Crooked Man
When Bigby and Snow threaten to destroy the tree she needs to make them Greenleaf begs forgiveness and points the two back to Georgie s club
Storming the club they find Crane trying to hide in the back
Snow realizes Crane s actions are not that of a murderer and the two convince Crane to return for questioning
En route they are stopped by the Crooked Man and his agents the Tweedles and Bloody Mary
Mary and the Tweedles goad Bigby into his werewolf form and a fight breaks out
When Mary wounds Bigby with a silver bullet Snow steps in to stop the fight and willingly gives up Crane
Back at Woodlands Bigby is healed and is struggling to find clues when Nerissa appears
He realizes the ribbon she wears prevents her from speaking the truth that Faith wore an identical ribbon and that Faith died when the ribbon was removed
He follows another trail of clues and finds evidence of the black market glamour ring in the Cut Above butcher shop a pawn shop called the Lucky Pawn where the Crooked Man distributes his loans to Fables owned by Jersey Devil another henchman of the Crooked Man and Crane s presence as well as the missing Mirror shard
The Mirror reveals Mary putting Crane onto an overseas flight to keep him from talking as well as the next location of the door to the Crooked Man s realm which moves around the city
Bigby enters the Crooked Man s realm alone meeting him and his agents
The Crooked Man explains that the situation is all a misunderstanding by Georgie who had only been asked to deal with an internal problem but Georgie asserts the Crooked Man told him to kill the women
A fight ensues and ends with the Crooked Man escaping and a fatally slashed Georgie fleeing with Vivian
When Bigby tracks Vivian to the Club she explains that the Crooked Man and Georgie were acting to stop a plot spearheaded by Faith with the other prostitutes
Vivian is revealed to be the girl with the ribbon around her neck and having made copies of her ribbon trapped women like Faith Lily and Nerissa for Georgie whilst guaranteeing their silence
Regretting her actions Vivian undoes her ribbon breaking the spell but severing her head
Bigby then finds the Crooked Man s hideout and corners him in an office where he demands a fair trial at the Woodlands
Bigby returns to the Witching Well at the Business Office to recount events to the assembled Fables of Woodlands where he and Snow are forced to defend their actions against claims from the Fables
Bigby recounts Vivian s and Georgie s confessions regarding the Crooked Man s involvement but his word is deemed untrustworthy
Nerissa appears and testifies that she and five other women heard the Crooked Man order the murders
Their testimonies are considered sufficient to believe what Bigby did was right
In the epilogue Snow and Bluebeard deal with the fallout of the Crooked Man s actions while Bigby sees off those Fables being taken back to the Farm
Afterward he encounters Nerissa who is moving on with her life
She admits that Faith concocted a plan with Lily Nerissa and the other prostitutes to blackmail Georgie and the Crooked Man for their freedom using a picture of Lily and Crane together but Georgie killed Faith when he discovered their plot
Nerissa left Faith s head at the Woodlands to get Bigby involved and gave false testimony to have the Crooked Man punished knowing that he was the one who ordered their deaths
Leaving she comments Bigby is not as bad everyone says he is causing Bigby to recall Faith said the same before her death
Several past conversations with Faith and Nerissa regarding the use of glamours play out in Bigby s head leading him to question the true identity of Nerissa

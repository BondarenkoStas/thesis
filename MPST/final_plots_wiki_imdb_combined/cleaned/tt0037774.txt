The cartoon opens with a faux Walter Winchell like voice discussing the end of the Third Reich saying that Germany has been battered into a fare thee well and musing about where the high leadership and Fatso Göring in particular has gone
The scene soon cuts to the Black Forest where Hermann Göring in bemedalled lederhosen is soothing his jangled nerves marching while on a hunt
Nearby a familiar furrow in the ground appears with a hole at the end
Bugs pops out of the hole and sees no sign of the Black Forest on his map made dat left toin at Albakoikie
Bugs asks Göring about the directions to Las Vegas oblivious to his location
Göring is almost tricked into going to Las Vegas but then quickly realizes Las Veegas
Why there is no Las Veegas in Germany
before he fires his musket at Bugs
Genuinely alarmed by his mistaken destination Bugs hightails it
Göring chases after the rabbit trying to suck Bugs out of his hole with his musket as a plunger
A few chase gags go by in which Bugs insults the integrity of Göring s medals by bending one with his teeth
Suckered into bending one himself Göring declares them ersatz and mumbles all sorts of anti Hitler sentiments
Bugs masquerades as Adolf Hitler using a bit of mud and faces the surprised Göring
Göring disappears off screen in a flash to change into his Nazi uniform adorned with all sorts of medals
After the usual Nazi salute Bugs berates him in faux German as he rips all of the medals off Göring s uniform quickly followed by his belt
Göring kisses in reverence saying Look
I kiss mein Führer s hand
I kiss right in der Führer s face

Afterwards Göring exclaims Oh I m a bad flooten boy glooten
a variant on Warner Bros cartoons frequently cited Lou Costello type catchphrase I m a bad boy
Later when the jig is up Bugs rides in on a white horse dressed as Brünhilde from Wagnerian opera to the tune of the Pilgrims Chorus from Tannhäuser
Entranced Göring responds by dressing up as Siegfried
The two dance before Bugs once again makes a fool of Göring and escapes
Eventually Göring gets a hawk to capture Bugs
Bugs standing next to Göring asks Do you think he ll catch me doc
to which Göring replies Do I think he ll catch you
Why he ll have you back here before you can say Schicklgruber
Bugs runs off and jumps into his rabbit hole but as he falls down the hole the hawk which imitates Jimmy Durante catches Bugs in a bag capturing him
Göring brings the bag to Hitler who plays solitaire in front of a map depicting the decline of Fortress Europe
Göring identifies the captive in the bag as Bugsenheimer Bunny to der Führer
As Herr Hitler talks of the great rewards he s going to pile upon Göring for this act of heroism he peeks inside the bag and is shocked
Göring goes and looks inside the bag as well to be shocked as well
Out of the bag comes Bugs dressed as Joseph Stalin complete with an enormous pipe and a large moustache staring back at them
As the cartoon ends Bugs glances back at the camera and asks in a Russian accent Does your tobacco taste different lately
citing an ad slogan of that era for the Sir Walter Raleigh pipe tobacco manufactured by the Brown Williamson Tobacco Company

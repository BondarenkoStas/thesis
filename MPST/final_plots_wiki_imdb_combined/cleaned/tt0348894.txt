All of the rules are adopted from the rules of The Bachelor its parent show
The series revolves around a single bachelorette who is usually a reject from the previous Bachelor season and a pool of romantic interests which could include a potential husband for the bachelorette
Season 11 was the first season to feature a twist in casting
Since producers could not decide between The Bachelor Season 19 contenders Kaitlyn Bristowe and Britt Nilsson
The 25 men participating had to decide which bachelorette would make the best wife
In the end more men voted for Kaitlyn and Britt was sent home on the first night
For the final selection one of two male suitors proposes to the bachelorette
All eleven seasons of The Bachelorette have ended with a proposal which the Bachelorette either accepted or declined
This differs from The Bachelor who does not always propose at the end of the show
At the end of Juan Pablo s season he decided to choose a girl to keep spending time with but evidently was not ready for a proposal
Trista Rehn s marriage to Ryan Sutter Ashley Hebert s marriage to JP Rosenbaum and Desiree Hartsock s marriage to Chris Siegfried have been the only marriages to result
The weddings of the former two were broadcast on ABC
Season 13 is the first to have an African American contestant as the bachelorette

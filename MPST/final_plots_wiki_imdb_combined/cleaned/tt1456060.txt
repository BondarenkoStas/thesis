A young boy named Sean Donovan lives with his mother and abusive alcoholic father
A carjacker attacks his family one night which results in his mother s murder
Afterward his father Terry moves them to a nicer neighborhood
Years later Sean is an excellent student but has become unsocial and he sees abuse in everyday arguments
He trains as a boxer and carries weapons at night as a vigilante
He kills an assaulter in an attempted mugging and an eyewitness account garners the attention of Teresa Ames who had recently been promoted to the homicide division of the NYPD
She investigates Sean who frequents the police station as he searches for information on his mother s killer
Teresa befriends him and learns about his life such as the fact that he speaks fluent Chinese after he angrily berates rude staff in a Chinese restaurant
Sean defends a young woman being violently abused by her pimp and strikes him with a baton before shooting him
While riding the train Sean encounters a homeless man verbally harassing a Chinese family and the passengers of the train
He tells the family to leave the car before putting on face paint and brutally beating the man with brass knuckles
Teresa and her partner who happen to be on the train investigate but Sean eludes them
Learning that the perpetrator spoke fluent Chinese she suspects Sean
Despite her supervisor s warning not to investigate Sean she persists
Finally the retired supervisor tells Teresa that the young Sean was able to clearly identify his mother s murderer from a photo book but Terry convinced him to withdraw his statement
The murderer s identity is identified as Larry Childs a contract killer whom Teresa arrested six months ago but managed to get a two year sentence through a plea bargain
As Sean walks down the street he sees scenes of domestic violence that apparently revert to gentle arguments after he passes by
During a school party Sean has an episodic memory recall where he remembers his mother s murderer call his father by his old boxing nickname
Enraged by the memory he savagely beats a fellow student who has been harassing a female friend
Teresa finds a picture of Terry and the murderer and realizes that they knew each other before the attack
Sean assumes that Terry staged the attack in order to get his mother s life insurance money
Sean confronts his father but Terry adamantly denies this
Convinced of his father s guilt Sean shoots and kills Terry
Teresa tracks down Sean who states someone broke into their home and killed his father and she disposes of the murder weapon
Sometime later Sean sends a letter to Larry who is currently serving his two year sentence
In the letter Sean expresses his forgiveness to Larry but pleads with him to reveal the truth of his mother s murder was his father involved
He puts an empty envelope a red stamp and a black stamp together with the letter and asks Larry to reply to him with a black stamp for his father s guilt or a red stamp for his father s innocence
The stamp Larry uses is poisoned with Tricelaron and kills him
When the letter arrives Sean stares at the red stamp on it

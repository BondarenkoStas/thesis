Christmas Tree Stephen his mother Myrna and his two sisters Hazel and Eunice planned to visit their Lola Susana during the Christmas Break
During the long journey Stephen has a dream concerning his deceased father Chuck He was running along a forest where he encounters his father s ghost who encouraged him to be brave for he is the only male member of his family
Chuck s ghost morphed suddenly into a zombie waking Stephen up and receiving teases from his little sister
Upon their arrival in Lola Susana s house Jong had already erected their new Christmas Tree
It was over eight feet tall
Hazel even hypothesized that it came from the Amazon rainforest where its kind were a rare species
A day before the Christmas Eve the family eagerly decorated it making it look elegant
However something eerie grips into the atmosphere
During a night stroll Stephen noticed Elton John Jong s parrot disappeared without a trace
Worse even Eunice s giraffe doll was found torn in pieces thus blaming the latter s brother
Even Yaya Sonny wonders why the Tree keeps getting tall
Christmas Eve descended finally
After a sumptuous Christmas feast the family was ready to sleep
However Yaya Sonny wanted to add a couple of Christmas balls
He noticed something strange within the leaves of the tree green feathers evidence that the tree supposedly ate Elton John
In a worse turn of fate Sonny was tragically eaten by the Tree itself
Things began to become tense
Stephen having heard of the commotions downstairs wakes his Ate Hazel to investigate
Jong then arrived to the scene next
The three witnessed the horrendous transformation of the Christmas Tree All those times there was a monstrous tree that came from the deepest corners of an unknown jungle dwelling within the leaves of the Tree itself
Before they could run Jong was knocked out by the monster
Thinking he was dead Hazel and Stephen raced to their mother s room narrating them that the Christmas Tree was truly alive
Myrna dismisses Stephen s story telling him there were no such things as monsters
Myrna was wrong Judging by the stomps heard in the stairs the Christmas Tree was now upstairs
She peered on the door only to find out that the monster tree was outside
Danger and tension prevailed over the next events
Myrna warned Lola Susana to stay in the room while Hazel and Stephen make a diversion tripping the Christmas Tree
Hazel and Stephen rushed to the kitchen while Lola Susana Myrna and Eunice escaped to the car
Hazel found something acid
Stephen also found his Uncle Jong unconscious on the floor
Acid will kill the tree
Stephen having experienced being a baseball player threw the bottles of acid missing the first two
At his third turn the acid went straight to the Tree s mouth killing it

As Marionne and Jerome realize this Florence cries and asks Jerome to wake up
Jerome tries his best but Marrione holds him down determined to spend the eternity with the man she love but does not love her back
Marionne eventually dies followed by a struggling Jerome

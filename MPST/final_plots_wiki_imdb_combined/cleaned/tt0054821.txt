Maurice Faugel just released from prison after serving a six year sentence meets a friend Gilbert who is appraising the value of jewels from a recent heist
Maurice is planning a robbery the next day with two accomplices Silien and Rémy
Maurice kills Gilbert with Gilbert s own gun and steals the jewels as well as a large sum of money
It is later revealed that Gilbert killed Maurice s girlfriend Arlette to keep her from informing the police when Maurice was sent to prison six years prior
Maurice leaves the house just as Nuttheccio and Armand prominent gangsters arrive to collect the loot
Maurice buries the jewels money and gun under a lamppost
Maurice spends the evening at his girlfriend Thérèse s apartment
Silien arrives the next day with Maurice s friend Jean to deliver equipment for the robbery that evening
When Silien leaves he uses a payphone to call Inspector Salignari
That evening Maurice and Rémy leave to rob a home in affluent Neuilly
Meanwhile Silien comes to Thérèse s apartment then beats her and ties her to a wall radiator demanding to know the address of the robbery
The police arrive at the robbery
Inspector Salignari corners Maurice and Rémy fatally shooting Rémy
Maurice and Salignari shoot at one another Maurice is hit in the shoulder and Salignari is killed
Maurice leaves the gun in Rémy s hand and continues to run away
He passes out just before a car pulls up to the curb
Maurice wakes up in Jean s apartment but neither Maurice nor Jean s wife Anita know who brought him there
Maurice resolves to find Silien who he believes informed the police
He leaves Anita with a diagram showing where he buried the jewels money and gun telling her to give it to Jean if something happens to him
Because the police know that Silien called Salignari they assume he has information on the botched robbery
They question him hoping to get the name of Rémy s accomplice but Silien tells them he wasn t the informant
He mentions that he hopes to get out of the criminal underworld and live in a house he has built in Ponthierry
It is revealed that the car that rescued Maurice has been found wrecked with Thérèse s body inside
The police also suspect Maurice for the murder of Gilbert
They threaten to falsely implicate Silien in a drug case unless he helps them find Maurice
Silien complies and Maurice is found
Maurice claims that Gilbert was killed while Maurice was in another room of the house
The police offer to let him go if he has information on the robbery in Neuilly but Maurice claims he has no information
He is jailed where he meets a prisoner named Kern
Silien finds the buried jewels money and gun beneath the lamppost
He visits Nuttheccio s club and speaks to Fabienne a former girlfriend
He offers to get her out of her relationship with Nuttheccio if she will testify that Nuttheccio and Armand killed Gilbert
She agrees
Silien kills Nuttheccio and plants the jewels in his safe while Fabienne calls Armand to tell him Nuttheccio has found the stolen jewels and wants to see him
When Armand arrives Silien kills him staging the scene to make it look like they killed one another
With Nuttheccio and Armand dead and framed for Gilbert s murder Maurice is released from prison
He still believes that Silien informed on him so Jean and Silien reveal that Silien was not the informant and had in fact been maneuvering to get Maurice out of prison
Though Silien was a friend of Salignari he did not inform him of the robbery
However he recognized Thérèse as one of Salignari s informants
The night of the robbery Silien called Salignari to invite him to dinner and Salignari revealed that he would be arresting two burglars in Neuilly
Silien got the address from Thérèse and went to Neuilly to avert a disaster
He arrived in time to pick up Maurice and take him to Jean s apartment
Silien announces that he will be moving in with Fabienne at his home in Ponthierry and that he is going there now
However while in prison Maurice arranged for his cellmate Kern to kill Silien promising the money he stole from Gilbert in exchange
Kern is waiting at Silien s home and Maurice rushes there to tell him that the hit is off
Maurice manages to arrive in Ponthierry before Silien but Kern shoots him apparently mistaking him for Silien
When Silien arrives he sees Maurice s body on the ground
With his dying breath Maurice warns him that someone is waiting behind a partition
Silien shoots at the screen killing Kern but Silien is also fatally shot

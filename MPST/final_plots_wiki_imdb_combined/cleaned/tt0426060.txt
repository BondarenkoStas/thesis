High school senior Daniel LaRusso and his mother Lucille move from Newark New Jersey to Reseda Los Angeles California
When they arrive Daniel meets a neighbor Freddy Fernandez who invites him to a beach party taking place the next day
Their maintenance man is an eccentric but kind and humble Okinawan immigrant Kesuke Miyagi
At the beach party Daniel meets Ali Mills a high school cheerleader from Encino
The two fall for each other which draws the attention of Johnny Lawrence Ali s ex boyfriend
Johnny is the top student of a karate dojo called Cobra Kai who attacks Daniel when he intervenes after Johnny breaks Ali s radio
Johnny and his gang continue to bully bother and harass him
At a Halloween party Daniel douses Johnny with water leading to a chase
Daniel is eventually caught and beaten savagely but Mr Miyagi arrives and rescues him and beats up the five attackers with ease
Amazed Daniel asks Miyagi to teach him to fight
Miyagi refuses but agrees to accompany Daniel to the Cobra Kai dojo to resolve the conflict
They meet with the sensei John Kreese an ex Special Forces Vietnam veteran who dismisses the peace offering and demands to set up a match between Daniel and the other Cobra Kai students
Miyagi proposes that Daniel will enter the Under 18 All Valley Karate Tournament where he can compete with all the Cobra Kai students and he requests that the bullying cease while Daniel trains
Kreese agrees to the terms but warns that if Daniel doesn t show up at the tournament the harassment will continue on Daniel and Miyagi
Daniel s training starts with menial chores he believes only makes him Miyagi s slave
When he becomes frustrated it is explained that these actions have helped him learn defensive blocks through muscle memory
Their bond develops and Daniel learns about Miyagi s dual loss of his wife and newborn son due to complications arising from childbirth at Manzanar internment camp while he was serving with the 442nd Infantry Regiment during World War II in Europe where he received the Medal of Honor the Army s highest award for valor
Through Miyagi s teaching Daniel learns not only karate but also important life lessons such as the importance of personal balance reflected in the principle that martial arts training is as much about training the spirit as the body
Daniel applies the life lessons that Miyagi taught him to strengthen his relationship with Ali
At the tournament Daniel unexpectedly reaches the semi finals
After Johnny defeats a highly skilled opponent Kreese instructs Bobby Brown one of his more compassionate students and the least vicious of Daniel s tormentors to disable Daniel with an illegal attack to the knee
Bobby reluctantly does so getting disqualified in the process
Daniel is taken to the locker room where the physician determines that he can t continue but Daniel believes that if he doesn t continue his tormentors would have gotten the best of him
So he convinces Miyagi to use a pain suppression technique so that he can continue
As Johnny is about to be declared the winner by default Ali tells the master of ceremonies that Daniel will fight
Daniel then hobbles into the ring and faces Johnny
The match is halted when Daniel uses a scissor leg technique to trip Johnny and deliver a blow to the back of the head giving him a nose bleed
Kreese orders Johnny to sweep Daniel s injured leg an unethical move
Johnny horrified at the order insists he can beat Daniel legitimately but obeys under Kreese s intimidation
As the match continues Johnny seizes Daniel s leg and delivers a vicious blow doing further damage
Daniel standing with difficulty assumes the Crane stance a technique he observed Miyagi performing on the beach
Johnny lunges toward Daniel who jumps and delivers a kick to Johnny s chin winning the tournament
Having gained respect towards his nemesis Johnny takes Daniel s trophy from the master of ceremonies and presents it to Daniel himself as Daniel is carried off by the enthusiastic crowd

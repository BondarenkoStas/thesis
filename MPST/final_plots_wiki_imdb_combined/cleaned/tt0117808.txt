In Warsaw a student only known as the Italian is on the search for an apartment
The Italian who is beautiful and a free spirit is originally from the countryside
During her search she meets anthropology professor Michał who is renting her an apartment that was occupied by his brother
The business is concluded by a violent sex scene between the two in the empty apartment
Michał is engaged with Anna an architect and daughter of his director
During excavations with his students and his younger colleague Juliuz he finds the well conserved body of a shaman more than two thousand years old
In the laboratory they study the mummified shaman who is covered in mystical tattoos and is found to have a pouch of hallucinogenic mushrooms
They try to determine the cause of the shaman s death which does not seem to be natural
The back of his skull has been crushed they theorise this was perhaps done to release his spirit after his death
The life of Michał is turned upside down by the discovery of the shaman s body and his increasingly obsessive love affair with the Italian
For the Italian he breaks with his fiancée Anna and his friends
He tries to tame the Italian but she resists his domination always unforeseeable and rebellious
In the laboratory the researchers consume the shaman s mushrooms and in a delirium attempt to bring him back to life
In a moment of illumination Michał speaks with the spirit of the shaman
He reveals to him that he was killed by a woman who wanted to capture his magic power
Michał who finally regards himself as free and lucid breaks up with the Italian
She bludgeons him to death crushing the back of his skull like the shaman s and eats his brain

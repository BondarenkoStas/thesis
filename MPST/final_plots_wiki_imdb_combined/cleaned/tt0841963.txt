Upon meeting Alviss he learns of the sinister Chess Pieces and how they had tried to take over MÄR Heaven six years earlier
Alviss reveals that he summoned Ginta in order to gain assistance from an other worlder in the upcoming war as was done previously and that Babbo originally belonged to one of the knights of the Chess Pieces
Gaining both allies and enemies the series follows Ginta as he opposes the Chess Pieces led by Chess Piece King Orb Queen Diana and her servant Phantom
MÄR Omega The story started 6 years after the second War Games about Kai the adoptive son of an ÄRM smith from Harnau City in MÄR Heaven who idolizes Ginta and Babbo for defeating Phantom at the end of the 2nd War Games
He always wants a good ÄRM for himself which is often ridiculed by others since Kai possesses no potential whatsoever of magic power much to his personal dislike since at the time throughout MÄR Heaven ÄRMs are already in wide use and Kai himself inherited a magic stone from his dead parents a memento highly suggested his family s relation to the sorcerer kingdom Kaldea
When Kai was delivering ÄRMs to another city he walked past a mountain and suddenly got attacked by a remnant of the Chess Pieces
While searching for cover from the Chess Pieces s wind Nature ÄRM Kai jumped into a pond and woke up the most unthinkable underwater resident Babbo
Using the ÄRM Kai defeated the Chess Piece one amazing yet inexplicable feat how was he a normal boy be able to fight with the ÄRM up til then wieldable to only two persons both warriors of legend Ginta and Phantom
Leaving the question hanging the two returned to Kai s city only to find themselves in an even tighter situation among those who came to admire Babbo there are Kai s fake ÄRM user friends and they were all out to take Babbo to bring it to a sinister mysterious figure who was watching them the whole time
When the emergency arose Kai had no choice but to resort to his last option put the magic stone he owned into Babbo and forth reborn to the world of MÄR Heaven the most powerful Guardian recognized Gargoyle
Gargoyle easily defeated the guardians and returned their owners consciousness but then it was Kai s turn to face trouble with his ÄRM he lost contact with Babbo inside Gargoyle and the monster would have ravaged the whole town if not for the timely restraint from Alviss with his familiar 13 Totem Poles attack allowing Kai enough time to regain synchronization with Babbo returning him to normal
Saving everyone no time to ponder on what had happened the Cross Guard s young warrior s unexpected arrival brought an even more unexpected truth those fake ÄRM all used so at their own ease didn t indeed require a proper amount of magic power from the users but it sucked from them a worse fuel their life energy and through that their minds could be controlled like a puppet dancing to death
It has not yet been revealed to why people used the fake ÄRMs or who made the fake ÄRM however as the one controlling everyone took a sudden desperate move to seal the town except Alviss Kai Babbo and Kai s female friend Elise introducing himself
Although he was easily defeated by Kai and Alviss the town couldn t be returned and for that they had to consult Kaldea birthplace of all ÄRMs and magic users
In Kaldea they were welcomed by Dorothy and a new male character named Inga into the Grand Elder s palace
All answers for their questions were ready coming down to a legend descending the magic kingdom for 300 years the fake ÄRMs were not actually the work of many sorcerers but rather only one s the dark magician with infamy for his experiments of human mind manipulation went by the name of Unwetter
Babbo the Elder of Kaldea in his time confronted the man and succeeded in consigning him and his malicious creations into oblivion just before Babbo himself died transferring his soul into the ÄRM and erasing every memory related to that accident
It s unknown for the Grand Elder himself however as to why the supposedly sealed fake ÄRMs were once again spread throughout MÄR Heaven now how the supposedly dead Unwetter could be revived and what purpose would be served with the claiming of Babbo
Either way until these riddles could be solved Babbo would be taken into custody which of course met with Kai s disagreement
Relented the wizard postponed the deal with Babbo only if Kai could prove himself worthy of wielding it inside Dorothy s training Dimension ÄRM with Inga s witness
They were not disappointed however as when facing with the danger of death Kai suddenly unleashed all his dormant magic power which was so powerful that it did not only confirm his relation to the magic kingdom but also suggested a direct blood connection to Babbo
No sooner had they discovered that than the fake ÄRM users presented themselves before Caldia to continue the accomplishment of their objective take Babbo back to their master Unwetter
Kai and crew are able to fight them back with the assistance of Inga
Inga is a descendant of Unwetter and by following Caldia s law he must seek Unwetter out and kill him
Kai then finds out that he truly is a descendant of Babbo
Kai Inga and Elise all volunteer to go and find Babbo s magic stones which would restore his memories of the Grand Elder who fought fake Arms and Unwetter 300 years prior to the story
The three are sent to Luberia to start their quest where they are to be helped by Nanashi
Kai beats Atmos and saves MÄR Heaven

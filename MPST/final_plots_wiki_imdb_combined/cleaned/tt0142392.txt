The story takes place 109 years after the complete destruction of human civilization
The Cold War had escalated into a world war fought mainly between China Russia and the United States
As the war progressed the three warring nations each created a super computer capable of running the war more efficiently than humans
The machines are each referred to as AM which originally stood for Allied Mastercomputer and then was later called Adaptive Manipulator
Finally AM stands for Aggressive Menace
One day one of the three computers becomes self aware and promptly absorbs the other two thus taking control of the entire war
It carries out campaigns of mass genocide killing off all but four men and one woman
The survivors live together underground in an endless complex the only habitable place left
The master computer harbors an immeasurable hatred for the group and spends every available moment torturing them
AM has not only managed to keep the humans from taking their own lives but has made them virtually immortal
The story s narrative begins when one of the humans Nimdok has the idea that there is canned food somewhere in the great complex
The humans are always near starvation under AM s rule and anytime they are given food it is always a disgusting meal that they have difficulty eating
Because of their great hunger the humans are coerced into making the long journey to the place where the food is supposedly kept the ice caves
Along the way the machine provides foul sustenance sends horrible monsters after them emits earsplitting sounds and blinds Benny when he tries to escape
On more than one occasion the group is separated by AM s obstacles
At one point the narrator Ted is knocked unconscious and begins dreaming
He envisions the computer anthropomorphized standing over a hole in his brain speaking to him directly
Based on this nightmare Ted comes to a conclusion about AM s nature specifically why it has so much contempt for humanity that despite its abilities it lacks the sapience to be creative or the ability to move freely
It wants nothing more than to exact revenge on humanity by torturing these last remnants of the species that created it
The group reaches the ice caves where indeed there is a pile of canned goods
The group is overjoyed to find them but is immediately crestfallen to find that they have no means of opening them
In a final act of desperation Benny attacks Gorrister and begins to gnaw at the flesh on his face
Ted in a moment of clarity realizes their only escape is through death
He seizes a stalactite made of ice and kills Benny and Gorrister
Ellen realizes what Ted is doing and kills Nimdok before being herself killed by Ted
Ted runs out of time before he can kill himself and is stopped by AM
AM unable to return Ted s four companions to life focuses all his rage on Ted
To ensure that Ted can never kill himself AM transforms him into a helpless gelatinous blob that is incapable of causing itself harm and constantly alters his perception of time to deepen his anguish
Ted is however grateful that he was able to save the others from further torture
Ted s closing thoughts end with the sentence that gives the story its title
I have no mouth
And I must scream

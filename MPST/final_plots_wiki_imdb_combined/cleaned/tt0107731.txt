Story Keiichi Morisato is a college sophomore who accidentally calls the Goddess Help Line and the goddess Belldandy materializes
She tells him that her agency has received a system request from him and has been sent to grant him a single wish
Believing that a practical joke is being played on him he wishes that she will stay with him forever and his wish is granted
Unable to live with Belldandy in his male only dorms they are forced to look for alternative housing eventually seeking shelter in an old Buddhist temple
They are allowed to stay there indefinitely after the young monk living there leaves on a pilgrimage to India upon being impressed by Belldandy s intrinsic goodness
Keiichi s life with Belldandy becomes even more hectic when her elder sister Urd and her younger sister Skuld move in as well
A series of adventures ensue as his relationship with Belldandy develops
Setting The Oh My Goddess
universe is fashioned loosely around Celtic Norse Mythology various names and concepts are recycled for humor
Three worlds exist in the Universe of Oh My Goddess Heaven Hell and Earth
Heaven is the realm of the All Mighty and goddesses Hell is the realm of Hild and demons and Earth is the realm of humans
Reality is controlled by an enormous and complex computer system named Yggdrasil
Each goddess is assigned Class Category and Restrictions
Class indicates power and skill in performing pure magic
First Class goddesses are held to a stricter standard regarding the prohibition to lie
There are also three categories Administration Commercial and Special Duty
Limited and Unlimited restrictions indicates boundaries on permitted actions
Goddesses may be penalized for dereliction of duty and may have their license suspended for a time
A goddess using her powers during suspension will have her license permanently revoked
Belldandy is a Goddess First Class Second Category Unlimited License
Urd and Skuld are Goddesses Second Class First Category Limited License
Goddesses also wear power limiters usually in the form of jewelry
The goddesses purpose is to bring happiness to everyone around them
Toward that end Heaven has created the Goddess Technical Helpline designed to bring happiness to the people of Earth especially those with great virtue but terrible misfortune
A competing institution named the Earth Assistance Center also is staffed by goddesses
In most scenarios a goddess appears before one that the system has deemed worthy and grants him or her one wish
The wish must be approved by the system after which a contract is created between the human and the goddess and stored on the Yggdrasil system as a file
The wish contract file is protected by a passcode known to the Goddess
As demons work toward the opposite end the total happiness on Earth must remain in balance
Heaven and Hell strictly abide by an agreement to work through contracts and never kill each other
Demons have similar class and license restrictions and are accompanied by familiars instead of angels
A seal exists between the demon world and Earth named the Gate to the Netherworld
It was created by the gods and can only be broken by an instrument of the gods
As such demons require a catalyst to manifest on Earth
The demons possess a system similar to Yggdrasil named Nidhogg
Both demons and goddesses possess the power to seal beings away
The demons also operate in a fashion similar to goddesses by creating contracts with humans and offering them wishes but often at a price
A goddess does not have an angel automatically but receives one in egg form
When her power matures the egg hatches into an angel becoming a lifetime companion
The angel always obeys the goddess being a reflection of the goddess inner self
Other creatures that exist in the Earth plane are a multitude of spirits that are responsible for almost every aspect of life
These include the spirits of Money Wind Engine and such
More specific entities include Earth spirits which are guardians over a specific area of land
Morgan le Fay a villain from the movie is probably a high ranking Earth spirit who demonstrates great strength fighting Belldandy and Urd even though her powers are less potent than the ones of goddesses of their level

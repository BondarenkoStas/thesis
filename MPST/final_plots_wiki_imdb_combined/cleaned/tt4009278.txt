Steven is a troubled kid who is being sent to boarding school
While his father Richard Portman is driving him to school Steven and his father get into a bad argument and the car swerves into the other lane causing a head on collision with an eighteen wheeler
Six months later Richard Portman has died and Steven has become a vegetable
His stepmother Mary takes care of his every need
Mary works from home with children and adolescents as a clinical psychologist giving sessions in the garage right next door to her house
Mary is informed by a woman named Grace that one of her patients a little boy named Tom who is hearing impaired is going to be transferred to another school in Boston
Mary protests but there s nothing she can do about it
Just before leaving Mary gives a Tom a scarf and hat that once belonged to her stepson Steven
Later that evening Mary discusses Steven with her therapist Dr Wilson
She has decided to put Steven in a home to be cared for called Covington because Steven is no longer there and he is just a body that she cares for and feeds
Mary expresses guilt for sending her stepson away and the accident which occurred
While bathing she daydreams of drowning Steven in the bathtub
After bathing Mary hears sounds in the house and goes to investigate
Once she gets outside Mary hears glass shattering and her car alarm goes off
In her garage Mary finds one of her car windows smashed in and Tom fast asleep on the backseat
She brings Tom inside and while she s discussing him on the phone Mary is locked inside her office
When she finally unlocks the door she finds her front door standing open and Tom is nowhere to be found
Mary informs the police and they search for Tom
She hears sounds in her house at night and dreams of herself searching for Tom
Doug Hart the father of one of her patients talks about a snow storm that is headed to their area and asks her out on a date
Mary declines implying that it would be unprofessional
She continues to hear sounds in the house at night
One night Mary sees Tom
He comes into her room and claps his hand over her mouth to keep her from screaming
Mary discusses the night s events with Dr Wilson and he tries to convince her that it wasn t real attributing it to parasomnia memories and the guilt she feels about Steven
Dr Wilson wants to prescribe her some medication to help her sleep so he sends a nurse over to Mary s house to do some blood work
Mary reconsiders and has dinner with Doug both of them discussing their respective teenagers
Later on Mary is frightened by a door slamming
When she investigates Steven is missing from his bed
She finds a small door to a crawlspace across from the stairway that s partially open but blocked by furniture
Mary opens it and is grabbed from inside by two small hands and has to fight to close the door
The next morning she wakes up on the floor
Steven is back in his bed but has scratches on his face
Dr Wilson again tries to convince her that she has sleep parasomnia and wants to prescribe antidepressants
Mary gets two invitations to leave her house for the storm one from her assistant Lucy and another from Doug Hart who visits her
She declines both
Dr Wilson contacts her via Skype with her blood work results
Dr Wilson admonishes Mary for self medicating because her stepson s medication is showing up in her blood
Mary denies taking any medication and distractedly and walks away from the computer without ending the call
Dr Wilson is about to end the call when he looks into Mary s living room and sees Steven s empty wheelchair
Right then Steven walks across the living room scaring Dr Wilson
The power and the lights go out in the house and Dr Wilson loses his computer connection to Mary
Dr Wilson tries to call Mary but can t get through
Mary is in the basement when the lights go out
She sees Tom in the dark and when Mary tries to leave the basement Steven blocks her way and attacks her
She wakes up bound gagged and naked in the bathtub and Steven is bathing her
He tells Mary how he woke up in the hospital after the accident with her there
Steven didn t move or speak so that he could relish in the attention that Mary gave him
He believes that for six months they were happy together just the two of them until Tom came
It turns out that Tom wasn t a ghost
He was alive and living in the crawlspace across from the stairs
Tom saw Steven moving around so Steven tried to deal with him but before he could Tom escaped into the crawlspace
Steven blocked him in there hoping he would starve to death
Mary really did see Tom every time he appeared
Steven was keeping her medicated with his medicine so he could walk around at night increasing her medication since Tom has been there
Steven medicates Mary so he can take care of Tom and leaves her in the bathroom
Mary unties herself and throws up the medication
Dr Wilson drives to Mary s house but wrecks his car on the way
Mary finds both Steven and Tom in the basement and Mary learns that Steven killed his father on purpose
She knocks Steven out and unties Tom
He runs when Steven wakes up and attacks Mary
She locks Steven in the basement
Tom and Mary hide in a closet
Steven breaks out of the basement and searches for them
Dr Wilson arrives as Steven is searching
Steven stabs him
Steven begins hammering
Mary collects Tom from the closet
When Steven goes upstairs Mary tries to leave and discovers Doug Hart s dead body in the snow
Dr Wilson still clinging to life advises Mary not to challenge Steven and to play along with his delusion so she can save herself and Tom
He dies
Steven has nailed all of the windows and doors shut so Mary breaks a skylight in the roof and Tom climbs out
Steven catches Mary and she plays along with him until she is able to burn him and knock him out
Mary opens one of the doors just as Steven wakes up
They run to the lake with Steven in pursuit
Mary blocks the path to Tom who is at the end of the pier
Steven pushes her aside and charges after Tom knocking him into the freezing water
Mary tries to stop him but he knocks her down again and begins to drown Tom
Mary grabs the hammer Steven threw down on the pier and bludgeons Steven with it knocking him into the water and killing him
The movie ends with Mary driving Tom to school

During the Second World War Tanner a swiss mountain farmer refuses to follow the government policy for the so called Anbauschlacht a plan to increase self sufficiency with produce
In his opinion the steep mountain pastures are not suited for agriculture
Most of the villagers agree
However some begin to cultivate
Even after all his fellow farmers have given in and have started to plant potatoes wheat and rye Tanner continues his opposition and ignores all letters and instructions
This leads to a series of reprimands for instance some of his hay is seized and his wife cannot buy at the local grocer s since the family won t comply with the government policy
One of the daughters is caught trying to sell cheese and eggs on the black market
Finally Tanner is arrested and imprisoned
He demonstrates his obstinacy and strength with a hunger strike
When the wardens try to tempt him to eat he tells them that he will start eating again back at home
The authorities finally see that the risk is too great and decide to let Tanner walk free
The weak old man is taken home by car and sleigh where he is welcomed by his family
He asks the men who brought him home to go inside and have a cup of coffee
In the meantime Tanner stays outside for a bit in the snow and dies

The twin cities of Sodom and Gomorrah prosper because of their great deposits of salt which are mined by an army of slaves
The decadent citizens who have become wealthy by trading salt live in luxury and use slaves as servants and for violent games of entertainment
After a night of revelry Astorath the Prince of Sodom tells slave girl Tamar to carry a message to the king of the Elamites with whom he plans to overthrow his sister Bera Queen of Sodom
Returning from her meeting in the desert with the Elamite leader Tamar is captured by a Sodomite patrol
Queen Bera demands the name of her co conspirator
Tamar refuses to speak under interrogation and Bera has her and her two young sisters killed
Meanwhile Lot leads his family and a Hebrew tribe through the desert hoping that he can find a permanent home for his people along the fertile banks of the River Jordan
By contrast with the people of the twin cities the Hebrews are presented as a pious and austere people with high moral standards
As the Hebrews approach their destination Lot meets the beautiful Ildith who luxuriates in a litter while a group of slave girls in chains precede her over the rocky terrain
Lot assumes that Ildith owns these women
She tells him that she is also a slave albeit the chief of the Queen of Sodom s body slaves
Lot tells her that owning slaves is evil
The following dialog ensues Ildith Evil
How strange you are
Where I come from nothing is evil
Everything that gives pleasure is good
Lot Where do you come from
Ildith There not far
Just ahead Sodom and Gomorrah
Once Lot and his people reach the Jordan he negotiates the use of the land on one side of the river with Queen Bera promising her both grain and defense should Sodom s desert enemies attack
In a surprising turn she gives Lot Ildith who does not wish to leave the queen and her life of luxury in Sodom
Astorath is disgusted and baffled by his sister s easy terms with the Hebrews
However he soon turns his attentions to Lot s flirtatious daughter Shuah
Ildith dislikes the rough conditions of the Hebrew camp but soon becomes a friend to Lot s daughters
She and Lot also fall in love and plan to marry
Love also blooms elsewhere in the camp as Shuah and Prince Astorath begin a secret affair
Lot s other daughter Maleb and his headstrong lieutenant Ishmael also plan a marriage
Lot and Ildith s wedding day celebrations are interrupted by an Elamite attack
Although the Hebrew farmers and the Sodomite soldiers fight valiantly they are nearly defeated by the fierce nomadic warriors
As a last desperate measure Lot orders the dam that the Hebrews have built to be broken
His quick thinking saves the twin cities and the Hebrews but the camp and the crops are destroyed
However the flood waters reveal that the Hebrew camp is also the site of a vast salt deposit
Lot now believes that the Hebrews can move out of the wilderness and live among the Sodomites by selling salt
Some time later Lot and Ildith now live in luxury in Sodom
Sodomites and Hebrews both revere Lot and seek his judgment
Ishmael however believes that Lot has succumbed to luxury and instead should liberate Sodom s mine slaves
Lot disagrees and advises Ishmael to wait believing that the Sodomites will change their ways in time
Ishmael does not heed Lot and unsuccessfully tries to set the slaves free
He believes that the Hebrews will harbour the slaves but they instead shut their doors on the desperate escapees who are soon recaptured and sentenced to death
As the newly appointed minister of justice Lot must now sentence Ishmael
However Ishmael is only one of Lot s problems as he is confronted by the jealous Prince Astorath who tells him that not only has he had both of Lot s daughters but that Ildith had known and kept the affairs secret
An outraged Lot kills Astorath
At this point Queen Bera s plot becomes clear she used the Hebrews to destroy the Elamite threat and also used Lot to rid her of her scheming brother
Lot becomes deeply remorseful that he has not only killed but he has led his family and people into sin
Bera has him taken to prison
While Lot asks God for forgiveness and guidance two angels appear to tell him that God is displeased with the twin cities and will destroy them
Lot pleads with the angels to spare the city if he can find just ten Sodomite citizens who will repent and leave the cities with him
The angels agree and free both Lot and Ishmael from prison
Meanwhile many recaptured slaves are tortured to death on the wheel
Queen Bera exclaims But wait the games have just begun as Lot appears seeking ten righteous Sodomites
Although he has God s consent Lot finds it impossible to persuade any Sodomite citizens to follow him only the slaves are willing to accompany him
Even his own daughters who believe Lot a hypocrite at first refuse
Ildith however convinces them to leave hoping that they will someday understand their father and his greatness as a leader
Shuah goes only grudgingly telling Lot that she hopes to see him suffering as she does now that Astorath is dead
Immediately after the Hebrews and Sodomite slaves leave God assails Sodom with earthquakes and lightning
Queen Bera retreats with her slave Orphea to her palace where they are killed under the collapsing pillars
Everybody flees into the streets and are crushed by collapsing towers
Meanwhile Ildith now wishes she were back in Sodom
Despite her love for Lot she cannot accept his God choosing to believe in Lot rather than in a Divine plan
Despite Lot s warnings Ildith looks back at Sodom
God turns her into a pillar of salt just as He destroys the city with a final fiery explosion
Lot collapses in grief
Maleb and Shuah rush to comfort him
He staggers off with the Hebrews who wander the desert once more

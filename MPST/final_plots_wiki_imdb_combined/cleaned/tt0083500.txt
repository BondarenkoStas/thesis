Phineas Bogg was one of a society of time travelers called Voyagers who with the help of a young boy named Jeffrey Jones from 1982 used a hand held device called an Omni to travel in time and ensured that history unfolded as we know it
Bogg and Jeffrey first met when Bogg s Omni malfunctioned and took him to 1982 landing him in the skyscraper apartment of Jeffrey s aunt and uncle who were caring for him after his parents deaths
Bogg s Guidebook which contained a detailed description of how history was supposed to unfold was grabbed by Jeffrey s dog Ralph and in the struggle to retrieve it Jeffrey accidentally fell out his bedroom window and Bogg jumped out to rescue him by activating the Omni
With his Guidebook stuck in 1982 Bogg had to rely on Jeffrey whose father had been a history professor to help him
Jeffrey s knowledge proved invaluable for example in the first episode Jeffrey ensured that baby Moses s basket traveled down the Nile where it was met by the Pharaoh s daughter
Phineas was timeless in his machismo and managed to fall for a beautiful woman in almost every episode
Whenever Jeffrey s wisdom was paired up against Bogg s stubbornness Jeffrey usually won out to which Bogg would always mutter Smart kids give me a pain
However they developed a strong relationship and became a formidable team
In the course of their adventures together they sometimes encountered other Voyagers whose missions happened to overlap with theirs
It was revealed later in the series that despite Jeffrey s age and the accidental circumstances of his first encounter with Phineas he was always destined to become a Voyager

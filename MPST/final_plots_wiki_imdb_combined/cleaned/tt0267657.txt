One evening Petrie begins telling a tale of the best creatures of the world the Flyers but it is met with disapproval from Cera
Meanwhile a herd of dinosaurs visits the Great Valley
Later that night Littlefoot sees a strange blue colored meteor falling from the sky and crashing into Threehorn Peak a volcano in the Smoking Mountain range
When Littlefoot describes it the next morning the adults in the Great Valley do not believe him except for two newcomers the mysterious Rainbow Faces who speak about possibilities of wonders beyond what they know
The Rainbow Faces suggest the rock may be a Stone of Cold Fire a stone possessing magical properties
Pterano the outcast uncle of Littlefoot s friend Petrie overhears the conversation and conspires to use the rock to take control of the Valley
Pterano asks Petrie who idolizes him for the location of the rock and learns its location
Littlefoot s friend Ducky overhears Pterano s plan but Pterano and his cronies Sierra and Rinkus abduct her before she can warn the others and set out to find the Stone
After discovering Ducky s kidnapping the adults tell the young ones how Pterano led some of their herd during their search for the Valley but had accidentally led his followers to a pack of Sharpteeth
Pterano was able to fly away but the event left him emotionally scarred
He was expelled from the herd as punishment for leading his followers to their deaths
Because the adults are slow to reach a decision Littlefoot Petrie Cera and Spike take off by themselves in search of Ducky
Meanwhile Ducky escapes and falls into a cave while fleeing
After the children find her Ducky comforts Petrie who is distraught about his uncle s actions by stating that Pterano is the least wicked of the three Flyers and that he still has a potential of doing good
Meanwhile Sierra displays mutinous feelings towards Pterano and Rinkus convinces him to betray Pterano once they find the Stone
The children pursue the Flyers hoping to reach the Stone before them
Aided by the Rainbow Faces who suddenly appear and offer their knowledge of volcanoes they manage to arrive at Threehorn Peak before the Flyers
However both groups discover that the Stone is just an ordinary meteorite
Lamenting over this realization Pterano explains that he had meant to create a paradise with the power of the stone not realizing that this paradise already exists in the form of the Great Valley
Unwilling to believe the Stone is not magical Sierra and Rinkus betray Pterano
However as they attempt to get the Stone to give them power the volcano begins to erupt and Pterano saves Ducky when she falls off the mountain
Petrie s mother arrives with a friend to evacuate the children leaving Sierra and Rinkus to be caught in the Stone s explosion
Pterano is thanked for saving Ducky but as punishment for his plan he is exiled from the Valley for five years which he accepts
That night Littlefoot finds the Rainbow Faces and asks them if the meteorite he saw really was a Stone of Cold Fire
They admit that while it wasn t his effort to search for it was what really mattered and reiterate that there are many unknowns to be discovered beyond the Mysterious Beyond
Littlefoot is then momentarily distracted and when he turns around he finds that the Rainbow Faces have disappeared in a pillar of light
As his friends find him an inspired Littlefoot reflects that there are many unknowns and that such unknowns make life wonderful

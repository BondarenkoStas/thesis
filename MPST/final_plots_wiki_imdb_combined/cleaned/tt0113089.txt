Fluke is a mutt puppy who has flashing memories and dreams of having lived a human life
After being taken to a pound and eventually escaping he is raised by an elderly homeless woman named Bella who gives him the name Fluke stating that he is a fluke by nature and by name
After Bella dies of an illness due to poor conditions Fluke meets a street wise dog named Rumbo who takes him to see a man named Bert who feeds Fluke and Rumbo
Fluke matures into an adult dog and eventually realizes that he was once a man named Thomas P Johnson who died in a car crash
Fluke is then abducted by a man named Sylvester to be used in makeup experiments at a cosmetics company
During his captivity Rumbo comes to the rescue and Rumbo is shot by Sylvester as he and Fluke escape
A dying Rumbo tells Fluke that the black and white snapshot of a man in a sailor suit on Bert s wall was him and Bert was his brother and that he wishes to smell the sea again suggesting that he died in the line of duty
After Rumbo s death Fluke seeks out his wife Carol and son Brian and reunites with them by becoming their new family dog
He suspects that his human death was caused by his former business partner Jeff Newman and viciously attacks him when he visits the house and ends up getting put outside
During his life as a dog he gets to know his family better and regrets his decisions as a workaholic
Fluke comes close to killing Jeff by causing him to get into a car accident that ends up with him being injured but has a flashback and realizes that Jeff wasn t responsible for his death
Instead his death was caused by his own anger and recklessness
Fluke eventually manages to show his wife who he really is by digging away the snow covering the word forever at the bottom of his tombstone something that in his human life he would often say to his wife
She is shocked but understanding and with a heavy heart he decides to leave and never return
He realized that life is simply meant to be cherished regardless of how one lives it
Far away and sometime later Fluke is resting under a tree by himself
To his surprise he encounters Rumbo now reincarnated as a squirrel
Rumbo tells Fluke about life as a squirrel and about reincarnation

Note The following synopsis refers to the original 205 minute version of the film
Andrei Rublev is divided into eight chapters with a prologue and an epilogue only loosely related to the main film
The main film charts the life of the great icon painter through several episodes of his life
The background is 15th century Russia a turbulent period characterized by fighting between rival princes and the Tatar invasions
The film s prologue shows the preparations for a hot air balloon ride
The balloon is tethered to the spire of a church next to a river with a man named Yefim attempting to make the flight by use of a harness roped beneath the balloon
At the very moment of his attempt an ignorant mob arrive from the river and attempt to thwart the flight putting a firebrand into the face of one of the men on the ground assisting Yefim
In spite of this the balloon is successfully released and Yefim is overwhelmed and delighted by the view from above and the sensation of flying but he can not prevent a crash landing shortly after
He is the first of several creative characters representing the daring escapist whose hopes are easily crushed
After the crash a horse is seen rolling on its back by a pond a symbol of life one of many horses in the movie
I
The Jester Andrei Daniil and Kirill are wandering monks and religious icon painters looking for work
The three represent different creative characters
Andrei is the observer a humanist who searches for the good in people and wants to inspire and not frighten
Daniil is withdrawn and resigned and not as bent on creativity as on self realization
Kirill lacks talent as a painter yet still strives to achieve prominence
He is jealous self righteous very intelligent and perceptive
The three have just left the Andronikov Monastery where they have lived for many years heading to Moscow
During a heavy rain shower they seek shelter in a barn where a group of villagers is being entertained by a jester
The jester or skomorokh is a bitterly sarcastic enemy of the state and the Church who earns a living with his scathing and obscene social commentary and by making fun of the Boyars
He ridicules the monks as they come in and after some time Kirill leaves unnoticed
Shortly a group of soldiers arrive to arrest the skomorokh whom they take outside knock unconscious and take away also smashing his musical instrument
As the rain has stopped the three monks thank the villagers for allowing them to shelter and continue on their way
As they walk on the heavy rain starts again
II
Theophanes the Greek Kirill arrives at the workshop of Theophanes the Greek a prominent and well recognized master painter who is working on a new icon of Jesus Christ
Theophanes is portrayed as a complex character an established artist humanistic and God fearing in his views yet somewhat cynical regarding his art more as a craft and a chore in his disillusion with other people
His young apprentices have all run away to the town square where a wrongly convicted criminal is about to be tortured and executed
Kirill talks to Theophanes and the artist impressed by the monk s understanding and erudition invites him to work as his apprentice on the decoration of the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow
Kirill refuses at first but then accepts the offer on the condition that Theophanes will personally come to the Andronikov Monastery and invite Kirill to work with him in front of all the fraternity and Andrei Rublev who according to Theophanes comments has some fame as an icon painter in the outside world
A short while later at the Andronikov Monastery a messenger arrives from Moscow to ask Andrei for his assistance in decorating the Annunciation Cathedral with Theophanes the Greek
Both Daniil and Kirill are agitated by the recognition that Andrei receives
Daniil refuses to accompany Andrei and reproaches him for accepting Theophanes offer without considering his fellows but soon repents of his temper and tearfully wishes Andrei well when the younger monk comes to say goodbye to his friend
Kirill is jealous of Andrei and in a fit of anger decides to leave the monastery for the secular world throwing accusations of greed in the face of his fellow monks who also dismiss him
Kirill stumbles out of the monastery into the snowy countryside and is pursued by his dog but Kirill savagely beats it with his walking stick and leaves it for dead
Andrei leaves for Moscow with his young apprentice Foma
Foma is another creative character representing the light hearted and practical minded commercial artist
Still he seems to be contemplative enough to get along with Andrei
III
The Passion According to Andrei While walking in the woods Andrei and Foma have a conversation about Foma s faults especially lying
Foma confesses to taking honey from the bee garden after Andrei notices his cassock is tacky and smears mud on his face to soothe a bee sting
While Foma has talent as an artist he is less concerned with the deeper meaning of his work and more concerned with practical aspects of the job like perfecting his azure a colour which in painting was often considered unstable to mix
They encounter Theophanes in the forest and the old master sends Foma away
As he leaves the apprentice finds a dead swan and pokes at it with a stick
We cut to banks of a stream where Andrei and Theophanes are arguing about religion while Foma cleans his master s paint brushes
Theophanes argues that the ignorance of the Russian people is due to stupidity while Andrei says that he doesn t understand how he can be a painter and maintain such views
This section contains a reenactment of Christ s Crucifixion on a snow covered hillside which plays out as Andrei recounts the story and expresses his belief that the men who crucified Jesus were obeying God s will and loved him
IV
The Feast Camping for the night on a riverbank Andrei and Foma are collecting firewood for their group when Andrei hears the distant sounds of celebration further upstream in the woods
Going to investigate he encounters a large group of naked pagans who are conducting a torch lit ritual for Midsummer
Andrei is intrigued and excited by the behaviour of the pagans but is caught spying on a couple making love is tied to the crossbeam of a hut in a mockery of Jesus crucifixion and is threatened with drowning in the morning
A woman named Marfa dressed only in a fur coat approaches Andrei
After explaining that her people are persecuted for their beliefs she drops her coat kisses Andrei and then unties him
Andrei runs away and is lost in the dense woods scratching his face
The next morning Andrei returns to his group including Daniil and as they leave on their boats a group of soldiers appear on the riverbank chasing after several of the pagans including Marfa
Her partner is captured but she makes her naked escape by swimming into the river past Andrei s boat
He and his fellow monks look away in shame
V The Last Judgment Andrei and Daniil are working on the decoration of a church in Vladimir
Although they have been there for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself
A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job
On a nearby road in the middle of a field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn t want to terrify people into submission
He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work
Foma impatient and ambitious resigns and leaves Andrei s group to take up the offer of painting a smaller less prestigious church
Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei s party have also been working on the Grand Prince s mansion
The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job at the mansion of the Grand Prince s brother and refuse
On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out so that they cannot replicate their work
Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls
Sergei one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud at Daniil s request concerning women
Durochka wanders in out of the rain and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall
Her feeble mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast
VI
The Raid While the Grand Prince is away in Lithuania his power hungry younger brother forms an allegiance with a group of Tatars and raids Vladimir
We see flashbacks of the Grand Prince and his brother attending a religious service in the church and see the rivalry and animosity between them
The invasion of the combined armed forces on horseback and the resulting carnage is shown in great detail
The city is burned the citizens are murdered and women raped and killed
One scene shows a horse falling from a flight of stairs and being stabbed by a spear
Another shows a cow being set on fire
Foma narrowly escapes being killed in the city and escapes into the nearby countryside but as he is crossing a river he is shot in the back with an arrow and killed
The Tatars force their way into the barricaded church now fully decorated with Andrei s paintings where the majority of the citizens have taken refuge
The Tatars show no mercy and massacre the people inside and burn all the painted wooden altarpieces
Andrei saves Durochka from being raped by killing a Tatar with an axe
The Bishop s messenger is cruelly tortured to make him reveal the location of the city s gold which he refuses to do
After being repeatedly burned he has liquid metal from a melted crucifix poured into his mouth and is dragged away tied to a horse
In the aftermath only Andrei and Durochka are left alive in the church
Andrei imagines a conversation with the dead Theophanes the Greek lamenting the loss of his work and the evil of mankind while Durochka distractedly plaits the hair of a dead woman
Andrei decides to give up painting and takes a vow of silence to atone for killing another man
VII
The Silence Andrei is once again at the Andronikov Monastery as famine and war grip the country
He no longer paints and never speaks and keeps Durochka with him as a fellow companion in silence
Several refugees discuss the problems in their respective home towns and one man talks in a broken voice of his escape from Vladimir
He is recognised by a younger monk as the long absent Kirill
He has suffered during his time away from the monastery and begs the father superior to allow him to return
His wish is granted but he is instructed to copy out the holy scriptures fifteen times in penance
A group of Tatars stops at the monastery while travelling through the region much to the concern of Andrei and Kirill who experienced their brutality first hand
Durochka is too simple minded to remember what the Tatars did and is fascinated by one of the soldier s shining breastplate
The group taunt and play with her but the soldier takes a liking to her putting his horned helmet on her head and dressing her as a bride finally deciding to take her away with him as his eighth and only Russian wife
Andrei attempts to stop her from leaving but she is determined and rides away with the Tatars
Kirill talks to Andrei for the first time since they both left the monastery and he assures him that Durochka won t be in any danger as harming a holy fool is considered bad luck and she will be let go
Andrei continues his menial work of carrying large hot stones from a fire with tongs to heat water for the monastery but drops the stone in the snow
VIII
The Bell Andrei s life turns around as he witnesses the casting of a bell for the Grand Prince
Boriska is the young son of a bellmaker all his family have died of a plague that has ravaged the area
He tells the Prince s men that he is the only one who possesses his father s secret delivered at the death bed of casting a bronze bell and persuades them to take him with them as he is the only person left alive who can make it successfully
Boriska is put in charge of the project and frequently contradicts and challenges the instincts of his co workers when choosing the location of the pit the selection of the proper clay the building of the mold the firing of the furnaces and finally the hoisting of the bell
Even Boriska expresses doubts that he will succeed in making the bell ring
The process of making the bell grows into a huge expensive endeavour with many hundreds of workers and Boriska makes several risky decisions guided only by his instincts
As the furnaces are opened and the molten metal pours into the mould he privately asks God for help
Andrei silently watches Boriska during the casting and the younger man notices him too
During the bell making the skomorokh from the first sequence makes a reappearance amongst the crowds who have come to watch the bell being raised up and he threatens to kill Andrei whom he mistakes for the man who denounced him years earlier and therefore led to his arrest torture and prison sentence
Kirill intervenes on behalf of the silent Andrei and later privately confesses that his sinful envy of Andrei s talent dissipated once he heard Andrei had abandoned painting and that it was he Kirill who had denounced the skomorokh
Kirill then criticises Andrei for allowing his God given talent for painting to go to waste and pleads with him to resume his artistry to no response
As the bell making nears completion Boriska s confidence slowly transforms into a stunned detached disbelief that he s succeeded at the task
The work crew takes over as Boriska makes several attempts to fade into the background of the activity
Once the bell has been hoisted into its tower the Grand Prince and his entourage arrive for the inaugural ceremony as the bell is blessed by the priests
As the bell is prepared to be rung the royal entourage is overhead discussing their doubts that it will
It is revealed that Boriska and the work crew know if the bell fails to ring the Grand Prince will have them all beheaded
There is a quiet agonizing tension as the foreman slowly coaxes the bell s clapper back and forth nudging it closer to the lip of the bell with each swing
A pan across the assembly reveals white robed Durochka leading a horse as she walks through the crowd
At the critical moment the bell rings perfectly and she smiles
After the ceremony Andrei finds Boriska collapsed on the ground sobbing
He admits his father never told him the secret of casting a bell
Andrei comforts him breaking his vow of silence and telling the boy that they should carry on their work together You ll cast bells
I ll paint icons Andrei sees Durochka the boy and the horse walk off across a muddy field in the distance
The epilogue is the only part of the film in colour and shows time aged but still vibrant details of several of Andrei Rublev s actual icons
The icons are shown in the following order Enthroned Christ Twelve Apostles The Annunciation Twelve Apostles Jesus entering Jerusalem Birth of Christ Enthroned Christ Transfiguration of Jesus Resurrection of Lazarus The Annunciation Resurrection of Lazarus Birth of Christ Trinity Archangel Michael Paul the Apostle The Redeemer
The final scene crossfades from the icons and shows four horses standing by a river in the rain

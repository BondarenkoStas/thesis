Devil May Cry 2 begins with Lucia and Dante separately entering a museum where an important item called the Medaglia is stored
After defeating a group of demons in the museum Lucia invites Dante to follow her to the Dumary Island where he is introduced to Matier her mother
Matier explains that she once fought alongside Dante s father Sparda to defend the island against demons
She asks Dante to help fight Arius an international businessman who is using demonic power in an effort to conquer the world
Dante flips a coin in answer and decides to help when the coin lands on heads
After Dante leaves Matier and Lucia discuss the Arcana the items required for Arius to raise the demon Argosax
Lucia eventually confronts Arius who reveals that she was his creation
When she moves to strike him he uses his magic to blast her away
Shortly afterward Dante meets up with Lucia who gives him the last of the Arcana before leaving
Dante then encounters Matier and tries to pass the Arcana to her
Matier in turn asks Dante to take the Arcana to save Lucia who has gone to fight Arius again
Dante flips the coin again to decide if he will help it lands on heads and he departs to aid Lucia
Meanwhile Lucia enters the Uroboros tower and attacks Arius who captures her
Dante arrives and trades the Arcana for Lucia then attacks Arius
To escape Arius forces Dante to decide between saving Lucia or killing him
Lucia worried about the ritual and conflicted about herself wonders how they will stop Arius
Dante waves her off stating he will find a way
Dante leaves Lucia to think as he departs to defeat Arius
Matier arrives a short time later sets Lucia s mind at ease and persuades her to rejoin the fight against Arius
Dante arrives at the tower to find Arius in the middle of his immortality inducing ritual
However Dante is not worried as he switched one of the Arcana with a false coin
Another fight ensues in which Dante finishes Arius off with his pistols
Outside Lucia confronts Dante and demands that he kill her because she fears she will become a demon herself
Before the issue can be resolved a large stream of energy strikes the tower and a portal to the demon world is opened
Dante and Lucia argue over who will enter and close it from the inside Dante offers to leave the issue up to fate
He flips the coin and it once again lands on heads leaving Dante to enter the portal to deal with the partially summoned Argosax after leaving the coin with Lucia
After Dante departs Arius returns to life bearing demonic power
While Lucia fights Arius he finds himself injured and attempts to distract her a tactic which fails and Lucia goes on to defeat him
Within the portal Dante fights and defeats Argosax
Finding the portal closed behind him Dante instead drives further into the demon realm on a motorcycle
In the aftermath of the battle Matier attempts to reassure Lucia about Dante s fate insisting that Sparda returned from a similar trip
Lucia examines the coin Dante left with her and discovers that both sides are identical
Sometime later in Dante s shop Lucia muses about Dante
Outside the sound of a motorcycle echoes and Lucia leaves to investigate
The player is not shown if Dante has returned

Although the main narrative of the game runs parallel to the narrative in the film trilogy the plot is not intended as an original canonical story to fit into the plot as developed in the films
This is primarily seen insofar as the party are present during certain battles which in the films are solo fights such as when Gandalf faces the Balrog in The Fellowship of the Ring or when Éowyn faces the Witch king of Angmar in The Return of the King
The game also features events which don t take place in the films at all such as a battle between the party and Gríma Wormtongue in Snowbourne and another against the Eye of Sauron atop Barad dûr
Throughout the game Gandalf speaks to Berethor by means of Epic Scenes film clips which the player can collect and which feature original narration by Gandalf
These clips give context to much of the plot and serve to offer advice to Berethor of events in the wider world
Background The game is presented against the background of the history of the One Ring
At the dawn of the Second Age after the defeat of the Dark Lord Morgoth the elves of Eregion forged the nineteen Rings of Power to help themselves the dwarves and men rule Middle earth
However the elves were unaware that Sauron Morgoth s closest ally had survived his master s defeat and in the guise of Annatar had been the one who taught the Elven smiths led by Celebrimbor how to forge the Rings whilst in secret he forged his own One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom a Ring far more powerful than any of the others
However in order for the One Ring to be powerful enough to control the other Rings Sauron had to transfer most of his power into it
As soon as he put it on the elves became aware of his ruse removing and hiding their Three Rings which Celebrimbor had forged without Sauron s aid
Sauron waged war on the elves conquering much of Middle earth and killing Celebrimbor
Thus began the Dark Years when Sauron took possession of the remaining sixteen Rings giving seven to the dwarves and nine to men in an effort to corrupt them
The dwarves proved relatively immune to the powers of the Rings acquiring only a greed for gold and becoming unconcerned with events in the wider world
Men proved less resilient and the nine kings given the Rings become the nine Ring wraiths or Nazgûl led by the Witch king of Angmar
In his ongoing efforts to conquer Middle earth Sauron regained the allegiance of many of Morgoth s servants from the First Age and successfully corrupted Númenor
However in doing so he expended a great deal of his power and lost the ability to ever again assume a pleasing disguise
Returning to Mordor he regained his strength eventually capturing Minas Ithil
However realizing that if they did not join together Sauron would destroy both men and elves Elendil High King of Arnor and Gil galad High King of Noldor formed the Last Alliance of Men and Elves and attacked Sauron in his fortress Barad dûr
The alliance was victorious with Isildur cutting the One Ring from Sauron s hand
However although presented with a chance to destroy the Ring forever Isildur already beginning to succumb to its corruption chose not to do so
As such although Sauron s physical form was vanquished his spirit bound to the Ring survived
Some time later Isildur was attacked and killed by a band of orcs and the Ring was lost in the river Anduin for over two thousand years
Meanwhile during the Third Age a still weakened Sauron covertly established a stronghold at Dol Guldur
In response to this undetermined evil the Valar sent five Maiar to Middle earth
Taking the form of wizards they were led by Saruman
Unsure of the origin of the evil power in Dol Guldur the wizard Gandalf was sent to investigate
However Sauron hid from Gandalf waiting for four hundred years before returning
Around the same time the One Ring was found by a Hobbit named Sméagol who became utterly corrupted by it living in the caves of the Misty Mountains and physically transforming into a creature known as Gollum
For five hundred years Gollum was consumed and corrupted by the Ring
Eventually Gandalf was able to determine the evil presence in Dol Guldur was indeed Sauron
Gandalf reported back to the White Council but Saruman dissuaded them from moving against Sauron
Only when he learned the One Ring may be in the vicinity of the Gladden Fields did Saruman agree to attack Sauron hoping to find the Ring himself
The Council drove Sauron from Dol Guldur unaware that he knew the Ring had been found
Just prior to Sauron s departure the Ring passed to another hobbit Bilbo Baggins who used it to assist in the victory of elves men and dwarves at the Battle of the Five Armies
Sixty years later Gollum was captured by orcs and taken to Mordor where he was tortured into revealing the owner and location of the Ring Bilbo Baggins of the Shire
In the meantime Bilbo had left the Shire to live in Rivendell and upon the advice of Gandalf had given the Ring to his nephew Frodo Baggins
With the information given him by Gollum Sauron still unable to take physical form thus sent the Nazgûl to the Shire to retrieve the One Ring
Frodo and his friends Samwise Gamgee Peregrin Pippin Took and Meriadoc Merry Brandybuck managed to escape the Shire and make it to Bree where they encountered the ranger Aragorn the last surviving descendent of Isildur and rightful heir to the throne of Gondor
Aragorn protected the hobbits on their journey to Rivendell and upon their arrival Elrond formed a Fellowship with the goal of bringing the Ring to Mordor to destroy it
The Fellowship is composed of Frodo Sam Merry Pippin Aragorn Gandalf a silvan elf from Mirkwood named Legolas a dwarf from Erebor named Gimli and a man from Gondor named Boromir son of Denethor Steward of Gondor
Plot The game begins with Berethor a captain in the Citadel Guard of Gondor travelling to Rivendell to find Boromir at the behest of Denethor
On the outskirts of Rivendell he is attacked by the Nazgûl but is rescued by Idrial an elf in the service of Galadriel
As they travel through the forest they see a murder of crebain and Idrial deduces Saruman has betrayed the elves leaving Middle earth for the Grey Havens
Seeing her convoy under attack by Isengard orcs she and Berethor intervene
They then head to Caradhras to seek any further survivors and there meet Elegost a Dúnedain ranger hunting wargs
They learn the Fellowship tried to pass over Caradhras recently but were prevented from doing so by a snowstorm unleashed by Saruman and so they instead elected to pass through the mines of Moria
Elegost explains he was hunting with a dwarven companion when they were caught in the storm and separated
The three head towards Moria soon finding the dwarf Hadhod
Upon entering Moria Hadhod learns the rumors regarding Balin and the dwarves are true they have been wiped out by orcs
They pursue the Fellowship finding themselves on the floor below them and seeing a Balrog ascending from the depths
They follow it eventually reaching the Bridge of Khazad dûm
There they join Gandalf as he faces the Balrog
They help him to victory but are unable to prevent him falling from the bridge
However unbeknownst to the Fellowship Gandalf is resurrected by the Valar
Meanwhile the party exits Moria and follows in the footsteps of the Fellowship passing through Lothlórien
They soon learn that Boromir is dead that Frodo and Sam have headed towards Mordor to destroy the Ring and that the rest of the Fellowship have gone to Rohan
They too head towards Rohan
However Saruman has used his agent Gríma Wormtongue to corrupt Théoden King of Rohan manipulating him into banishing Éomer captain of the Rohirrim
Saruman plans to use the division caused by this to destroy Rohan
The party meet the resurrected Gandalf who tells them they must assemble Éomer s men and head towards Helm s Deep where Rohan will make a last stand against Saruman s army
In the meantime Gandalf will attempt to release Théoden from Saruman s curse
Soon thereafter they meet a woman named Morwen who joins the party on the road to Helm s Deep in the hopes of finding her family
Having assembled Éomer s scattered forces the party begin to make their way to Helm s Deep
On the journey Morwen reveals she is originally from Minas Tirith and the party receive word that Théoden has been released from Saruman s spell
On the road they meet Éoaden a member of Rohan s Royal Guard who joins them
Soon thereafter they find the bodies of Morwen s family killed by wargs before arriving at Helm s Deep
Inside the fortress they prepare for battle
Soon Saruman s army of 10 000 Uruk hai arrive
They breach the outer walls using explosives and overwhelm the inner defenses
As Berethor fights he suddenly hears the voice of Saruman telling him he shall be punished for his betrayal
Gandalf and Éomer arrive with the Rohirrim attacking and decimating the Uruk hai army
Meanwhile the Ents roused to war by Saruman s partial destruction of Fangorn Forest lay siege to Orthanc ending Saruman s involvement in the war
Gandalf then explains to Berethor why he heard the voice of Saruman Berethor was captured by Saruman who put him under a spell
Saruman believed Boromir would take the Ring from Frodo and Berethor s job was to take it from Boromir and return it to Saruman
However Boromir did not take the Ring
Knowing of Saruman s plan Gandalf and Galadriel sent Idrial to find Berethor and stay by him until the spell could be broken and with the destruction of Orthanc Berethor is freed from the spell
Gandalf tells the party that Sauron will now turn his eye to Minas Tirith
Gandalf rides on ahead and sends the party to the ruined city of Osgiliath to stand alongside Boromir s brother Faramir
As they await the arrival of the army Berethor muses that Osgiliath seems familiar to him
Éoaden remembers a Gondorian warrior who fought under Boromir during the defense of the city some time ago but who fled the battle in fear
The party realize that Berethor is that man
He vows he will never flee again and the party join Faramir in a fight against Gothmog
They defeat him but he flees before they can kill him
Gandalf then summons the party back to Minas Tirith
Before they leave however Berethor learns the reason he fled Osgiliath was because he was stabbed by a Morgul blade the tip of which is still within him
He and Idrial face the Witch king but Idrial explains he cannot harm the Witch king whilst the blade is still inside him
He cuts it out and they attack the Witch king driving him off
The party then head to Minas Tirith
They reach the city just after the Mordor army has breached the main gate with orcs rampaging through the streets
Meanwhile the Witch king confronts Gandalf who is joined by the party in the fight
During the battle they hear the horns of the Rohirrim and the Witch king flees
The party head to the citadel at the top of the city where they witness the death of the insane Denethor at the hands of Gandalf
They then learn that Aragorn is on his way with the Army of the Dead
The battle moves to the Pelennor Fields as the Rohirrim charge the Mordor army
The Witch king attacks Théoden and Éowyn comes to his aid
The party join her as she fights and they are able to defeat him
Soon thereafter Aragorn arrives with the Army of the Dead who wipe out the Mordor army
As the party celebrate the eight remaining Nazgûl attack stabbing Morwen
They defeat the Nazgûl and Aragorn is able to save Morwen s life
He then tells the party the entire army is to march on the Black Gate to distract Sauron from Frodo s approach to Mount Doom
At the same time the party attack the Eye of Sauron itself
As they fight Frodo successfully destroys the Ring and Sauron is defeated
In the aftermath of the victory Gandalf tells Berethor he will face more adventures saying Your tale has hardly begun

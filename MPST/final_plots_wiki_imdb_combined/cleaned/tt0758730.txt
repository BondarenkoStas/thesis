The hybrid attacks the crew killing them and forcing the ship to crash land in Gunnison Colorado
Before one of the Predators is killed he sends a distress call to his homeworld
His message is received by a veteran hardened Predator soldier who immediately embarks on the journey to Earth to clean up the situation
Meanwhile the facehuggers escape from the crashed ship and impregnate a father and son hunting team and later two homeless men living in the sewer system Dallas returns to Gunnison after being released from prison
He is picked up at the bus station by Morales Dallas and Morales used to be partners in crime but Morales is now the county s sheriff
Also arriving home is Kelly after being deployed overseas as a soldier of the U S Army s 101st Airborne Division
Her husband Tim is overjoyed to see her but their daughter Molly is unsure of how to react to her mother s return
She does however enjoy the night vision goggles Kelly brought home as a souvenir
Meanwhile Dallas s younger brother Ricky is beaten up by Dale and his friends
Ricky has been flirting with Dale s girlfriend Jesse
The fight is the last straw and Jesse breaks things off with Dale
She invites Ricky to go skinny dipping with her at the high school s pool later that night The Predator arrives and scavenges weapons from the downed vessel then destroys it
He uses an acidic fluid to destroy the corpses of the alien s current victims as well as the facehuggers he finds
When Deputy Ray stumbles upon the scene the Predator kills him and skins his corpse
When Morales and Dallas find Ray s body they realize that something horrible is stalking the town The Predator tracks the aliens to the city s sewer system
He dispatches several but is caught off guard by the Predalien
The Predalien and other aliens escape into the city and begin to attack the citizens
The Predator follows one to the city s nuclear power station
In the ensuing battle the station is damaged and the city loses power
Morales realizes that the entire county is in danger and orders the town evacuated
He also requests National Guard assistance
The Predalien realizes he can use fertile women to create hordes of aliens without needing facehuggers
At the local hospital it injects alien larvae into all of the pregnant mothers in the maternity ward
Within hours a small army of aliens has been created At the high school Ricky s swim date with Jesse is interrupted when Dale and his friends arrive and attack Ricky
Before they can drown him in the pool an alien arrives and kills Dale s friends
Jesse Ricky and Dale escape and find Morales and Dallas at the power station
They tell them what has happened which Morales and Dallas largely confirm by visiting the school
They don t find any corpses however as the Predator has already been there to kill the alien and destroy the evidence
Morales Dallas Ricky Jesse and Dale realize they need weapons to protect themselves and break into a local sporting goods store
They are joined by Kelly and Molly who have been attracted by the flashing lights on Morales s squad car
Earlier an alien had attacked their home killing Tim Morales makes contact with the arriving National Guardsmen
All he hears however is the sound of them being slaughtered by the aliens
Then aliens appear in the sporting goods store
However the Predator has followed them there and kills the aliens
Dale s face is melted off by alien acid blood but the others escape
They make their way to the scene of the Guardsmen slaughter
Kelly knows how to drive the tanks so they all climb in
Morales contacts Col Stevens who tells them to head to the center of town to be airlifted out of town
However the plan is not to airlift anyone to safety but instead to use the townspeople as bait to draw the aliens to one area and then destroy everyone with a small nuclear bomb
Kelly realizes that they will all die if they do as Stevens tells them but Morales doesn t believe her
When they encounter a number of other people headed towards the center of town Morales joins them Kelly Molly Dallas Ricky and Jesse head for the hospital where they will use the medevac helicopter to fly to safety The hospital is overrun with aliens and the Predator arrives to destroy them
Making their way up the stairs the humans run into the middle of a Predator Alien battle
Jesse is impaled by the Predator s flying daggers
Enraged Ricky attacks the Predator with a machine gun but before the Predator can kill him the aliens knock it down an elevator shaft
Ricky is wounded but will live
The Predator leaves behind a pulse rifle which Dallas picks up
They make their way to the roof but aliens block their path to the helicopter
As Dallas uses the pulse rifle to hold off the aliens Kelly gets the helicopter started
Just as the aliens are about to surround and kill Dallas the Predator arrives and kills off the remaining aliens
Dallas boards the helicopter and they fly away as the Predator and Predalien duel to the death At the center of town the humans are surrounded by aliens
Looking up to the skies in hopes of seeing rescue helicopters Morales instead sees a jet fighter drop a bomb he realizes Kelly was right as the town and all of the remaining aliens are incinerated including the Predator and Predalien who are locked in each others death grip
Kelly manages to pilot the helicopter to a fairly safe crash landing
They are surrounded by other Colorado National Guardsmen of the U S Army Special Forces who disarm them and provide medical care to Ricky
They confiscate the Predator plasma rifle from Dallas Col
Stevens takes the Predator pulse rifle to Ms Yutani
She tells him that the earth is not ready for the technology it represents
Col Stevens knows Yutani doesn t want the technology to be used on Earth

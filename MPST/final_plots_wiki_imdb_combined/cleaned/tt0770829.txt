Inspector Giovanni Sanzio a Keenan Wynn look alike is on the case in this Italian version of Norwegian author Karin Fossum s mystery novel Don t Look Back A beautiful girl is found dead on the lakeshore of a small Italian Alpine village and Inpsector Sanzio is called in to employ his tremendous powers of professional guesswork to discover they whys and wherefores
In the process he stumbles across an earlier murder the choking of an autistic 3 year old by his parents After chasing somewhat desperately after one false lead after another Insp
Sanzio lights on the autistic boy s father murderer of both his own son and the young lady who had been the son s babysitter
The father was tired of the girl s accusing stares guilty that neither he nor his wife could understand let alone handle their son s autism Oddly enough the girl was suffering from a terminal brain tumor and having only months to live without her cherished little babysitting charge she allows the father to drown her in the lake
Significantly Insp
Sanzio arrives on the scene to note the girl has been carefully laid on her side with her head awkwardly turned away and this says the inspector shows she was murdered without offering resistance by a murder she knew and trusted It amazes the viewer how laid back and calm these European mysteries are cops are relatively sedate and everything seems to be located in the boonies far from civilization
Though the film meanders with silly red herrings it nonetheless demonstrates how a real homicide detective does the job whether it s Europe or America
The little Alpine Italian village is beautiful adding some respite from the horror of murder
The Italian dialect spoken here is very melodic it is much more like the Spanish sounding Friuli language of Switzerland
Viewers will enjoy this subtle beautifully shot movie
Fans of Karin Fossum will appreciate the way the Italians handled her globally popular Inspector Sejer mystery

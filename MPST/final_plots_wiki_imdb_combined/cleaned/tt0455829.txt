Rani the daughter of former Chennai police officer Arokiya Raj tells her father over the phone that she will be back home in Madurai in three hours
As she leaves the telephone booth she is approached by someone she knows
Rani does not come home
The following morning Arokiya Raj finds Rani s finger hanging at his door
Arokiya Raj calls Raghavan his old friend and fellow police detective from Chennai to help in the investigation of Rani s disappearance
With Raghavan s assistance the police eventually find Rani s body in the outskirts of the city
The coroner s report states that the killer bisected Rani s body with a surgical knife proving that the murderer has a strong medical background and that he also savagely raped her
Following the trauma of losing their only daughter Arokiya Raj and his wife move to New York to be closer to their other children who are living in America
After some time Raghavan learns that Arokiya Raj and his wife have been brutally murdered in New York
This creates a link between the Chennai police and the New York Police Department
Raghavan leaves for New York to represent the Indian police
On the flight he reminisces about his late wife Kayalvizhi who was murdered by a local gang because he was a threat to them
Raghavan still blames himself for his wife s murder and has remained single ever since
Once in New York he begins his investigation with NYPD detective Anderson
Raghavan stays in a hotel in downtown New York where he constantly keeps his superiors in Chennai updated on the investigation
Staying next to his room is Aradhana an NRI
He immediately notices that she is going through a rough time in her life
One night he gets suspicious about what she is up to and breaks into her room only to find her attempting suicide by strangling herself
Raghavan saves her life and the two strike a friendship
Aradhana reveals that her violent husband is filing for divorce after cheating on her
At the same time Raghavan and Anderson find a connection between Rani s murder in Madurai and an Indian American girl Chandana whose finger was also found hung in her boyfriend s car
Using Raghavan s instincts they find the body of Chandana and three more American girls raped and murdered in similar ways hidden in a restricted area in the suburbs
After narrowing down on their suspects based on flight records their suspicion falls on two Indian medical students studying in New York Amudhan and Ilamaaran
Raghavan and Anderson visit Amudhan and Ilamaaran s apartment to question them
Since they are not home Raghavan and Anderson break into their apartment and find photos and details of the murdered girls
Before they can call for backup Amudan and Ilamaaran come home
A violent fight breaks out and Anderson is shot dead while Raghavan is injured and Ilamaaran falls unconscious
In order to buy time Raghavan asks Amudhan why such intelligent young men like them would succumb to such psychopathic acts
Amudhan explains that ever since they were children they had developed a habit of killing
He claims that he managed to keep his violent urges under control for three years
However the animal inside him was revived on the night he and Ilamaaran were arrested by Arokiya Raj for assaulting Rani
The inspector on duty had them locked up at a local station for a night with a eunuch who molested them
Thirsty for revenge both of them left for New York City to pursue their higher studies in medicine and went on to kill many local young women
During their summer break in India they killed Rani and then returned to the States
After finding out that Arokiya Raj had moved to New York they killed him and his wife
Thinking Raghavan will be dead in minutes due to the stabbings they set their apartment on fire and take the next flight to Mumbai to escape the NYPD
Raghavan makes it out alive by jumping out the window and is hospitalised
Aradhana takes care of him and their bond grows stronger
Raghavan and Aradhana return to Chennai together
During their flight Aradhana explains that she has a daughter who is living with her parents in Chennai and she feels guilty for wanting to commit suicide so selfishly
As they wait in line for customs Raghavan proposes to Aradhana but she refuses saying that she is not ready for another relationship having just finalised her divorce as she wishes to focus on being a good mother to her daughter first
Amudhan and Illamaran who have evaded Mumbai police at Chatrapati Shivaji International Airport reach Chennai through Goa and Kozhikode
Amudhan after seeing Aradhana with Raghavan kidnaps her while Ilamaaran tries to get into Raghavan s house to kill him but flees after the cops charges
He is chased and caught by Raghavan
After murdering many in a duel between them Raghavan eventually kills both Amudhan and Illamaran and rescues Aradhana who accepts his love and they marry

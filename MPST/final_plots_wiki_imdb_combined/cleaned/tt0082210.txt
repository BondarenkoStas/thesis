Just after she recovered from the abortion she run away from home and Nico lost her trail until half a year later he got word she was in Madrid working in Las Gatitas a high end nightclub as an escort
Indirectly it is shown that in the best cinema noir line Germán is a cold blooded hard boiled man disenchanted of a lonely life and tired of his dirty work and the violent underworld surrounding it but nevertheless in his spare time Germán has a blossoming relationship with Carmen a nurse he met when he was in hospital some time ago
Carmen has a four year old daughter Maite born from a former relation with a married doctor
Carmen has not overcome completely the end of that relation but reveals to Germán she likes being with him but she still needs some time and patience from him
The detective is so fond of the little girl Maite he often takes her to or from school and plays with her and evidently his only moments of real happiness are while being with Carmen and Maite
El Moro confirms the nightclub lead was correct but Isabel Medina is not there anymore
He learns that she left and enrolled in a private VIP escort pool which head is Mimí de Torres the Madame of a luxury brothel in the dark but a lady with an impeccable social face up front and wealthy and powerful customers who have become friends
Germán proceeds to visit Mimí de Torres but After Germán explains to her the story of Isabel s disappearance and his knowledge of her working for Mimí for some time Mimí denies everything and dismisses Germán from her house after a brief argument
Not long after Germán starts receiving pressure from various channels to stop investigating the case of Isabel Medina s disappearance
His former police superior with whom he still deals now and then as part of his detective job informally meets him and tells him that someone from a high spot is taking an interest in his investigation and suggests him to stop it at once since Mimí de Torres has powerful friends in politics financial areas etc
Then his former police colleague Alberto El Guapo an impeccably dressed young man now also working free lance in the Security private sector for some wealthy clients meets him and after discussing German s confrontation with Mimí de Torres offers him to join his security group with an excellent wage with the unspoken condition that he stops the Medina investigation immediately
Germán refuses his offer at once but wonders what will come next now that he has turned down the carrot offered to him
When Germán contacts Francisco Medina to speak with him again he founds out that he is in an hospital ICU with a terminal illness he had not revealed to Germán
He is aware he has a short time to live and what he wanted is to see his daughter before dying

In the spring of 1962 four high school seniors are arriving on school grounds including Angela and Judith who are both cheerleaders for the school football team and Duke school heartthrob and star player of the team
As they pull into a parking spot they find Wayne Stein bookish school nerd tending to his bike there
Duke berates Wayne for parking in Angela s spot even though Wayne is just trying to fix a flat on his bike
Trying to appease Duke whom she s dating Angela tells him she s never seen Wayne before Angela and Duke sneak in a few kisses while the national anthem begins playing in the school halls and school history teacher and Angela s guidance counselor Mr Tatum promptly ushers Duke toward his home room but orders Angela to come with him into his office
Angela is failing her history class because she hasn t been paying attention to the teachers
Mr Tatums warns her that if she flunks her classes she ll be denied graduation
Over her protests Mr Tatum has assigned her a tutor Wayne But at a study session at Wayne s house Wayne finds a way to reach her
Angela pays attention when she listens to music and is able to memorize the lyrics when singing along
He improvises a set of lyrics about D Day to That ll be the Day and Angela smiles at his cleverness Angela and Judith are helping set up the school gymnasium for senior prom
Angela is upset because Mr Tatum overruled plans to feature a theme for late actor James Dean because he d been drinking the night of his fatal car accident
Angela wishes she could meet someone like Dean and Cindy points out that Angela has Duke
Mr Tatum interrupts their conversation with a reminder for Angela about final exams During final exams Wayne s tutoring pays off as Angela very quietly sings the improvised lyrics to herself
Mr Tatum is surprised but Wayne smiles to himself glancing at Angela over his shoulder Angela goes to Wayne s house and finds him playing a saxophone and he shows a good deal of talent and ability at it
She s come to return some books he loaned her but she curiously asks who he plans to bring to prom
Wayne scoffs no girl would want to go to prom with him and he s too awkward to dance
Angela is very surprised at his explanation saying he knows a lot of songs
Although Wayne feels embarrassed at it Angela puts on the song Earth Angel and dances with Wayne helping him through it as he helped her with her history lessons
Wayne starts to feel better about himself as he follows Angela s lead and tells her about some of his future plans including working for the Peace Corps and becoming a UN Ambassador
But Wayne is still too embarrassed at the thought of attending prom until Angela insists he has likable qualities and if he sees a girl he really likes he has to take the plunge give her a kiss and ignore anyone else
But to Angela s surprise Wayne suddenly kisses her and asks her to be his prom date Riding with Duke to the prom Angela is trying to break the news that she s agreed to be Wayne s date
Duke is infuriated berating Angela and threatening to bust Wayne up
Refusing to listen to her admonishments to slow down as it s raining heavily Duke continues driving fast as he lashes out at Angela Another car is coming into a merge and despite its honking horn Duke doesn t notice until near the last second
He s forced to swerve and loses control of the car
Angela screams as the car careens off the road and plows straight into a tree Wayne checks his watch again as he stands alone on the dance floor holding a corsage for Angela
Everyone around him is dancing and enjoying the prom
Some football team members make fun of him surprised Wayne is even there
Judith tries to make her date leave Wayne alone
As she does this she carelessly mentions that Angela and Duke are running late
Wayne turns not understanding
He reveals that Angela had agreed to come to prom with him which of course is met with ridicule by most of the boys within earshot Everyone stops dancing and turns as Duke staggers in to the gym
He walks in a half daze diluted blood on his shirt
He rambles about the hospital trying to keep him for X rays and the car coming out of nowhere before he finally announces in tears that Angela died in the crash
All the students are stunned and shocked to hear it as Angela was the Prom Queen Wayne grabs Duke by his lapels demanding to know what he s done saying he s in love with Angela
Enraged Duke punches Wayne and knocks him to the floor spitting in a fury that Angela never liked him but just agreed to go with him because she felt sorry for him
Duke stalks off and Wayne pulls himself to his feet the corsage he bought for Angela slipping from his hands and falling to the gymnasium floor We see Angela still dressed up and made up for the prom picking up the corsage standing in the empty gymnasium
The gym glows with strange white light
The doors to the gym open more light shining from behind them
Angela walks through the doors and suddenly runs into Mr Tatum dressed in a Napoleon costume
He s as surprised as she is to find her there saying she died at least ten years before he did
Angela stares in disbelief as she learns that she s dead Mr
Tatum brings Angela into his office
She s in his personal version of heaven everyone gets their own
Pulling a file from his desk Mr Tatum sees that Angela s personal heaven would be an eternal night with James Dean
But Angela isn t guaranteed that heaven just yet
Mr Tatum reveals she s left unfinished business on Earth that she must complete and she has to find out by herself what that is before she can take care of it
If Angela fails to complete her mission she will return to the office for her personal hell detention with Mr Tatum forever It s 1990 and Judith recently dumped by her husband for a new younger woman has had to return to town from Wisconsin to stay with her father Norman Judith s teenage daughter Cindy in tow before completion of her senior year in high school
Judith has enrolled Cindy in the same high school she herself attended
Cindy is a relatively shy girl who s uncomfortable about having to leave behind all the friends she made in Wisconsin and unhappy about having had to pull up stakes and switch schools so close to graduation
Before she even gets out of her mother s pickup two girls walk by look at the lamb ranch logo on the door and mock Cindy by baaa ing like sheep
No sooner does she step out when a fancy red sports car drives into Angela s old spot and the driver a handsome young boy named Mike Darren who captains the school wrestling team hops out and promptly kisses one of the same two girls that mocked Cindy
Despite this Cindy gets an immediate crush on this heartthrob Looking for the history class room she s shown to it by a shy awkward young man named Peter which promptly draws mocking from varsity jocks
And if Cindy wasn t miserable enough already the teacher for history class is Wayne Stein now a cold angry embittered man nicknamed Flunken Stein by the students for the harsh uncompromising way he grades exams and papers
He gives a cold response to Cindy s attempted greeting as a new student as he readies to give the students a full written exam Judith brings her father to a car dealership to help her get a used car for Cindy
But Cindy is apathetic to the idea saying that having her own car won t change her life
Until they arrive back home and find Norman s portable freezer broken and when he brings it to a junk yard to sell it for scrap Cindy sees a car atop a scrap heap that she feels is perfect for her When fixed up the car is a beautiful if old bright blue Chevrolet Belair
Cindy is eager to take the car for her first spin but finds the radio dial seems to be stuck on an oldies station playing Earth Angel by The Penguins As fate would have it this is Angela s old car and suddenly Angela is sitting in the back seat
Cindy jumps out of the car and freaks out when Angela snaps her fingers and teleports right next to Cindy and her hands pass right through Cindy s body
Angela figures that Cindy is as good a person as any to help her figure out her mission back here on Earth
The first tough step is trying to break the ice with a disbelieving Cindy who still doesn t acknowledge Angela as real and refuses to listen to Angela s attempted advice aimed at making Cindy look and act cool
It starts to work when Angela puts her dark shades on Cindy and Mike driving by calls out Hey sexy
The next tough step is when Cindy arrives back home
Angela is amazed to see that Cindy s mother is Judith and runs toward her but Judith cannot see or hear Angela
Judith s amazement is the new car saying it looks just like the one her best friend in school drove
Cindy not yet realizing that she s the only one who can see hear and interact with Angela s spirit is amazed to see that Angela and Judith were former high school best friends and blurts it out loud
Seeing her mother s dumbfounded reaction Cindy decides she must simply be imagining Angela after all and pointedly ignores her as she does her homework in her room
Angela is trying to figure out why her former best friend can t see her but Cindy can she thinks that Cindy buying Angela s car must be what bonded the two if only she can re convince Cindy of that
Trying to make small talk Angela asks Cindy about Mike
Hearing Cindy complain of her social invisibility and hopelessness while Mike is the school dreamboat Angela jumps up with excitement
She s now sure her mission involves helping Cindy achieve social acceptance and status who better to help with this than a 1962 high school prom queen Angela takes Cindy to a mall to shop
She helps Cindy with a new hairstyle and outfit and tries to teach her how to strut which at first only succeeds in getting a wolf whistle from a parrot at a pet store where Peter works
Suddenly Cindy sees Mike walking by with one of his girlfriends on his arm
Angela starts to give a hurried pep talk and advice on how to get Mike to notice Cindy telling her that part of the act is to pretend she s bored and doesn t notice him
Cindy starts copying Angela s walk and Angela is able to turn Mike around
He gives a surprised impressed smile at Cindy before his girlfriend pulls him back around
Cindy is elated as for her this is bigger progress than she ever hoped for
Angela flashes a complacent smile and says that things are just starting In the next instant Angela is back in Mr Tatum s office and again she s smug saying she could have finished that mission in her sleep
But Mr Tatum tells Angela she s completely missed her mark wasting her time with Cindy
Moreover her mission has a deadline the date of Angela s death school prom night
Mr Tatum has no advice to offer Angela other than that she has to get to work or she ll be sitting before his desk in silence perfect posture for the rest of eternity Judith is going through want ads looking for a new job when the doorbell rings a new freezer is being delivered
Judith opens the door and is surprised to find Duke as the delivery man
Duke has been going by his legal first name Earl ever since finishing high school
He and Judith reconnect and catch up like Judith Duke is recently divorced though optimistic for a future marriage
Judith shows Duke a way through the house into the garage where the new freezer will go and they continue making small talk At school Cindy finds she s starting to get noticed and get attention from a number of the football jocks
This improves her self esteem and self confidence and she smiles as she walks through the halls to her next class
But she s still not rid of Angela who is now desperate she s found that Cindy isn t her mission but Cindy is still the only person who can see or hear Angela or otherwise be aware of her presence
However Cindy isn t overly sympathetic she still has school and all the assorted angst of teenage life to continue going through Angela follows Cindy into history class where Cindy is arriving late
Wayne is berating all the students over incorrect answers given on the exam
Angela finding Wayne s attitude too abrasive tears a small piece from one of the sheets of paper in Cindy s notebook makes a spitball and throws it at Wayne who suspects Cindy
Angela finally gets a close look at Wayne and is shocked to see what s become of him
She tells Cindy that Wayne was supposed to take her to prom which Cindy finds hard to believe
Forgetting nobody else can hear Angela she answers her by speaking Wayne s derogatory nickname of Flunkenstein out loud causing all the students to laugh
Wayne of course only gets very angry and orders Cindy out of the classroom suspending her and telling her that he wants to talk to her parents to make sure she s very sorry she crossed him
Wayne s reaction to Cindy leaves Angela completely crushed at how he s changed from the shy awkward young man who helped her to pass final exams Angela follows Cindy out she now believes that her mission is to help Wayne
The problem is Wayne can t see or hear Angela without Cindy
Of course Cindy is now less interested than ever at helping Angela after the trouble she s gotten in because of her Cindy despondently drives home trying to come up with a lie to explain her early arrival home from school
Angela is suddenly there trying to plead for help explaining how Wayne s heart was broken but Angela can t help him mend because he can t see or hear her
She offers to do anything in return for Cindy s help
Remembering Cindy s crush on Mike Angela offers to help set her up with him for the prom
She can listen in undetected on all his conversations learn when he s alone everything that can help Cindy get a date with him But Angela s idea to fix Wayne up with Judith outrages Cindy who is as yet unaware that Judith and Wayne knew each other in school as well
Angela swears to Cindy that she remembers Wayne as a very sweet and gentle young man anything other than the man monster that Cindy wouldn t want within a mile of her mother
Angela insists that love has to be the one thing that will bring out the Wayne she remembers a Wayne that nobody would fear Angela finds Wayne arriving at a restaurant in the evening where he moonlights as a saxophone player
Even though she knows he can t hear him she pours her heart out to him telling him to move on
Seeing his saxophone case and noting that he still plays music is a good sign in Angela s eyes The next day Judith arrives at the school to meet with Cindy s history teacher and is amazed to recognize Wayne
Although he seems somewhat pleased to see Judith again he dismissively says that she s not here to reminisce with him but to discuss the trouble that he believes Cindy has caused in class
Angela rails on Wayne as she listens even though he and Judith remain unaware of her presence
Judith tries to explain some of Cindy s troubles to Wayne who again is dismissive saying he had to impose disciplinary action on Cindy after she caused an incident in class Wayne continues working on papers as he speaks to Judith which irritates Angela
Remembering that she can manipulate some inanimate objects around her she pushes a stack of papers off Wayne s desk
As Judith tries to help Wayne pick them back up Angela pushes another stack
But this backfires as Wayne puts a foot down with Judith warning her that he can t be pushed around at school anymore now that he s a teacher and that both Cindy and Judith need to respect that for Cindy to pass
Without pausing for another breath Wayne dismisses Judith not even calling her by her first name That evening while making dinner Judith takes the foot Wayne put down with her and puts it back down with Cindy warning her that she needs to get a tutor for history
Judith talks about how she used to go to school with Wayne and he was a nobody back then playing bassoon in a Gilbert and Sullivan club
Hearing this Angela comes up with another plan
She starts by pushing over an open bottle of cooking oil causing the skillet on the stove that dinner is being cooked in to catch fire
Norman runs in with a fire extinguisher to put it out
Refusing to get upset over the incident Norman offers to take Judith and Cindy out for dinner This of course is at the Flaming Pit where Wayne plays saxophone with the band
Angela plans on making another go at bringing Wayne and Judith together here
As it happens the restaurant is getting short staffed prompting Judith to ask for a work application Angela gets Cindy to ask the hostess to put them right near where the band will play which Judith responds to with mild displeasure but the hostess assures them the band only plays on Friday and Saturday
Cindy and Angela exchange a look
Angela s plans of playing matchmaker have been foiled again The next day Cindy goes to see Peter at the mall asking him to help tutor her for history
She meets up again with the parrot who wolf whistled at her which Peter wants to buy as a pet for himself he works at the pet shop to save up the money it will cost to buy the bird
Cindy hopes to start the lessons that night but she can t bring Peter home for dinner because the stove was busted in the fire
But Peter says he knows a good spot Peter takes Cindy to a quiet area outside of town where an old style wooden covered bridge crosses a stream
As they talk over dumplings Cindy shares some memories of her life back on a sheep ranch in Wisconsin where she used to ice fish and had friends she could always rely on Angela arrives to tell Cindy that Mike is alone
Asking Cindy if she s sure she wants to go through with things Angela causes Peter to spill the container of take out Chinese food onto his jacket and shirt
As Peter goes to clean up at the stream Cindy comes up with an excuse to have to go once Peter returns Angela brings Cindy to a video store where Mike is
This time her maneuvering pays off as Mike notices Cindy and there s some brief flirting small talk before Mike asks Cindy for a date to take her to watch him and the wrestling team at a varsity match
Now all Angela needs is to try and make sure Judith has a date as well But as Cindy and Judith are getting ready a car horn honks to signal the arrival of the old high school friend that Judith insists she s not truly dating
Angela goes to the window and cries out in horror and outrage as she sees Duke
Duke being the reason Angela is now dead she s immediately dreading this turn of events fearing that Duke could bring disaster for Judith which would lead to eternal catastrophe for Angela
But when Angela begs Cindy to find a way to get Judith away from Duke Cindy just says she has to get to her date and leaves Fortunately for Angela Duke is the same old Duke and he starts coming onto Judith far too strong even pushing her down on the couch at his house trying to neck
When she pushes him away Duke thinks he just has to set the mood with some music and uses the remote for the stereo to play some
Angela quickly turns the manual volume dial up to maximum causing the stereo to blow knowing that Duke will be left holding the bag
Angela then turns on the egg beater and blender and then hits the master power switch for the house putting it in darkness
Duke gets the power back under control but by that time Judith is gone Cindy arrives home from her date riding on cloud nine
She had a great time watching Mike wrestle and he treated her like the Most Popular Girl in school which in turn caused most of the rest of the team to do the same
Mike even kissed her good night although when Angela asks if he asked her out for a second date Cindy realizes he didn t which frightens her that she might have really just been a one night stand
That s not even the bad news for Angela the school prom is in one week
She has to act really fast if she s going to help get Mike to ask Cindy to the prom Judith has gotten a job at the Flaming Pit
Her shift is just ending when Wayne comes in
The two of them are surprised to see each other there Judith just finding out that Wayne works in the restaurant on Friday and Saturday nights
Trying to make small talk Judith mentions that Cindy is being tutored and is starting to speak well of Wayne but Wayne takes the news with cynicism and even contempt brushing past Judith rudely
To keep Judith from leaving too soon Angela makes her drop the small basket holding her share of tips
Judith is just turning in the basket to the cashier for counting and recording when the band starts playing and Judith turns around shocked to see Wayne on the saxophone
But as beautifully as Wayne plays Judith looks at him with scorn calling it a waste before leaving Peter and Cindy are studying together when Peter notices Cindy is distracted
In fact however Angela is arriving with news Mike is at the mall Angela discretely coaches Cindy as she hangs out with Mike some of the varsity jocks and their girlfriends
A big pre prom party is being planned and Mike suddenly says if Cindy goes he ll take her to the prom
He asks if the party can be held at Cindy s house
Cindy first says she ll ask her mom if it s okay but Angela tells her that s not a good enough answer so Cindy says yes the party can be at her place Duke comes to bring flowers and an apology to Judith
Despite Judith s reluctance Duke manages to find the right words to say so that Judith agrees to see him again Angela takes the news much harder than Cindy
Cindy doesn t know much about Duke but she knows that her mother and Wayne aren t getting along
She feels bad about Angela s impending fate but insists she s done her part trying to help get Wayne and Judith together
Despite how Angela remembers Wayne Cindy feels he s just changed and that the old Wayne who Angela took a liking to is gone But Angela refuses to believe this
She goes to Wayne s house at night while he s practicing
The music he plays on his saxophone is beautiful and heart warming and Angela knows that the old Wayne is still there
Angela pulls on one of the saxophone s keys to make Wayne stop playing and pleads with him passionately
As Wayne starts to look at his reflection in a Window Angela sees the pain in his eyes and face
Angela repeats what she told Wayne in that same room back in 1962 to grab her and kiss her and don t be afraid what anyone thinks to let go of the past and move on
His face looking haunted Wayne says Judith s name
Angela starts to cry with joy Cindy is going to her locker with two other girls she s befriended thanks to Mike s influence
Peter asks Cindy if she wants to study for finals
Cindy tries to be polite in saying she thinks she s okay now as far as history class goes but the girls with Cindy are more brusque telling Peter that Cindy has other plans for the night
Mike comes up at that moment touching Cindy on the shoulder
Peter understands that Cindy is going to a pre prom party and asks what time it is
This leads to Cindy s friends and Mike both giving Peter a sharp reminder of the school s social pecking order and where Peter stands in it
Cindy feels uncomfortable at this but doesn t resist as Mike leads her and the other girls away Judith is again finishing her shift at the restaurant when Wayne comes in for his
Judith gives him a polite perfunctory greeting before continuing on her way
Angela has to discreetly pull Judith back twice to make her think that Wayne has something to say
Fumbling with his words for a moment Wayne finally asks if he can take Judith for a drink after work
This time however it s Judith who gives Wayne a brush off saying she already has a date
Angela is more distraught than ever but suddenly she gives a sly smile her face lighting up with another idea before she teleports out of the restaurant Duke is driving down the road when his car gets a flat tire
As his car comes to a stop Angela punctures all his other tires so he has four flats Back at the restaurant Judith is still waiting for Duke to show as Wayne plays with the band
She applauds politely as the band finishes a number
Wayne looks up and sees Judith sitting at the bar and goes to her
They start to break the ice between them reminiscing about their time as schoolmates
Judith admits she likes Wayne s music he thought of being a professional musician but ended up detoured by the twists of life something Judith understands very well from her recent divorce Wayne starts to clumsily ask Judith if he can bring her to the school prom where he will be acting as an adult chaperone
But before he can finish the bar s phone rings and the bartender tells Judith that some guy is on the phone asking for her At a pay phone in a bar Duke has just enough time for Judith to recognize his voice when Angela disconnects the call
As he tries to place another call Angela picks his pocket taking one of his business cards and a number of bills from his wallet and discreetly passing them to a prostitute in the bar
As Duke gets back on the phone with Judith and starts to tell her that his car got a flat but he s on his way to pick her up the prostitute saunters up to Duke smiling and tries to pick HIM up
Judith overhears this of course and moreover Duke is more than distracted enough by the prostitute to clumsily ask for a rain check for the following evening and hang up again Judith turns back to Wayne who starts to repeat his invitation but Judith tells him she d love to go without even needing to hear the whole thing again Pleased with herself Angela snaps her fingers to teleport back to the Flaming Pit but finds herself back in Mr Tatum s office again
Angela has it out with Mr Tatum adamantly defending her actions with both Judith and Cindy saying that Cindy is with her dream boy
Finally Mr Tatum puts Angela back in her place with a dire warning that Angela s meddling has put Cindy down the same road that led to Angela s death back in 1962
Now Cindy is in danger and this means that Angela is in even more serious danger Angela finds herself back at Cindy s house where the party is going full swing and Cindy is kissing Mike on the couch
Angela stops the stereo so that Mike gets up to fix it and then threatens to haunt the party unless Cindy goes to talk with her in private Angela understands now that she s re created the same triangle as back in 1962 with Cindy as Angela Mike as Duke and Peter as Wayne
Mike is no more Cindy s real friend much less love interest as Duke had been to Angela
Cindy had one real friend in Peter but now she has no true friends just a place at the top of the school social ladder that she s bound to topple down from
Of course Cindy doesn t want to hear it
Going back to the nobody that everyone laughed at and made fun of is the last thing she s willing to consider
Considering her business with Angela finished Cindy demands Angela leave her alone The next morning Cindy and Judith are with Norman at home when the doorbell rings
Judith answers and tells Cindy it s for her
Sitting on the doorstep is a bird cage with Lucille the parrot Peter was saving up to buy a note on the cage with Cindy s name and the parrot s been trained to express Peter s feelings for Cindy But when Cindy brings the parrot back to the pet shop berating Peter for trying to make her feel guilty Peter is even angrier than she is Lucille was stolen from the pet shop and Peter now thinks Cindy was responsible as part of some prank on him
Peter and Cindy have it out over how she s changed in a way that Peter doesn t like at all
Cindy is taken aback that Peter didn t send the bird to her but it takes her only a second to figure out who did
She starts to storm out to find Angela only to find Angela s already there
Cindy berates Angela over the trick asking if sending her the parrot would change anything It s changed something for sure Mike happens to be walking by overhears and thinks that Peter sent Cindy a present which Mike takes as a direct challenge
He stomps over to Peter and floors him with a vicious punch bloodying Peter s nose
He s about to hit him again when Angela grabs a chewy dog bone whacks Mike over the back of the head and then quickly puts the bone in Cindy s hand
Cindy gets a taste of Mike s true colors as he starts ordering her around as his girl warning her that she s not to give him any lip
Challenging him on whether he s going to beat her up the way he was going to do to Peter Cindy tells Mike to get away
But before he leaves he demands Cindy be at the tux shop in five minutes Cindy apologizes to Peter and begs him to forgive her
Although he cracks a joke that she s already late to the tux shop he says that he can
Cindy sees Peter not as a geek but a wonderful young man
As they look into each other s eyes Cindy suddenly stuns Peter by asking him to the prom
Slowly they lean in and kiss It s raining as Cindy leaves the mall and Mike is waiting
His demand that she get into the passenger seat of her car sounds like a threat and getting intimidated she complies In the car Cindy and Mike fall into an argument eerily reminiscent of the one between Duke and Angela
Mike is outraged at being dumped for the prom in favor of Peter threatening to bust him just as Duke threatened to do to Wayne The car nears the same merge where Angela met her fate and another car comes cruising down honking loudly and forcing Mike to swerve
The car starts to careen out of control heading toward the same tree
But this time a guardian angel for Cindy is there Angela grabs the steering wheel with a panicked cry guiding the car to a skidding stop away from the tree and off the road This is the last straw for Cindy and she demands Mike get out of the car rain or no rain
As Mike gets out he yells a warning and a threat that if Cindy shows up at the prom with Peter then not only will he regret it but so will she As Mike storms off Cindy catches her breath and is ready to own up to her mistakes in front of Angela but she finds that Angela is suddenly gone
Cindy is alone in the car Judith s doorbell rings and she comes downstairs in a beautiful dress only to find Duke there with a bottle of wine as an apology present thinking he can simply pick up with Judith where he left off
Trying to explain the previous night he starts fabricating a ridiculous story about saving the life of a young woman starting to have a heart attack at the bar he d gotten to after his flat tire He only gets partway through it when Wayne shows up in a tuxedo to take his girl to the prom
Duke is shocked at this at history repeating himself
Speaking with a lot of self confidence Wayne throws Duke s line from 1962 right back at him that Judith just felt sorry for him Wayne and Judith arrive at the prom
Wayne goes up to the band that s entertaining and whispers in the saxophonist s ear
The saxophone player nods and gives his saxophone to Wayne who picks up the number with ease
All the students applaud enthusiastically at seeing this side of their history teacher that they d never seen before
Even Mike waiting impatiently and fruitlessly for Cindy raises his eyebrows in surprise
When the number is finished Wayne whispers to the saxophone player again as he returns the instrument
The band begins playing Earth Angel as Wayne steps off stage and he and Judith dance along with the rest of the students The camera pans out from the prom and shifts to the covered bridge where Cindy dances with Peter to the music from her car radio both dressed in prom finery
Peter notices that Cindy is again distracted and asks if something is the matter Cindy happens to look up and sees Angela dancing on a cloud with James Dean
She smiles at Peter and tells him that everything is perfect
Angela has succeeded at her mission and has her personal heaven an eternal night with James Dean
And Cindy has her dream prom with the true boy of her dreams
Angela looks down at Cindy smiling and winking
Cindy smiles back and then at Peter before she leans in and kisses him The movie closes with Angela still dancing on the cloud before she and her dream date slowly fade out of view

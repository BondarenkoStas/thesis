Farmer Jabez Stone from the small town of Cross Corners New Hampshire is plagued with unending bad luck causing him to finally swear it s enough to make a man want to sell his soul to the devil
Stone is visited the next day by a stranger who later identifies himself as Mr Scratch and makes such an offer in exchange for seven years of prosperity
Stone agrees
After seven years Mr Scratch comes for Stone s soul
Stone bargains for an additional three years after the additional three years passes Mr Scratch refuses any further extension
Wanting out of the deal Stone convinces famous lawyer and orator Daniel Webster to accept his case
At midnight of the appointed date Mr Scratch arrives and is greeted by Webster presenting himself as Stone s attorney
Mr Scratch tells Webster I shall call upon you as a law abiding citizen to assist me in taking possession of my property and so begins the argument
It goes poorly for Webster since the signature and the contract are clear and Mr Scratch will not compromise
In desperation Webster thunders Mr Stone is an American citizen and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince
We fought England for that in 12 and we ll fight all hell for it again
To this Mr Scratch insists on his citizenship citing his presence at the worst events of the US concluding though I don t like to boast of it my name is older in this country than yours
Webster demands a trial as the right of every American
Mr Scratch agrees after Webster says that he can select the judge and jury so long as it is an American judge and an American jury
A jury of the damned then enters with the fires of hell still upon them
They had all done evil and had all played a part in the formation of the United States Walter Butler a Loyalist Simon Girty a Loyalist King Philip Governor Thomas Dale Thomas Morton a rival of the Plymouth Pilgrims The pirate Edward Teach also known as Blackbeard Reverend John Smeet After five other unnamed jurors enter the judge enters last John Hathorne the infamous and unrepentant executor of the Salem witch trials
The trial is rigged against Webster
He is ready to rage without care for himself or Stone but he catches himself he sees in the jurors eyes that they want him to act thus
He calms himself for it was him they d come for not only Jabez Stone
Webster starts to orate on simple and good things the freshness of a fine morning the taste of food when you re hungry the new day that s every day when you re a child and how without freedom they sickened
He speaks passionately of how wonderful it is to be human and to be an American
He admits the wrongs done in the course of American history but points out that something new and good had grown from them and that everybody had played a part in it even the traitors
Mankind got tricked and trapped and bamboozled but it was a great journey something no demon that was ever foaled could ever understand
The jury announces its verdict We find for the defendant Jabez Stone
They admit Perhaps tis not strictly in accordance with the evidence but even the damned may salute the eloquence of Mr
Webster
The judge and jury disappear with the break of dawn
Mr Scratch congratulates Webster and the contract is torn up
Webster then grabs the stranger and twists his arm behind his back for he knew that once you bested anybody like Mr Scratch in fair fight his power on you was gone
Webster makes him agree never to bother Jabez Stone nor his heirs or assigns nor any other New Hampshire man till doomsday
Mr Scratch offers to tell Webster s fortune in his palm
He foretells Webster s failure to become President the death of Webster s sons and the backlash of his last speech warning Some will call you Ichabod
Scratch predicts actual events of Daniel Webster s life he did have ambitions to become President his sons died in war and as a result of the Seventh of March Speech many in the North considered Webster a traitor
Webster takes the predictions in stride and asks only if the Union will prevail
Scratch reluctantly admits that although a war will be fought over the issue the United States will remain united
Webster then laughs And with that he drew back his foot for a kick that would have stunned a horse
It was only the tip of his shoe that caught the stranger but he went flying out of the door with his collecting box under his arm
It is said that the Devil never did come back to New Hampshire
The story then ends with Jabez Stone moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina where he found a new wife and had three children Samantha Alex and Alfie

During a period of sluggish economy and high unemployment four friends Stone Tony Dan and Rockney gather for a fishing trip
The weekend getaway is a cover they are really planning to fly to Colombia to rob a drug lord
They meet with Clint who supplies them with weapons and target practice
It becomes clear that with the exception of Stone the men have no relevant training and are not taking the heist seriously
The men are flown to a jungle
Their target is Serrano a sadistic drug lord who lives in a large villa
The group observes Serrano his staff and various visitors from a hidden vantage point
They discuss whether they would have the courage to actually kill someone and what they will do with their share of the cash once they return home
They infiltrate the villa capture Serrano and his lover and force Serrano to reveal the combination to his safe
They escape from the villa with five million dollars in cash
They travel on foot through the jungle eventually finding horses to buy
Believing that they have been successful the men camp for the night and celebrate
They are unaware that they are being observed by a rebel tracker
When they wake the next day Serrano s men and the local military are approaching them in all terrain vehicles and on horseback
They flee but Tony and Rockney are captured by Serrano
Stone and Dan have to continue on foot and only escape their pursuers by leaping from very high rope bridge
Serrano has Rockney beaten to force Tony to reveal the location of money
Knowing that Stone has his share of the cash and that they face better odds of escape in the open Tony agrees to show them where the money is hidden
Serrano has them taken to a prison
They meet Olivia the prisoner in the neighboring cell who claims she was falsely arrested
Tony bribes a passing child to pull out the barred window of their cell with a tow truck
The child demands their clothes in payment also and they are pursued virtually naked through the town
They lose their pursuers in a bordello
Dressed in women s clothes Tony and Rockney make their way to a bus station and reunite with Olivia
They travel together to the rendezvous point
Dan and Stone are captured by a local rebel leader General Mariano who wants the stolen money for himself
They escape then turn and track the rebels until nightfall
They are forced to kill several of the rebels before they retrieve the cash
The rebels pursue them to the rendezvous point where they expect to be airlifted to safety
Dan is wounded by Mariano s tracker
In the ensuing firefight Tony is shot trying to protect Stone
Believing Tony is dead the others continue to the airstrip without him
Serrano s mercenaries have arrived ahead of them and a three way gun battle ensues
Serrano s men subdue the rebels
The retrieval plane arrives and provides covering fire scattering Serrano s men
The plane lands the team boards hurriedly and they make their escape
They are celebrating their success when the engine stalls

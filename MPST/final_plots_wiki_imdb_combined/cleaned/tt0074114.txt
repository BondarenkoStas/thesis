While leaving her husband whom she has grown to despise Alice drives into the pristine countryside but must stop at an old house after her windshield cracks mysteriously
An old man and his butler welcome her at the mansion as if she were expected
The old man insists on her staying overnight
They even offer to have her car repaired in the morning
She is woken up in the middle of the night by a booming noise
The next day the car is there with a new windshield but she is alone in the deserted house
After a good breakfast laid out for her she jumps into the car again but she cannot find the gateway to the country house from whence she came
A tree trunk seems to be in the way
Reluctantly she returns to the old house
She then tries to walk the way with her suitcase and she meets a young man who tells her to accept the fact that there is no way out
Is she in limbo
She has to spend a second night in the mansion
The old man is there again and provides some explanations
The following day is a bright morning full of birdsong
Once more breakfast is ready for her in the lonely house
She takes the car again and here is the path and the gate to the highway
Is she really out
A few more strange characters come her way
Her windshield cracks again

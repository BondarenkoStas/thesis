Place Near the seat of the Grail Act 1 In a forest near the home of the Grail and its Knights Gurnemanz eldest Knight of the Grail wakes his young squires and leads them in prayer
He sees Amfortas King of the Grail Knights and his entourage approaching
Amfortas has been injured by his own Holy Spear and the wound will not heal
Vorspiel About 14 minutes
Scene 1 Gurnemanz asks the lead Knight for news of the King s health
The Knight says the King has suffered during the night and is going early to bathe in the holy lake
The squires ask Gurnemanz to explain how the King s injury can be healed but he evades their question and a wild woman Kundry bursts in
She gives Gurnemanz a vial of balsam brought from Arabia to ease the King s pain and then collapses exhausted
Amfortas arrives borne on a stretcher by Knights of the Grail
He calls out for Gawain whose attempt at relieving the King s pain had failed
He is told that Gawain has left again seeking a better remedy
Raising himself somewhat the King says going off without leave is the sort of impulsiveness which led himself into Klingsor s realm and to his downfall
He accepts the potion from Gurnemanz and tries to thank Kundry but she answers abruptly that thanks will not help and urges him onward to his bath
The procession leaves
The squires eye Kundry with mistrust and question her
After a brief retort she falls silent
Gurnemanz tells them Kundry has often helped the Grail Knights but that she comes and goes unpredictably
When he asks directly why she does not stay to help she answers I never help

The squires think she is a witch and sneer that if she does so much why will she not find the Holy Spear for them
Gurnemanz reveals that this deed is destined for someone else
He says Amfortas was given guardianship of the Spear but lost it as he was seduced by an irresistibly attractive woman in Klingsor s domain
Klingsor grabbed the Spear and stabbed Amfortas
The wound causes Amfortas both suffering and shame and will never heal on its own
Squires returning from the King s bath tell Gurnemanz that the balsam has eased the King s suffering
Gurnemanz s own squires ask how it is that he knew Klingsor
He solemnly tells them how both the Holy Spear which pierced the side of the Redeemer on the Cross and the Holy Grail which caught the flowing blood had come to Monsalvat to be guarded by the Knights of the Grail under the rule of Titurel father of Amfortas
Klingsor had yearned to join the Knights but unable to keep impure thoughts from his mind resorted to self castration causing him to be expelled from the Order
Klingsor then set himself up in opposition to the realm of the Grail learning dark arts claiming the valley domain below and filling it with beautiful Flowermaidens to seduce and enthrall wayward Grail Knights
It was here that Amfortas lost the Holy Spear kept by Klingsor as he schemes to get hold of the Grail as well
Gurnemanz tells how Amfortas later had a holy vision which told him to wait for a pure fool enlightened by compassion who will finally heal the wound
At this moment cries are heard from the Knights a flying swan has been shot and a young man is brought forth a bow in his hand and a quiver of matching arrows
Gurnemanz speaks sternly to the lad saying this is a holy place
He asks him outright if he shot the swan and the lad boasts that if it flies he can hit it Gurnemanz tells him that the swan is a holy animal and asks what harm the swan had done him and shows the youth its lifeless body
Now remorseful the young man breaks his bow and casts it aside
Gurnemanz asks him why he is here who his father is how he found this place and lastly his name
To each question the lad replies I don t know
The elder Knight sends his squires away to help the King and now asks the boy to tell what he does know
The young man says he has a mother Herzeleide and that he made the bow himself
Kundry has been listening and now tells them that this boy s father was Gamuret a knight killed in battle and also how the lad s mother had forbidden her son to use a sword fearing that he would meet the same fate as his father
The youth now recalls that upon seeing knights pass through his forest he had left his home and mother to follow them
Kundry laughs and tells the young man that as she rode by she saw Herzeleide die of grief
Hearing this the lad first lunges at Kundry but then collapses in grief
Kundry herself is now weary for sleep but cries out that she must not sleep and wishes that she might never again waken
She disappears into the undergrowth
Gurnemanz knows that the Grail draws only the pious to Monsalvat and invites the boy to observe the Grail rite
The youth does not know what the Grail is but remarks that as they walk he seems to scarcely move yet feels as if he is traveling far
Gurnemanz says that in this realm time becomes space
Verwandlungsmusik An orchestral interlude of about 4 minutes
Scene 2 They arrive at the Hall of the Grail where the Knights are assembling to receive Holy Communion
The voice of Titurel is heard telling his son Amfortas to uncover the Grail
Amfortas is wracked with shame and suffering
He is the guardian of these holy relics yet has succumbed to temptation and lost the Spear
He declares himself unworthy of his office
He cries out for forgiveness but hears only the promise that he will one day be redeemed by the pure fool
On hearing Amfortas cry the youth appears to suffer with him clutching at his heart
The knights and Titurel urge Amfortas to reveal the Grail and he finally does
The dark hall is now bathed in the light of the Grail as the Knights eat
Gurnemanz motions to the youth to participate but he seems entranced and does not
Amfortas does not share in taking communion and as the ceremony ends collapses in pain and is carried away
Slowly the hall empties leaving only the young man and Gurnemanz who asks him if he has understood what he has seen
When the lad cannot answer Gurnemanz dismisses him as just a fool and sends him out with a warning to hunt geese if he must but to leave the swans alone
A voice from high above repeats the promise The pure fool enlightened by compassion
Act 2 Scene 1 Klingsor s magic castle
Klingsor conjures up Kundry waking her from her sleep
He calls her by many names First Sorceress Hell s Rose Herodias Gundryggia and lastly Kundry
She is now transformed into an incredibly alluring woman as when she once seduced Amfortas
She mocks Klingsor s mutilated condition by sarcastically inquiring if he is chaste but she cannot resist his power
Klingsor observes that Parsifal is approaching and summons his enchanted knights to fight the boy
Klingsor watches as Parsifal overcomes his knights and they flee
Klingsor wishes destruction on their whole race
Klingsor sees this young man stray into his Flowermaiden garden and calls to Kundry to seek the boy out and seduce him but when he turns he sees that Kundry has already left on her mission
Scene 2 The triumphant youth finds himself in a wondrous garden surrounded by beautiful and seductive Flowermaidens
They call to him and entwine themselves about him while chiding him for wounding their lovers
They soon fight and bicker among themselves to win his devotion to the point that he is about to flee but then a voice calls out Parsifal
He now recalls this name is what his mother called him when she appeared in his dreams
The Flowermaidens back away from him and call him a fool as they leave him and Kundry alone
Parsifal wonders if the Garden is a dream and asks how it is that Kundry knows his name
Kundry tells him she learned it from his mother who had loved him and tried to shield him from his father s fate the mother he had abandoned and who had finally died of grief
She reveals many parts of Parsifal s history to him and he is stricken with remorse blaming himself for his mother s death
He thinks himself very stupid to have forgotten her
Kundry says this realization is a first sign of understanding and that with a kiss she can help him understand his mother s love
As they kiss Parsifal suddenly recoils in pain and cries out Amfortas name he feels the wounded king s pain burning in his own side and now understands Amfortas passion during the Grail Ceremony
Filled with this compassion Parsifal rejects Kundry s advances
Furious that her ploy has failed Kundry tells Parsifal that if he can feel compassion for Amfortas then he should be able to feel it for her as well
She has been cursed for centuries unable to rest because she saw Christ on the cross and laughed at His pains
Now she can never weep only jeer and she is enslaved to Klingsor as well
Parsifal rejects her again but then asks her to lead him to Amfortas
She begs him to stay with her for just one hour and then she will take him to Amfortas
When he still refuses she curses him to wander without ever finding the Kingdom of the Grail and finally calls on her master Klingsor to help her
Klingsor appears and throws the Spear at Parsifal but it stops in midair above his head
Parsifal takes it and makes the sign of the Cross with it
The castle crumbles and the enchanted garden withers
As Parsifal leaves he tells Kundry that she knows where she can find him
Act 3 Vorspiel About 5 minutes
Scene 1 The scene is the same as that of the opening of the opera in the domain of the Grail but many years later
Gurnemanz is now aged and bent
It is Good Friday
He hears moaning near his hermit s hut and discovers Kundry unconscious in the brush as he had many years before
He revives her using water from the Holy Spring but she will only speak the word serve
Gurnemanz wonders if there is any significance to her reappearance on this special day
Looking into the forest he sees a figure approaching armed and in full armour
The stranger wears a helmet and the hermit cannot see who it is
Gurnemanz queries him and chides him for being armed on sanctified ground and on a holy day but gets no response
Finally the apparition removes the helmet and Gurnemanz recognizes the lad who shot the swan and joyfully sees that he bears the Holy Spear
Parsifal tells of his desire to return to Amfortas
He relates his long journey how he wandered for years unable to find a path back to the Grail
He had often been forced to fight but never wielded the Spear in battle
Gurnemanz tells him that the curse preventing Parsifal from finding his right path has now been lifted but that in his absence Amfortas has never unveiled the Grail and lack of its sustaining properties has caused the death of Titurel
Parsifal is overcome with remorse blaming himself for this state of affairs
Gurnemanz tells him that today is the day of Titurel s funeral and that Parsifal has a great duty to perform
Kundry washes Parsifal s feet and Gurnemanz anoints him with water from the Holy Spring recognizing him as the pure fool now enlightened by compassion and as the new King of the Knights of the Grail
Parsifal looks about and comments on the beauty of the meadow
Gurnemanz explains that today is Good Friday when all the world is renewed
Parsifal baptizes the weeping Kundry
Tolling bells are heard in the distance
Gurnemanz says Midday the hour has come
My lord permit your servant to guide you
and all three set off for the castle of the Grail
A dark orchestral interlude leads into the solemn gathering of the knights
Scene 2 Within the castle of the Grail Amfortas is brought before the Grail shrine and Titurel s coffin
He cries out asking his dead father to grant him rest from his sufferings and expresses the desire to join him in death
The Knights of the Grail passionately urge Amfortas to uncover the Grail again but Amfortas in a frenzy says he will never again show the Grail
He commands the Knights instead to kill him and end his suffering and the shame he has brought on the Knighthood
At this moment Parsifal steps forth and says that only one weapon can heal the wound
He touches Amfortas side with the Spear and both heals and absolves him
Parsifal commands the unveiling of the Grail
As all present kneel Kundry released from her curse sinks lifeless to the ground as a white dove descends and hovers above Parsifal

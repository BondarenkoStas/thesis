The cellar resembles a cave with only one small window to illuminate its dank recesses
In a corner thin boards partition off the room of Vaska the young thief
In the kitchen live Kvashnya a vendor of meat pies the decrepit Baron and the streetwalker Nastya
All around the room are bunks occupied by other lodgers
Nastya her head bent down is absorbed in reading a novel titled Fatal Love
The Baron who lives largely on Nastya s earnings seizes the book and reads its title aloud
Then he bangs Nastya over the head with it and calls her a lovesick fool
Satine raises himself painfully from his bunk at the noise
His memory is vague but he knows he took a beating the night before and the others tell him he had been caught cheating at cards
The Actor stirs in his bed on top of the stove
He predicts that some day Satine will be beaten to death
The Actor reminds the Baron to sweep the floor
The landlady is strict and makes them clean every day
The Baron loudly announces that he has to go shopping he and Kvashnya leave to make the day s purchases
The Actor climbs down from his bunk and declares that the doctor has told him he has an organism poisoned by alcohol and sweeping the floor would be bad for his health
Anna coughs loudly in her bunk
She is dying of consumption there is no hope for her
Her husband Kleshtch is busy at his bench where he fits old keys and locks
Anna sits up and calls to Kleshtch offering him the dumplings that Kvashnya has left for her in the pot
Kleshtch agrees that there is no use feeding a dying woman and so with a clear conscience he eats the dumplings
The Actor helps Anna down from her high bed and out into the drafty hall
The sick woman is wrapped in rags
As they go through the door the landlord Kostilyoff enters nearly knocking them down
Kostilyoff looks around the dirty cellar and glances several times at Kleshtch working at his bench
Loudly the landlord says that the locksmith occupies too much room for two rubles a month and that henceforth the rent will be two and one half rubles
Then Kostilyoff edges toward Vaska s room and inquires furtively if his wife has been in
Kostilyoff has good reason to suspect that his wife Vassilisa is sleeping with Vaska
At last Kostilyoff gets up the courage to call out to Vaska
The thief comes out of his room and denounces the landlord for not paying his debts saying that Kostilyoff still owes seven rubles for a watch he had bought
Ordering Kostilyoff to produce the money immediately Vaska sends him roughly out of the room
The others admire Vaska for his courage and urge him to kill Kostilyoff and marry Vassilisa then he could be landlord
Vaska thinks the idea over for a time but decides that he is too softhearted to be a landlord
Besides he is thinking of discarding Vassilisa for her sister Natasha
Satine asks Vaska for twenty kopecks which the thief is glad to give he is afraid Satine will want a ruble next
Natasha comes in with the tramp Luka
She puts him in the kitchen to sleep with the three already there
Luka a merry fellow begins to sing but he stops when all the others object
The whole group sits silent when Vassilisa comes in sees the dirty floor and gives orders for an immediate sweeping
She looks over the new arrival Luka and asks to see his passport
Because he has none he is more readily accepted by the others
Miedviedeff who is a policeman and Vassilisa s uncle enters the cellar to check up on the lodging
He begins to question Luka but when the tramp calls him sergeant Miedviedeff leaves him alone
That night Anna lies in her bunk while a noisy quarrelsome card game goes on
Luka talks gently to the consumptive woman and Kleshtch comes from time to time to look at her
Luka remarks that her death will be hard on her husband but Anna accuses Kleshtch of causing her death
She says that she looks forward to the rest and peace she has never known
Luka assures her she will be at peace after her death
The card players become louder and Satine is accused of cheating
Luka quiets the riotous players they all respect him even though they think him a liar
He tells Vaska that he will be able to reform in Siberia and he assures the Actor that at a sanatorium he could be cured of alcoholism
Vassilisa comes in and when the others leave she offers Vaska three hundred rubles if he will kill Kostilyoff and set her free
That would leave Vaska free to marry Natasha who at the moment is recovering from a beating given to her by her jealous sister
Vaska is about to refuse when Kostilyoff enters in search of his wife
He is extremely suspicious but Vaska pushes him out of the cellar
A noise on top of the stove reveals that Luka has overheard everything
He is not greatly disturbed and warns Vaska not to have anything to do with the vicious Vassilisa
Walking over to Anna s bunk Luka sees that she is dead
They find Kleshtch at the saloon and he comes to look at the body of his dead wife
The others tell him that he will have to remove the body because in time dead people smell
Kleshtch agrees to take Anna s body outside
The Actor begins to cavort in joy talking excitedly
He has made up his mind to go to the sanatorium for his health
Luka has told him that he can even be cured at state expense
In the backyard that night as Natasha is telling romantic stories to the crowd Kostilyoff comes out and gruffly orders her in to work
As she goes in Vassilisa pours boiling water on Natasha s feet
Vaska attempts to rescue her and knocks Kostilyoff down and in the ensuing brawl Kostilyoff is killed
As the others slink away Vassilisa immediately accuses Vaska of murder
Natasha thinks that Vaska has murdered Kostilyoff for the sake of Vassilisa
Natasha is almost in delirium as she wanders about accusing Vaska of murder and calling for revenge
She says to always keep the odds out of even and not to trouble the trouble until trouble troubles someone
Sensing trouble Luka disappears and is never seen again
Vaska escapes a police search
Natasha is put to the hospital
The rest of the down and outers continue with their daily chores much like before
Satine cheats at cards and the Baron tries to convince the others of his former affluence
They all agree that Luka was a kind old man but a great liar
During a bitter quarrel with Nastya the Baron steps out in the yard
Satine and the others strike up a bawdy song but they break off when the Baron bursts in with the news of Actor s suicide to which Satine quite without compassion coldly retorts You spoiled the song you idiot

The lead character of the series Nico Bonetti is a policeman from New York City who is proud of his Italian heritage and very fond of his vintage rose colored Cadillac convertible which he inherited from his father
After he erroneously shoots a young girl during a gunfight he relocates to a beachfront Los Angeles precinct on temporary assignment
Here he meets his new partners Tequila and Officer Angela Garcia who joined the department after her policeman husband s death
Their boss is Captain Midian Knight who is almost as interested in selling a screenplay as he is in police work
The series shows their investigations of crimes and the evolving relationships between the characters
This show has the peculiarity that television viewers are able to hear Tequila s thoughts
Life is not easy for Bonetti due to his remorse about the girl he shot and the strange habits of Californians whom he does not understand
His neighbors include a Puerto Rican psychic who hears Tequila s thoughts but initially believes she is hearing spirits
Bonetti develops a grudging respect for the people around him as well as for Tequila who despite his faults is an excellent police dog
The dog is portrayed as having human level intelligence and a street wise sassy attitude
The show was developed by producer Donald P Bellisario
His daughter Troian Bellisario had a recurring role as Garcia s daughter who for a time is unaware that her mother has joined the police department rather than continue a career as an art dealer
Each episode has a montage during which Bonetti plays piano and viewers see odd sometimes disturbing scenes featuring Bonetti s neighbors and co workers
Some of these scenes are from later episodes while others remain unexplained
Each montage ends with Bonetti s memory of the shooting of the girl in New York

The film is set in Japan in 1885 alternating largely between Tokyo and Osaka
Kikunosuke Onoe generally called Kiku played by the stage actor Shotaro Hanayagi is the adopted son of a famous Kabuki actor who is training to succeed his father in an illustrious career
Whilst hypocritically praising Onoe s acting to his face the rest of his father s troupe deride him behind his back
Otoku who lives at the father s house as the young wet nurse of the infant son of the father s natural son is the only one frank enough to disclose his artistic shortcomings and urge him to improve himself
When Otoku is dismissed by Kiku s family for her over closeness to the young master with the potential for scandal Kiku tracks her down and states that he wishes to marry her
His family is outraged and Kiku is forced to leave Tokyo taking the train to Nagoya honing his art away from his father much to the latter s wrath
The story jumps by a year
Kiku is acting alongside his uncle Tamiro Naritaya in Osaka but remains dissatisfied and wishes to join a travelling troupe
Then Otoku tracks down Kiku and re inspires him
She becomes his common law wife and continues to encourage him
When his uncle dies four years later he decides to join a travelling troupe and their times together become even harder
A further four years pass and we see Kiku and Otuko on the road their fellow actors squabbling over small amounts of money
Kiku has changed in character to the point where he even strikes Otuko
She still loves him but his love has clearly faded
Their position worsens and Otoku becomes very sick
Otoku goes to meet Kiku s brother to beg that he be given an acting role in Tokyo re using the famous family name
He agrees that Kiku can play the part he was due to play on two conditions one that his acting has improved two that he and Otuko split as this is needed to reconcile with their father
Fuku returns with Otoku to fetch Kiku
We then see Kiku on stage giving a bravura performance of Sumizome a difficult and critical female role
He has at last found his niche and the fame he had always sought as a Kabuki actor
Otoku watches sadly from the wings but she is happy for him
The family agree that Kiku may perform in Tokyo
As Kiku boards the train to Tokyo Otoku cannot be found and Fuku hands him a letter from her explaining everything
His companions explain that paradoxically he must continue to Tokyo in order to make Otoku s sacrifice worth while
He is a success
The Tokyo troupe visit Osaka and have a triumphant welcome
Kiku s father says that Kiku may take pride of place in the river parade after the performance
Otuko s father comes and tells Kiku that she is ill and will die that night
Kiku hesitates as it is his evening of glory but his father forces him saying how much Otoku helped him
Ultimately Kiku s father accepts that Kiku may marry Otoku and Kiku tells her this but this reconciliation comes only when she is already on her deathbed in her old family home
Proud that he is at last happy she ushers him to join the river parade and says they will never meet again
She dies at home with her sister and uncle as her husband s parade passes the window

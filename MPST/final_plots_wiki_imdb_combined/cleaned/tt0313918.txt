Generals takes place in the near future with players given a choice of three factions to play
In Generals the United States and the People s Republic of China are the world s two superpowers and are the targets of the Global Liberation Army an omnipresent borderless terrorist organization fighting as a fanatical irregular force
The United States and China are depicted as allies in the series who occasionally co operate against the GLA whose goal is the elimination of the military forces of China and the United States
China The Chinese campaign kicks off with GLA forces launching attacks on Chinese cities starting with the detonation of a stolen Chinese nuclear warhead in Beijing during a military parade which kills thousands
In a separate attack the GLA destroys a bridge leading into Hong Kong to decimate a Chinese armoured division
Undeterred the Chinese manage to hold off the offensive despite having to destroy the Three Gorges Dam in the process in order to stall the GLA s advance and regain the initiative
Now on the counter offensive the United States provides air support to the Chinese as they launch a counterattack into GLA occupied Balykchy almost completely destroying the city
The Chinese then learn that the cell responsible for the attacks across China has been located in Dushanbe and a massive Chinese attack is ordered using nuclear weapons to finally put an end to the GLA incursion
GLA Despite losses against the Chinese the GLA s influence in the Middle East as well as its strong presence in Kazakhstan is relatively unaffected
To continue the war against America and China the GLA acquires cash by raiding United Nations convoys as well as causing mass riots in Astana
Resurrected in the Middle East the GLA now once again poses a significant threat
The United States fully mobilises against the terrorists by raiding the GLA s toxin deposits in the Aral Sea as well as deploying the might of the US Air Force against the GLA s troops
The GLA retaliates by attacking the Baikonur Cosmodrome where it intends to use the Cosmodrome to fire long range toxin missiles at highly populated cities in Europe and abroad
U S The United States military deploys to Iraq Yemen and eventually Kazakhstan to liberate the countries from GLA control
The GLA reacts by firing Scud missiles against American forces and ambushes an entire U S division in the Hindu Kush
Despite its losses the U S continues the offensive and even moves to neutralise a rogue Chinese General who has armed the GLA with nuclear weapons
The U S is able to defeat the renegade and prevent the nuclear weapons from being used
The American resolution to destroy the GLA culminates with Operation Last Call a joint American Chinese assault on the GLA capital of Akmola Kazakhstan
Pulling no punches the capital is liberated from GLA control and the world celebrates the end of GLA tyranny

On her journey she meets Rehan Qadri a Casanova tour guide who flirts with her
Although her friends warn Zooni about him she cannot resist falling in love
On her last night in Delhi Rehan and Zooni spend the night together and end up in bed
As Zooni is leaving the next day on a train Rehan comes in and takes her away with him
Her parents arrive in Delhi to marry them
Zooni has a procedure done that helps her see again but when she comes out of surgery she finds out that Rehan was killed in a bomb blast in the city and is heartbroken
She is taken to the hospital mortuary and told to identify his body
As Zooni cannot see anybody there she is quickly made aware of the sweater that Rehan was wearing which she knitted for him covered in blood and soot
Meanwhile Malini Tyagi is a special intelligence agent brought in to assess the threat of the bomb blast and the group responsible an independent organization fighting for an independent Kashmir known as IKF
She believes it is the work of one man who is helping IKF
It is revealed that the man is Rehan who placed the bomb blast in motion then faked his death so Zooni wouldn t come looking for him
He privately admits that he loves Zooni but also concedes that he can never see her again because of his dangerous life
Seven years later Rehan is on an Indian army camp on another mission for the IKF
IKF has acquired a nuclear weapon but needs to get hold of the trigger which is in the army s possession
Rehan manages to steal it but Tyagi has figured out his plan and sends forces to stop him
In the ensuing shootout Rehan is injured severely
He makes his way to a remote house looking for help
The door opens and it turns out to be Zooni s house
It s also revealed that Zooni had given birth to Rehan s son after Rehan s supposed death
Zooni and her father manage to save Rehan though neither knows his real identity
Though initially distant from them Rehan develops an affection for his son and becomes friendly towards Zooni and her father
Rehan eventually reveals his true identity to them
Initially hurt Zooni refuses to let Rehan leave her again and the two of them are married by her father
Tyagi has a report published about Rehan warning the public that he is a dangerous terrorist
Zooni s father sees this report and realizes that it s Rehan
He holds him at gunpoint but Rehan thwarts him and manages to get the trigger back
In the process though he accidentally throws Zooni s father off a ledge killing him
He radios the IKF from an army officer s house describing his position
However the officer discovers Rehan who then kills the officer
Zooni finds her father s body later and when she tries to tell Rehan he covers
However Zooni later sees the news report and finds the trigger
She takes her son and the trigger and goes to the officer s house
When she finds blood there she radios for help and gets in touch with Tyagi who tells her to stop Rehan at any cost
Rehan arrives at the house the next day and tries to convince Zooni to hand over the trigger
He takes it from her saying the IKF will kill her and their son if he doesn t
Zooni though follows him outside and shoots him in the leg
Rehan draws his gun on Zooni but can t bring himself to shoot her
Zooni shoots him again to stop him
Tyagi arrives and stops the IKF from shooting Zooni
Rehan dies in Zooni s arms
Zooni and her son later visit the graves of both her father and Rehan who are buried next to each other
When the son asks if his father was wrong Zooni tells him that his father did what he thought was right
Both tell Rehan that they love him before leaving

Andrew and his older brother Carl enjoy listening to ghost stories that the local undertaker Mr Bennett tells them
One night Bennett tells the tale of a local farmer whose wife gave birth to conjoined twins one being good natured while the other was clearly evil
The farmer ashamed of them kept the twins locked in their room
Eventually the twins got sick from a liver disease and died together so the farmer sawed them in half and buried the good twin in a cemetery and the bad twin in a shallow grave near the house at the end of an old dirt road called Cry Baby Lane as whoever is caught out there at night will hear the cries of the deceased twin
Later Andrew Carl and a group of friends decide to hold a s√©ance in the cemetery where the good twin is buried but soon after the seance a creepy phenomenon occurs around the town
When Andrew consults Mr Bennett about it he confesses that when the twins were separated the farmer mixed up the twins and tossed the good one in the field and that the good twin is crying for help not vengeance and the bad twin possesses nearly everyone in town and it is up to Andrew to stop him
However during the time Andrew and Carl journey into Cry Baby Lane the evil twin intervenes and possesses Carl who then tries to attack his brother
The evil twin speaking for Carl tells Andrew he can t stop his doing as the cries of the good twin become louder and more desperate
Andrew eventually escapes the car and journeys into the good twin s grave where he must cut a root that was wrapped the good twin s skeleton in order to regain peace
The evil twin showers dirt onto the grave attempting to bury Andrew alive but Andrew manages to cut the root and save the good twin
The evil twin disappears in a flash of light and everybody returns to normal
The next day Andrew wakes up outside of the grave where he finds the good twin s grave with flowers alluding that the twin is now at peace
Andrew then picks a flower from the grave and gives it to Kathy as they leave Cry Baby Lane

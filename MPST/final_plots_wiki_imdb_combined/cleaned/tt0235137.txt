The show centered on the adventures of Shore Patrol Force 30 led by the pasty out of shape clueless lifeguard Notch Johnson
The rest of his patrol consists of B J
Cummings Jamaica St Croix Chip Rommel and Kimberlee Clark
Many of the plots revolved around silly action genre clich√©s and movie parodies with many of the feature roles played by actors and celebrities such as Jason Alexander Mark Hamill Alan Thicke Erik Estrada Gary Coleman John Salley Joey Buttafuoco Patty Hearst Adam Carolla Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf George Takei Gilbert Gottfried Walter Koenig Pat Morita Anson Williams Christopher Darden Maureen McCormick Lee Majors David Arquette Neil Patrick Harris Musetta Vander Angelica Bridges Ian Ziering RuPaul and Dweezil Zappa
The title is a pun on the phrase son of a bitch
Likewise character names are rife with puns and innuendo
Porcelain Bidet B J
Cummings Jamaica St Croix Anita Massengil and Notch Johnson all refer to some sort of double entendre while Chip Rommel s name refers to the Desert Fox further punctuating the fact that the character is German his parents being The Rommels of Paraguay
Notch and B J
are also parodies of the names of the Baywatch characters played by David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson Mitch and C J Kimberlee Clark s name is a pun on the company Kimberly Clark manufacturer of paper products such as Kleenex and Kotex

A short time after the events of the first film Littlefoot and his friends are living happily in their new home in the Great Valley under their families watchful eyes
One day the gang attempts to get to the sheltering grass to play but land in the sinking sand surrounding it
The grownups come and save them and afterwards chastise them for crossing the sinking sand without help
The following night Cera calls the others over for a secret meeting informing them that they need to prove they are adults and suggests running away for a while into the Mysterious Beyond a location just outside the Valley
Before they leave they notice two egg nappers Ozzy and Strut stealing an egg from Ducky s nest and chase them into the Mysterious Beyond
During an ensuing landslide the five are sent to the Mysterious Beyond while the egg rolls safely back to the nest
In the Mysterious Beyond the five discover another larger egg and mistake it for the original
The gang transports the egg into the Valley and despite finding the original egg back in Ducky s nest they decide to hatch it
The egg eventually hatches revealing a baby Sharptooth
While the others flee Littlefoot quickly realizes that he is not yet dangerous and tries to raise the hatchling on leaves though this fails the hatchling whom Littlefoot names Chomper becomes content with a diet of insects
He then hears the others calling for help as the vengeful Ozzy and Strut are attacking them
He runs to their aid but Chomper s shadow ultimately frightens Ozzy and Strut away
Littlefoot exchanges introductions between Chomper and the others
They accept him as part of the group until he bites Cera by instinct
Chomper is told that this is considered bad behavior in the Great Valley and runs off as a result
When the others follow him they find him chasing insects on top of the Smoking Mountain
At the Smoking Mountain Ozzy and Strut attack the children again but Chomper once more comes to the rescue biting Strut s tail
At that moment the volcano erupts lava slowly oozing in the children s path
Littlefoot pushes a tree over a canyon to make a bridge for the others though Ozzy and Strut fall into the canyon while attempting to cross it themselves
Once across the group encounters two adult Sharpteeth on the other side
They escape them and make it back to their families though Chomper runs away again
After fighting the Sharpteeth off the adults inquire as to how they entered the Valley and the children explain their adventure the night before and the landslide that resulted
Realizing the landslide created an opening used by the Sharpteeth to gain access to the Valley the adults set off a plan to close the entrance for good and tell the children to stay behind
Littlefoot runs off into the forest to find Chomper
After finding him they are chased by the two Sharpteeth again
They are cornered by the Sharpteeth when Littlefoot gets his foot trapped in a rotting log
Chomper roars at them and they recognize him as their son and leave with him
Littlefoot frees himself from the log but winds up getting captured by Ozzy and Strut who survived the fall into the canyon
Chomper hears Littlefoot screaming as Ozzy and Strut attempt to drop him off a cliff and goes to intervene but is unsuccessful
Then Chomper s parents rescue him and Littlefoot chasing Ozzy and Strut into the Mysterious Beyond
After they say their final goodbyes Chomper follows his parents while Littlefoot returns to the Valley later assisting the adults in sealing up the entrance between the Valley and the Mysterious Beyond
Finally it is closed forever that way the sharpteeth are never going to go back in again
Afterwards Littlefoot tells his grandparents that being young is not so bad after all but decides he still looks forward to growing up

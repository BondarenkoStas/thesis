After being forced to destroy his own wife Van Helsing turned to the Knights Templar and made a deal with God
Until he kills the last vampire prince Van Helsing will walk the earth as an immortal
The only stipulation is that should he ever drink vampire blood he will be turned and forever damned The first thing Sebastien does now that he s found purpose again is to drink the blood of a prostitute banging his chest after the first few swigs and roaring like King Kong
The next thing he does is change into black leather pants and a new goth shirt and hold a pep rally inspiring the vampires to come out from the derelict stinking moldering buildings in which they are hiding and rise again as hunters of human blood
As luck would have it the prostitute shows up at University Hospital practically drained of blood
She is given eight units of blood but she s not getting any better
When nurse Emily Brent Falco tells Van Helsing about the patient he runs to her room to take a look
Right away Van Helsing knows that she is changing into a vampire
When no one is looking Van Helsing sprinkles her with holy water smothers her with a pillow drives a stake through her chest and cuts out her heart with a cast saw Van Helsing concludes that the vampires are hunting humans again and that it is time for him to come out of hiding and put together a team of slayers
So Van Helsing consults Father Cefalu Anthony Turk who agrees to find some young able bodied seminary students for him to train
The next morning Van Helsing meets seven recruits and gives them a pep talk on the art of vampire slaying
As Van Helsing educates the recruits in the way of the vampire nurse Emily shows up
She explains that she works with the homeless at the parish and that Father Cefalu asked her to come
Suddenly a call comes in
The detective brother of one of the recruits calls to tell him about a body that was just found
It was drained of blood and its heart was cut out
Van Helsing Dominic James Ashby and another recruit head over to the crime scene and begin their first vampire hunt
They look through a nearby abandoned building and sure enough there s a coffin with a vampire in it
Van Helsing tops the coffin with a branch of wild rose and begins firing bullets into the coffin
On his 11th shot the group is suddenly set upon by a second vampire and the fun begins Meanwhile Roman has learned that nurse Emily is Van Helsing s girlfriend so he and Arianna wait in the hall for Emily to show up
When Emily appears Arianna has Roman bite her in the neck then she falls into Emily s arms begging for help
Emily takes Arianna not to the emergency room but to the church where the slayers are training also not noticing that they re being followed by a slug of vampires
Suddenly the vampires crash the church and start beating up the slayers
When Van Helsing shows up holding a cross all the vampires disappear taking Emily with them
Unfortunately for Roman he gets left behind Roman is a bit retarded
Van Helsing forces Roman to reveal that the vampires have taken Emily to an abandoned warehouse where Sebastien is toying with her waiting for Van Helsing to show up
When Sebastien leaves Emily in the care of another vampire Emily loosens the bonds around her wrists and suddenly springs forward crucifix in hand
The vampire backs away and Emily then drinks a bottle of blessed Evian
Meanwhile Sebastien is rallying his vampires again
We are vampires
Yeah
We are hunters
Yeah
While the vampires cheer for themselves Van Helsing and his slayers are sneaking up on them
Suddenly they burst into the warehouse and it s every vampire and slayer for himself
Van Helsing goes looking for Sebastian and Emily Now comes the big showdown
Sebastien has changed into a bolero jacket with red tails and cumberband
He and Van Helsing circle each other making small talk about the past
Off comes the Bolero jacket revealing a white gauzy long sleeved shirt open to his waist
Van Helsing charges with stakes in hand but even after all those years of living on cold rat blood Sebastien is definitely the better fighter
Van Helsing winds up on the ground with Sebastien s foot on his stomach
Suddenly Arianna takes this time to confront Sebastien with his womanizing and let him know how much it hurts her
After reminding Arianna who is the master Sebastien slakes his thirst on Emily
He s feeling pretty good about himself until he suddenly gets a tummyache and realizes that Emily s blood contains holy Evian
Sebastien pounces on Van Helsing anyway but Van Helsing is able to run a stake through Sebastien s heart
He then garrots Sebastian s head off his shoulders
Arianna gets stabbed in the stomach but manages to get away Now that Van Helsing has killed the last vampire prince he prepares to die just as the deal was laid out
When it doesn t happen he is puzzled
Does it mean that God has rewarded him with the ability to live out the rest of his life or does it mean that there is another vampire prince out there

Graham Young has been obsessed with death and the macabre since childhood
He is highly intelligent with an aptitude for chemistry he dreams of poisoning as many people as he can
In his teen years he actually poisons a schoolmate which made him ill rather than killing him in order to date a girl his schoolmate was seeing
His conversation with his date involved vivid graphic descriptions of deadly car accidents
He also reads a comic book account of an event in which the Dutch Resistance killed a whole German army camp in the occupied Netherlands during the Second World War by poisoning their water supply with thallium
Graham is arrested at the age of 14 outside his home in Neasden after having poisoning his father and stepmother with thallium killing his stepmother and making his father seriously ill During the struggle with police he drops his Exit Dose of thallium which he intended to use to commit suicide should he be caught
He is hospitalised for nine years in an institution for the criminally insane during which time a psychiatrist works with him in the hopes of rehabilitating him
Graham s dishonesty becomes evident to the doctor who can see that Graham is trying to deceive him
Graham apparently has no dreams to share with the psychiatrist so he borrows a fellow prisoner s dreams
This source is shut off to him however once the fellow prisoner commits suicide
Despite the initial evidence of deceptiveness on Graham s part the doctor eventually gets him released
Graham then goes to work in a camera factory and is shown the secret ingredient used in the company s shutter system thallium
It is not long before Graham starts poisoning people again
He kills two of his workmates by poisoning their tea with thallium stolen from the laboratory and makes many others ill For months the source of the bug afflicting the workers at the factory remains a mystery until one unforeseen event leads to Graham s being found out
As a hygiene measure all the personalised teacups are replaced with uniform ones leaving Graham unable to poison people selectively
His efforts to memorise which cup is going to which person give him away and his workmates finally realise what is going on
Graham is arrested soon afterwards and he is later sentenced to a lengthy custodial term this time in an ordinary prison
He commits suicide by poisoning himself with the Newton s Diamond he made in the psychiatric hospital
Differences between the film and the real case The Young Poisoner s Handbook is not a strictly factual account of Graham Young s crimes
The film depicts Young committing suicide immediately after his arrest the real Graham Young died of a heart attack in 1990 at the age of 43
The film insinuates that his ambition in life was to create an untraceable poison based on thallium using his knowledge of chemistry in reality his ambition was to become an infamous poisoner an ambition he achieved

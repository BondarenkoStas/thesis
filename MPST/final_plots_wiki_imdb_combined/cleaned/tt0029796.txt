The cartoon starts with an owl named Owl Kott giving an introduction to the festivities
This is followed by a Ben Bernie caricature called Ben Birdie feuding with Walter Finchell
The same spoof was used in the cartoon The Coo Coo Nut Grove
Walter Winchell had a well publicized feud with Bernie at the time which like Jack Benny s feud with Fred Allen was faked for publicity purposes Bernie and Winchell were actually good friends
Next is Milton Squirrel introducing Wendell Howl and an audience trying to figure out which page to go to in their songbooks which results in Wendell getting pelted by the audience s songbooks
Then Billy Goat and Ernie Bear and everyone else sings a song with the lyrics The Woods are full of cuckoos Cuckoos cuckoos The Woods are full of cuckoos and my heart is full of love
During the song a fox called Mr Allen is told that he s singing Swanee River instead of the actual song
Then the song is sung by Eddie Gander Sophie Turkey W C Fieldmouse Dick Fowl Fats Swallow Deanna Terrapin Irvin S Frog Fred McFurry Bing Crowsby Al Goatson Ruby Squealer and Lanny Hoss
Then Grace Moose and Lily Swans sing notes each note higher than the other
Comedian and jazz singer Martha Raye makes an appearance in a scatting jazz take
More caricatures appear including movie critic and gossip columnist Louella Possums Raven McQuandry Joe Penguin Tizzie Fish Jack Bunny Mary Livingstone and Andy Devine
Finally Owl Kott finishes the cartoon by bidding the audience goodnight and saying All is well all is well

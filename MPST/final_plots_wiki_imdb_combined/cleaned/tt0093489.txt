In 2003 burnt out ex CIA Paramilitary operations officer and former U S Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance officer John Creasy visits his old comrade Paul Rayburn who runs a security firm in Mexico
Because of the extremely high rate of kidnappings in Mexico City for ransoms wealthy businessman Samuel Ramos hires Creasy through Rayburn to guard his nine year old daughter Pita
Samuel however is having money problems and intends to keep Creasy on only long enough to satisfy the requirements to renew his kidnap and ransom insurance on Pita
Creasy suffers from alcoholism depression and severe guilt as a result of his former black ops work
Drinking heavily Creasy attempts suicide with his pistol but the bullet fails to fire when he pulls the trigger
He calls Rayburn who says that a bullet always tells the truth
At first Creasy distances himself from Pita but soon he becomes a surrogate father to the girl allowing him to stop drinking and find a purpose in his life
One day while Creasy is escorting Pita from her piano lesson a group of gunmen try to kidnap her
Creasy kills four of the kidnappers including two corrupt policemen in a shoot out but he is shot multiple times and collapses from his wounds and the abductors escape with Pita who Creasy had commanded to flee but returned to the collapsed Creasy
Creasy is hospitalized but is moved to a veterinary hospital by Miguel Manzano a senior agent of the Agencia Federal de Investigación who suspects Creasy will be killed by rogue police
Meanwhile the Ramoses agree to deliver a dead drop ransom of US 10 million per the instructions of La Voz the mastermind behind the kidnapping ring
Samuel s attorney Jordan Kalfus arranges for the ransom money to be collected from Samuel s kidnapping insurance policy then delivered to the kidnappers
The drop however is ambushed by members of La Hermandad a powerful crime syndicate composed of corrupt police officers who steal the money and kill The Voice s nephew in the process
The Voice notifies the Ramoses that Pita will be killed in retribution
Creasy leaves the hospital before fully recovering swearing to Pita s mother Lisa that he will kill everyone involved in her daughter s abduction
Rayburn helps Creasy purchase black market firearms a rocket propelled grenade launcher and explosives
Mariana Guerrero a journalist investigating kidnappings and Manzano also offer their support
Creasy tracks down low level operatives involved in various stages of the kidnapping torturing each for information about other operatives then killing them in brutal ways eventually learning from the president of La Hermandad that the bags they stole at the ransom drop contained only 2 5 million of actual currency while the rest was blank paper
Creasy finds Kalfus murdered and then finds evidence of his questionable financial dealings with Samuel
He confronts Samuel and Lisa for the truth behind the kidnapping
Samuel confesses to Creasy and Lisa that he agreed to Kalfus plan to stage Pita s kidnapping so he could pay off business debts by fraudulently collecting the insurance money
He planned to keep 5 million for himself and split the rest between Kalfus and the kidnappers
He was told that Pita would watch cartoons for a couple days and be returned after the ransom was paid
Samuel confesses to killing Kalfus and Creasy leaves Samuel with a pistol and the misfired round which works for Samuel when he commits suicide
Using the information provided by Creasy The Voice s identity is revealed by Manzano to be Daniel Sánchez who Mariana exposes on the front page of her newspaper
Creasy sneaks into the home of Sánchez s ex wife and children and is shot by his brother Aurelio whom Creasy then captures
Creasy calls Daniel Sánchez and threatens to kill all of his family unless he gives himself up but Sánchez reveals that Pita is still alive and offers her in exchange for Aurelio and Creasy
Creasy and Pita share a tearful goodbye before he surrenders himself to Sánchez men as Pita is released into her mother s arms
Creasy succumbs peacefully from his gunshot injuries
Daniel Sánchez is later killed by Manzano during an AFI arrest raid

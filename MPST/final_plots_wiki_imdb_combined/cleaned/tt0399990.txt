Maburaho is set in a world where every character has the ability to use magic however everyone s magic is not equal
Each person in the story has a different degree of magic and a set number of times that they can use their magic
The average person is able to use magic fewer than a hundred times however some people are able to use magic several thousand times
Because of this a person s social standing is determined by the number of times that he or she can perform magic
If someone uses up all of their magic his or her body turns to ash and is scattered into the winds
The series first introduces us to Kazuki Shikimori a second year student from an elite magic school Aoi Academy
However unlike his classmates Kazuki can only use his magic eight times before he turns to dust
As a result he is at the bottom of the school s social pecking order
However things change one day when Yuna Miyama shows up in his dorm room and declares that she is his wife
Moments later Kuriko Kazetsubaki and Rin Kamishiro appear at Kazuki s dorm the former in order to obtain his genes and the latter to kill him to escape her obligation to marry him
Kazuki learns that he is a descendant of most of the world s greatest magicians from both the eastern and western worlds
Even though he has a feeble spell count his offspring has the potential of becoming a powerful magician
Despite his weak spell count each spell he performs is treated as an epic event
Kazuki s magic is referred to as the most powerful magic in the world able to achieve miracles
Due to Kazuki s kindness his spell count begins to drop as he uses his magic on behalf of each girl
First by making it snow in the middle of summer to cheer up Yuna
Second by pulling Yuna out of a vortex that also merges the boy s and girl s dorms together
Kazuki uses his magic again to destroy two Behemoths in order to save Kuriko who was unable to defeat them
And then Kazuki reverses time to save Rin s homemade box lunch
He also uses it to save his childhood friend Chihaya Yamase after a monster summoned by Kazuki s classmates appeared at the school festival
Not long after Yuna accidentally releases an incurable retrovirus on herself which also creates a doppelganger of her with the opposite of all her qualities
Kazuki uses his sixth spell to obliterate the clone
Finally Kazuki uses his last two charges in order to save Yuna s life from the virus
Each event leaves an impression on the girls and they attempt to keep Kazuki from using any more of his magic and eventually search for ways to increase his spell count
However their attempts fail when halfway through the series Kazuki uses the last of his magic to save Yuna from the magical retrovirus
However while Kazuki turned to ash and the ashes scattered his ghost remains
At this point in the story Shino Akai appears in order to capture Kazuki and add him to her ghost collection
The girls try to protect Kazuki from Shino and eventually learn that Kazuki s ashes had been scattered into each of their own hearts
But before Kazuki s ashes were completely returned to him Shino informs Rin and later the rest of the girls that this is not the first time someone s ashes have been scattered and later restored
However when Kazuki s ashes are returned to him and his body restored he will lose all of his memories
Knowing this the girls still return Kazuki s ashes to him
At the very end of the anime series it is shown that instead of losing his memories as a side effect of restoring his body Kazuki has now split into ten different bodies
In the novel the side effect of Kazuki s restoration was gaining a special magical body that can cause disaster to the whole world if he lets out his magic powers
Another side effect of Kazuki s restoration is the overflowing of his magical powers every now and then causing minor mishaps and sometimes great chaos

Imagine becoming the top writer for Playboy in your twenties
Imagine being a mainstay for the ground breaking Twilight Zone series
Imagine verging on the cusp of a major film writing career
Then imagine a mysterious illness stealing your mind and youth Writer
Adventurer
Provocateur All of these words apply to one man Charles Beaumont
As one of the principal writers for the original Twilight Zone series Beaumont became a mainstay of 1960s television
Later working with filmmaker Roger Corman he embarked on a promising career in movies
By this time Beaumont was also a primary contributor to Playboy Esquire and several other major magazines of the day
Beaumont overcame humble roots bouncing between Chicago and Washington state to become the nucleus of a group of Southern California writers whose ranks include Richard Matheson William F Nolan George Clayton Johnson Harlan Ellison and Ray Bradbury among others
At the height of his career Beaumont began exhibiting strange and frightening symptoms slurring words balance problems memory lapses
Was it alcohol abuse
Was it leftover from his childhood bout of meningitis
Perhaps it was stress Whatever the cause he would not live to see his 39th birthday

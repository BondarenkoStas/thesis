Therefore all of his loving is devoted to his family and to his childhood friends Ferchu and Paco
Shortly after he goes back to his parents house Diego meets Julia Malaguer Podestá with whom he falls in love
Julia however is engaged to Mauricio Doval a successful businessman who hides his bloody business affairs behind his zealous defence of organic and natural products
Diego and Julia have a brief encounter yet due to various circumstances they part company expecting to never meet again
Diego becomes a very close friend of Martina Mansur a woman who lost her small son two years earlier and believes that somehow or other Mauricio is to blame for the death
Martina finds no comfort to assuage her pain and makes up her mind to kill Mauricio
Diego finds out about her plans and in order to prevent her from committing a crime ends up saving Mauricio s life
Mauricio then wants Diego to work for him almost as if he were a lucky charm and he does not stop until he accomplishes his objective
When Diego accepts and visits his new employer he discovers that Julia is Mauricio s wife
Initially Diego is unaware of Mauricio s true background however little by little he learns of Mauricio s deadly business
Although by then knowing this will become too much of a burden for him
And when he feels like leaving the place he will realize this is not possible
At least it will not be possible for him to leave alive
Besides Diego will not dare to leave Julia by herself in the midst of the danger she still is unable to see
Julia does not know who Mauricio truly is and she arranged for her father the well known scientist Alfredo Malaguer to work with him
Mauricio needs his scientific knowledge in order to carry out ambitious and dirty plans and had been after Malaguer even before meeting Julia
Diego will find himself facing a dilemma whether to compromise with the truth and take advantage of it or else to fight as if from within hell itself in order to change it

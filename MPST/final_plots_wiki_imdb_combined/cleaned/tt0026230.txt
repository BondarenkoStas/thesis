Professor Paul Kristan Ralph Morgan doesn t know that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat just before he was born
The doctor who delivered the baby some 40 years ago in a bat infested cave within earshot of angry native drums in the darkest reaches of Africa handed the bundle of joy to his colleague Doctor Anders Bizet Pedro de Cordoba who raised the boy as his own son
Paul is now a grown man beloved by everyone in the village because of his goodness and engaged to be married to the flower of the village the beautiful Marguerite Mane Maxine Doyle Then the murders start
Three victims have been found lying in the caves their throats torn open and the blood drained from their bodies
The cry goes up that this the work of a huge and loathsome vampire bat that kills during the dark of night and then carries the bodies into the caves
Only young David Russell Gleason cannot accept that there is a bat large enough to carry a human body
The good Professor isn t certain that it s a bat but he is sure of one thing the creature strikes only in the dark
Therefore he suggests that everyone stay home after dusk and keep their lights burning After bringing some roses to the good Professor Marguerite meets David in the garden
David has been her friend since childhood and he s in love with her
However Marguerite is intent on marrying Professor Kristan because well he s so good
David attempts to convince Marquerite that what she feels is respect admiration and reverence but not love
Marquerite won t hear of it
She is honored that Professor Kristan has chosen her and she intends to make the good Professor a good wife That night after seeing his last patient Paul retires to his study to read his books by candlelight
The night gets darker Paul falls asleep and the candle burns out
When he awakens it is dark outside
Suddenly his face twists in pain
The good Professor has become the vampire
He climbs through the window of a sleeping girl and attacks her
Somewhat later his faithful servant the hunchbacked Zan Mischa Auer carries Katrina s body into the caves
When the villagers learn that Katrina has disappeared they run to the good Professor for guidance
He advises them to go quickly to the caves but it is too late
Katrina is dead Meanwhile back at the good Professor s house his housekeeper Mother Molly Lucy Beaumont has received a surprise visitor Paul s foster father Dr Bizet
Bizet is surprised at all the candles that Mother Molly has lit
She explains about the killer vampire bat who only attacks during the dark
Bizet looks concerned
At that moment Paul and Zan return home
Mother Molly leaves the room to prepare a room for Bizet and Paul takes the moment to tell Bizet about a problem he has been lately having with headaches followed by vagueness and exhaustion
Again Bizet looks concerned but says nothing That afternoon Paul introduces Bizet to Marguerite
Marguerite takes Bizet on a tour of her garden and Bizet uses their time alone to question her about her feelings for Paul
Later Bizet relays to Paul his belief that although Marguerite loves him nay worships him she is not IN LOVE with him
Bizet suggests that Paul talk to her to confirm his suspicions
A bit later Paul decides to walk over to Marguerite s house and talk with her
He takes a lantern to protect him from the vampire bat
Along the way however he trips and the light goes out
Now in the dark Paul transforms into the vampire
When Bizet finds that Paul is headed to Marguerite s house he goes after him Along the way to Marguerite s house Bizet runs into Paul being carried by Zan
Zan admits that he was afraid for his master and followed him
Paul remembers only that his lamp went out
The three of them continue on to the Mane house and find that the vampire has murdered Marguerite s maid
One of the servants exclaims that he saw a figure a man running from the house
Then David was right Paul sighs
The monster is a man
After a town meeting in which the good Professor again warns everyone to go home and keep their lights burning he also warns John Mane Carl Stockdale Marguerite s father to keep watch over his daughter and never allow her to be alone with anyone
With anyone at all Bizet stresses Who could be committing these heinous crimes
Suspicion falls on Zan and the villagers unite to look for him
Paul is concerned because each time someone was murdered he had fallen into a swoon and couldn t remember his whereabouts
Considering this strange malady that seems to have befallen him Paul decides that it would be best to call off his marriage to Marguerite so he takes a lantern and heads back to her house
Zan begins to follow but Bizet holds him back and wrests the truth it is the good Professor who is the monster and it is Zan who has been carrying and disposing the bodies in the caves Meanwhile David has been visiting Marguerite again trying to convince her that she loves him not the good Professor
Confused in her feelings Marguerite asks David to leave just as her father returns home
When Paul arrives a few minutes later John admits him to the house and leaves him alone with Marguerite so that they can talk
Paul begins to explain to her about his strange malady
When he covers his eyes with his hand Marguerite assumes it is because of the light so she blows out the candle
Paul panics for a moment but nothing happens so he explains that he cannot marry her until he is cured
When he covers his eyes again with his hand Marguerite turns off the lamp leaving only one candle burning
Again nothing happens Paul decides to come totally clean with Marguerite
He confesses that he may be the fiend who is killing the villagers
Marguerite refuses to buy it
In order to prove that he s not the monster she blows out the one remaining candle
Suddenly a cloud passes in front of the moon plunging them into total darkness
A light
Paul screams but the transformation has begun
He lunges at Marguerite who screams
David who is still hanging around outside breaks into the house followed by Zan Bizet and the villagers
Zan runs and the villagers take off after him Paul lies in a swoon on the floor and Marguerite has fainted
When she comes to she tells how the monster went for her throat after which Zan came through the window proving that it couldn t have been Zan
Unfortunately she can t remember the fiend
David chases after Zan to save him while Bizet waits for Paul to come out of his swoon
When he does Bizet finally tells him the truth about his mother and the vampire bat whose bite has condemned him to live with the mark of the vampire
In time he explains Paul will eventually become fully a vampire
When Bizet tells Paul how Zan has led away the villagers in order to buy some time for his master Paul realizes that Zan is in danger and he and Bizet go after him Zan has gone to the caves
Just as the villagers corner him and are trying to decide whether to hang him burn him or seal him in the caves to rot David catches up and informs the villagers that Zan is not the fiend
Paul and Bizet arrive a few minutes later and Paul confesses that it is he who is the fiend
After making David promise to love and cherish Marguerite the good Professor jumps off a cliff
Zan follows suit
The villagers gasp and take off their hats
David holds Marguerite in his arms

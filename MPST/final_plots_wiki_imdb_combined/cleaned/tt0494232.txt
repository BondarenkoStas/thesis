The following occurs directly after the events in Halo Uprising
Background The Covenant currently occupies Earth and is amassed at an excavation of an artifact of Forerunner origin It is a night sky several bright pinpoints of white lights hang in the center
It s a tranquil forest with lust forestry and a winding river
A fireball hurtles through the sky
Then Cortana s voice begins whispering Cortana They let me pick
Did I ever tell you that
Choose whichever Spartan I wanted
You know me
I did my research
Watched as you became the soldier we needed you to be
Like the others you were strong and swift and brave
A natural leader
But you had something they didn t
Something no one saw but me
Can you guess
Luck
Was I wrong
Sergeant Major Johnson and his squad find the Master Chief lying on the jungle ground after having fallen through the atmosphere
It seems that the Chiefs armor is in partial lockdown with its owner unconscious
Just as the Sergeant radios for extraction Master Chief surprises the squad by regaining consciousness
Johnson rebukes the Chief saying You crazy fool why do you always jump
One day you re going to land on something as stubborn as you are
After a quick systems check the Marines and their new found ally the Arbiter head out towards the river for evac
They reach the river and the Pelicans but before they are able to board the drop ships are attacked by Banshees
Johnson and his squad disappear in the ensuing chaos and are presumably captured
It is now up to the Chief and the Arbiter to rescue him
They eventually come across an UNSC outpost which has been taken over by the Covenant
Both the Chief and the Arbiter push though waves of enemy to take back the outpost and rescue the captured Marines
Their victory is short lived however only moments after the fight Covenant reinforcements arrive and the outpost falls under attack once again
Just as it seems like they are about to be overrun Pelicans arrive and spray the Covenant ranks with missiles The Pelicans bring the Chief Arbiter Johnson and his squad to a concealed base deep in the jungle
Master Chief meets up with Commander Miranda Keyes in the Ops Center and they begin to discuss tactics with Admiral Hood
With only a few ships left the Admiral has little choice but to throw everything he has at the remaining Covenant hovering over the artifact
However to do so the Chief has to clear all anti aircraft batteries from the city of Voi
Halfway through the discussion the transmission is interrupted by the Prophet of Truth who claims that Earth will burn until its surface is but glass and that not even the demon will survive
Realizing that an attack is imminent Keyes orders an evacuation telling all able bodied Marines to prepare to fight
The Covenant begin to invade the bunkers so the Master Chief and the Arbiter set off to repel the enemy while Johnson and his squad set up a bomb to destroy the base and the invaders
Halfway through the battle Johnson is driven out of the Ops Center by Brutes
The Chief is forced to return to the Ops Center and rearm the bomb and then make a speedy getaway via the elevator in the hangar Following the plan of attack outlined by Lord Hood the Master Chief must clear a path into the city of Voi
Using spare Warthogs from the barracks the Chief Arbiter and some Marines fight their way through the Tsavo Highway
After several moments of high speed travel and copious amounts of fighting the team comes across a destroyed section of the highway and must continue on foot
This is hardly a favorable circumstance for the Marines as they are massively outnumbered by the Covenant
The Chief is forced to fight through waves of Brutes on foot while waiting for re supplies
Eventually a Pelican circles ahead and drops some supplies as well as a Warthog
They finally reach the end of the highway and encounter a gigantic Brute barricade complete with energy barriers turrets and several Wraiths
Taking out the Brutes one by one the Chief and the Arbiter finally are able to destroy the barrier blocking the tunnel and drive through Having reached the outskirts of Voi the team comes across the first anti aircraft battery
It just so happens that the entire area is swarming with Ghosts and Wraiths giving the Chief and the Arbiter no choice but to jump into battle
The field turns into general pandemonium as explosions blow craters into the ground and vehicles explode into blue flames
Eventually all anti aircraft batteries are neutralized but a scout report tells the Chief that something big is on its way
A Scarab suddenly looms overhead firing beams of plasma at the Marines
Master Chief boards the Scarab and with a few well placed rockets to the power core destroys the walking tank
With the Scarab out of the way the Chief and the Arbiter receive orders to take out the anti aircraft cannon in the vicinity
They head in that direction rescuing several workers and killing a pair of hunters
They reach the heavily guarded cannon and take out all the opposition
Again a few well placed shots into the core of the cannon destroy it rendering the skies clear for an aerial assault on the Covenant war ships
MAC cannons boom as Human gun ships open fire on the Covenant while the Chief and the Arbiter watch
But the attack is cut short by the abrupt activation of the artifact
Blown back by the shock wave the Chief and the Arbiter rise to their feet to witness the Covenant ships entering into a gigantic stable slipspace portal
As the Human ships are recovering from the shock wave another smaller slipspace portal opens and a Flood controlled Covenant ship crash lands nearby Arbiter What is it
More Brutes Chief Worse The Flood immediately begins to spread though the city and hoards of combat forms attack all that move
The Elites begin to deploy drop pods to help manage the outbreak and tip off the Master Chief that Cortana may be somewhere in the ship
The Chief wades through the sea of zombies and manages to get inside
He locates a memory module only to meet 343 Guilty Spark who insists on transporting the module for safekeeping and repairs
Recalling the events on the first Halo where Guilty spark tried to kill him he reluctantly lets Spark carry it
The Master Chief escapes the ship and the Elites proceed to glass the continent in order to contain the Flood
They regroup in the Elite carrier Shadow of Intent high above Voi where Guilty Spark manages to repair the module and deliver Cortanas disturbing message Cortana High Charity the Prophets holy city is on its way to Earth with an army of Flood
I can t tell you everything
It s not safe
The Gravemind it knows I m in the system
But it doesn t know about the Portal where it leads
On the other side there s a solution a way to stop the Flood without firing the remaining Halo rings
Hurry Chief
The Ark there isn t much time Master Chief insists on following Cortanas advice against a reluctant Admiral Hood
Both fleets prepare themselves and follow the Covenant through the portal The fleet exits slipspace at the Ark which is surrounded by the Covenant fleet
The Elite fleet engages the Covenant while Pelicans filled with ODSTs the Chief and the Arbiter stream towards the Ark
Upon landing on the surface Guilty Spark announces that the Prophet of Truth has barricaded himself in the core of the facility and has activated a barrier around it
Destroying the generators will drop a portion of the shield and allow the Marines and the Elites to punch through
Johnson heads towards the third generator the Elites go to the second and the Chief and the Arbiter fly to the first
Master Chief is gazing out of the back of the Pelican when all of a sudden the rear Pelican bursts into flames
The entire fleet goes down destroying lots of supplies and the only Warthog
The Marines are forced to destroy the anti aircraft batteries before re supplying rushing to the tower and disabling the generator
The Elites turn off the second generator immediately after
Everyone turns to observe the final tower but it does not turn off Johnson Brute reinforcements ma am
We re pinned down
Miranda Keyes I m on my way
Johnson Negative
Fire s too heavy
Everyone fall back
Now
Miranda Keyes Sergeant Major
Johnson
Can you hear me
The Marines mobilize on the beach for an assault on the third tower
Master Chief climbs into a Hornet attack craft and escorts the Pelicans and Phantoms to the generator
After taking out several anti air batteries and enemy Phantoms the troops drop off on the towers platform
Fighting through the entire building they finally reach the top and shut off the generator
As Shadow of Intent begins its bombardment of the core the now Flood city of High Charity shoots out of a slipspace portal showering the area with debris
Shadow of Intent is shredded by this shrapnel which render its weapons systems useless
Moreover the Flood is now outside of the galactic target area the Halos wont stop them anymore
Dispatching the local Flood threat the Chief regroups with the rest
A quick journey by Hornet interrupted only by two Scarabs brings Master Chief the Arbiter the Elites and the Marines into the core of the Ark As the Chief and the Arbiter rush as quickly as they can to the top Sergeant Johnson is being beaten by his Brute captives
Seeing as how the Prophet of Truth is about to use Johnson to activate the rings and Master Chief isn t anywhere near the top Miranda Keyes crashes a Pelican through the upper window
She is quickly outnumbered however and reaches a mutual understanding with Johnson
She needs to kill them both so none of them can be used to activate the rings
Just as she is about to shoot Johnson she makes eye contact with him and hesitates then falls to the ground dead her back riddled with spikes
The Prophet drops his spiker with disdain Truth Your forefathers wisely set aside their compassion Steeled themselves for what needed to be done
I see now why they left you behind
You were weak and Gods must be strong
Truth grabs Johnsons hand and forces it on the activation button
Instantly the Control Terminal begins to change and seven holographic halo rings light up one by one
At the end of the corridor the Chief and Arbiter emerge from the lift just in time to witness the activation
As they are about to rush in two pure Flood tank forms drop from above Flood Do not shoot but listen
Let me lead you safely to our foe
Only you can halt what he has set in motion
The unlikely union of Flood Human and Elite rush down the corridor to Truth
With flood forms swarming over every inch of the terminal and the combined efforts of the Chief and the Arbiter all Brute opposition is quickly put down and the Prophet cornered
Truth continues to spew his religious speech even when threatened at sword point declaring at the end that he is the voice of the Covenant
The Arbiter retorts that because Truth is the voice he must be silenced and plunges his sword through Truth
As the Prophet crumples to the ground a sinister laugh echoes through the facility and the Flood forms turn to face the Chief and the Arbiter
We trade one villain for another the Arbiter observes
Johnson rushes to the Pelican with Keyes s body and starts to fly the ship out
Master Chief and the Arbiter try to grab hold but are knocked off Flood forms
They fight their way back to the lift and upon finding it broken jump down the dark shaft The room is dark with exposed wiring lighting up the area in intervals with a shower of sparks
They are scanning the room for hostiles when a purple flicker catches Master Chiefs eye
He jumps up and chases it around the corner
The purple flicker forms into an image of Cortana which keeps on walking
Chief follows the image of Cortana until it stops at a panel
He presses the button and an observation panel opens up to reveal a giant incomplete Halo rising out of the fog Arbiter A replacement
For the ring you destroyedMaster Chief When did you know
343 Guilty Spark Just now
But I had my hopes
What will you do
Master Chief Light it
343 Guilty Spark Then we are agreed
A tactical pulse will completely eradicate the local infestation
I will personally oversee the final preparations
Though it will take time to fabricate an activation index
Arbiter How will you light it
The Chief turns and looks at High Charity deep in thought Two banshees land gingerly on the floor of the Flood hive the former Covenant holy city of High Charity
The Chief and the Arbiter dismount
The entire city is built out of organic material that squishes under boot gaping pulsing oozing orifices and corridors reminiscent of the inside of an intestine
Master Chief and the Arbiter do little more than shoot Flood forms while rushing to find Cortana
Along they way they are assaulted with transmissions from a tortured Cortana and an aggravated Gravemind Gravemind Child of my enemy why have you come
I offer no forgiveness For a father s sins are passed to his son
Of course you came for her
But we exist together now
Two corpses in one grave
Cortana A collection of lies that s all I am
Stolen thoughts and memories
Cortana It was the coin s fault
I wanted to make you strong keep you safe
I m sorry I can t
Cortana What s your name
It s very nice to meet you
You like games
So do I
Cortana I m just my Mother s shadow don t look at me don t listen
I m not what I used to be Gravemind Time has taught me PATIENCE
But basking in new freedom I will know ALL THAT I POSSESS
Cortana I have walked the edge of the abyss
I have seen the future
And I have learned
There will be no more sadness
No more anger
No more envy
Gravemind SUBMIT
END HER TORMENT AND MY OWN
You will show me what she hides
Or I shall feast upon your BONES
The Chief begins to reach the end of the hallway Cortana This is UNSC AI Serial Number CTN0452 9
I am a monument to all your sins
The Chief rushes to the end of the hallway to find Cortana in a Stasis Shield in on of the panels in the room
He beats and bashes the shield until it finally breaks
On a holographic projector lies Cortana
Master Chief tells Cortana that when he makes a promise he keeps it referring to Halo 2 where he promised to return for her
She slowly gets up recovering her strength and presenting the Chief with the activation index from Installation 04
Asking him how he was going to get out the Chief responds saying Thought I d try shooting my way out mix things up a little
He then inserts Cortana into his armor
As they head out Cortana remarks with tenderness Just keep your head down there s two of us in here now remember
Cortana advises that they destroy High Charity
With practiced ease Master Chief takes out the reactors and sends them into critical meltdown
Running and gunning they make it to a downed Pelican and board
With Flood tentacles clawing at the ship and explosions rocking it back and forth they craft struggles for every bit of altitude
They just barely escape a massive explosion and head towards the new Halo ring
These lines refer to the prequel The Fall of Reach
The coin and the game is a test that Dr Halsey performed with John 117 as a small boy
She would flip the coin and John would demonstrate his incredible ability of always winning he is able to discern what side of the coin would land on top when it was flipping too fast to have possibly been seen
Cortana is an imprint of Dr Halsey a collection of her brainwaves and personality
This is the line of dialogue spoken by Cortana in Halo Combat Evolved when you loose your first health bar in combat
She speaks it with rebuke in Halo 1 and with nostalgic love in Halo 3 The Pelican crash lands into a snowy bank revealing an area that looks remarkably like the control room from Combat Evolved
Sergeant Johnson is bringing the frigate Forward unto Dawn closer to the control room for their escape strategy
Gravemind has more than half a mind to stop them however and sends waves of dispersal pods at them
With Flood forms rushing up at them from every direction the Chief and the Arbiter haul as fast as they can to the control room with Johnson providing cover with a spartan laser
They reach the top and Guilty Spark opens the door for them shutting them just in time to block the Flood
Guilty Spark excitedly explains that the ring would be ready to fire in a few days
Its incompletion renders its destruction imminent should it be fired now but of course thats what the Chief needs
Upon hearing this Guilty Spark goes crazy and attacks Johnson Master Chief and the Arbiter
Spark reveals a bit of Forerunner history at this point saying You are the child of my makers
Inheritor of all they left behind
You are Forerunner
But this ring is mine
The armor of Master Chief and the Arbiter disperse most of Guilty Sparks energy but it cuts straight through Johnson s ballistic armor
Master Chief opens fire on Guilty Spark and watches as his bullets ping off Spark uselessly
Suddenly a laser beam lances through the air and Spark is blasted across the room
A mortally wounded Johnson hands an overheated Spartan laser to Master Chief telling him to kick Sparks ass
Several shots from the Spartan laser later and Spark explodes in a shower of sparks
Master Chief tries to revive Johnson but it is clear that he is dieing
Johnson tells chief to keep Cortana with him always and to never let her go send me out with a bang
Cortana activates the ring and everyone runs back outside
Getting into the Warthog that Johnson used to get here they speed away with Halo crumbling around them
The Warthog just barely makes a jump into the hangar of the frigate Forward unto Dawn as the Installation crumbles around them
The Chief inserts Cortana into the ship as Scorpions Warthogs and supply boxes are sucked out by the explosion
The frigate begins to lift off into the portal when a Warthog clips the Chief and he starts to fly out
He punches a handhold for himself into the floor and slowly is able to crawl back into the hangar and take refuge behind a pillar Cortana If we don t make it Master Chief We ll make it
Cortana It s been an honor serving with you John
The Installation fires and subsequently explodes and everything goes blank
This is a remake of the last level in Combat Evolved The front end of the Dawn crash lands into an ocean on earth
Rescue workers recover the half ship and pull the Arbiter from the wreckage
There is no sign of the Chief
After several days a memorial service is held for those fallen in the war Admiral Hood For us the storm has passed
The war is over
But let us never forget those who journeyed into the howling dark and did not return
For their decision required courage beyond measure sacrifice and unshakable conviction that their fight our fight was elsewhere
As we start to rebuild this hillside will remain barren a memorial to heroes fallen
They ennobled all of us and they shall not be forgotten
Admiral Hood I remember how this war started
What your kind did to mine
I can t forgive you
But you have my thanks for standing by him to the end
The Arbiter shakes Admiral Hood s hand Admiral Hood Hard to believe he s dead
Arbiter Were it so easy
The Arbiter leaves the Memorial
His Phantom heads back to the Shadow of Intent hovering above
The Arbiter meets Shipmaster Rtas Vadum on the bridge looking at a holographic image of Earth Shipmaster Rtas Vadum Things look different
Without the Prophets lies clouding my vision
I would like to see our own world
To know that it is safe
Arbiter Fear not
For we have made it so
The Arbiter clenches a fist to his chest Shipmaster Rtas Vadum By your word Arbiter
Arbiter Take us home
The Shadow of Intent leaves Planet Earth
Going back to the memorial underneath the print UNSCDF March 3 2553 the numbers 117 are scratched in to dedicate to the Master Chief who had no picture or belongings to be remembered by
The back half of the Dawn is floating deeper into unexplored space Cortana Chief
Can you hear me
I thought I lost you too
Master Chief What happened
Cortana I m not sure
When Halo fired it shook itself to pieces
Did a number on the Ark
The Portal couldn t sustain itself
We made it through just as it collapsed
Well some of us made it
But you did it
Truth and the Covenant
The Flood
It s finished
Master Chief It s finished
Cortana I ll drop a beacon
But it ll be a while before anyone finds us
Years even Ill miss you
Master Chief Wake me
When you need me
Cortana smiles
The Cryotube seals freezing the Chief Legendary Segment The back half of the Forward Unto Dawn is seen drifting to the night side of an unknown planet
The sun suddenly shines onto the planet chasing away the dark and revealing the Marathon symbol on the planet side

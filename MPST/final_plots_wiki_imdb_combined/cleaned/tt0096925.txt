The film opens with a news broadcast on the apparent sighting of a mysterious creature on the UCLA campus
Among those interviewed are underachieving student Alex Kominski and his girlfriend Cathy Adams
Although neither claim to believe in the creature s existence a hunchbacked figure is shown looking down from the bell tower spying on Cathy through a telescope
While attending a renaissance themed carnival on campus Alex gets involved in a scuffle after insulting another student s girlfriend
When Cathy interjects herself into the fight the creature suddenly comes to her defense
He motions affectionately toward Cathy but is chased away by campus security and eventually captured
After a cursory examination the creature is brought to trial where psychiatrist Dr Victoria Fisk is quick to label him as a menace to society
Cathy refutes the doctor s opinion stating that the creature was only trying to protect her
Another witness Dr Richard Webster the head of the university s Psychology department suggests it might be possible to rehabilitate the creature
Finally the hunchback himself is called to the stand where Dr Fisk asks him who he believes is better qualified to determine his fate Dr Webster or herself
Demonstrating that the primitive creature can only repeat the last thing he hears spoken he predictably answers Dr Fisk
She then further humiliates him by prompting him to describe himself as a complete and total fool
Given the evidence Judge Ferguson orders that the hunchback be confined in a mental facility
When Cathy protests the creature stands and acknowledges both her and the judge by name leading the judge to overturn his ruling and award temporary custody to the university under the supervision of Dr Webster with the condition that should the creature exhibit any violent behavior he will be institutionalized
Upon being escorted back to the university the creature shows Alex Cathy and Dr Webster his home in the bell tower cluttered with various objects scavenged from around campus
Reluctant to leave him alone in the tower Cathy encourages Alex to stay and watch over him with Dr Webster offering to get him special consideration for the task from his instructors at the university
Left with little choice in the matter Alex agrees
Over the next several days the hunchback undergoes a series of observational tests including speech therapy with Dr Diane Girard
Despite his unusual behavior he learns quickly and with time he and Alex eventually become friends
During a session with Dr Webster the creature is asked to choose his own name
After settling on Bob Maloogaloogaloogaloogalooga he explains that after his father deserted them and his mother died from illness a group of people came and locked him away
He then managed to escape custody and take up residency in the bell tower
Despite all his progress Bob remains infatuated with Cathy
While Alex struggles to catch up on his studies in order to pass his finals Bob strives to better himself in order to win Cathy s affections
But when he suddenly presents her with an engagement ring Cathy has no choice but to turn him down
Heartbroken Bob returns to the bell tower where he receives a phone call from Dr Fisk
Desperate to prove her theory that Bob is a danger to others she falsely tells him that Cathy was injured in an accident
Bob immediately races across campus to the girls dormitories but is confused to find Cathy alive and well
With campus security closing in on him Bob flees into the streets of Los Angeles
Alex and Cathy and the rest of Bob s supporters then appear on a controversial talk show hosted by Stanley Hoyle who attempts to demonize Bob in every way possible
When Hoyle states that Alex and the others are in big trouble for supporting the hunchback Bob who has been watching the program on television is prompted to come to his friends aid
After taking a taxi to the studio he makes his way in through the roof and swings down from the catwalk to snatch up Dr Fisk
Forced to confess her lie in front of everyone the live audience quickly turns to Bob s side chanting his name
Stanley Hoyle then apologizes to Bob for his slanderous remarks and Dr Webster suggests looking into a scholarship for Bob at the university
When asked by Hoyle if he would have done anything different up to this point Bob takes Dr Girard into his arms and kisses her at two speeds a reference to an intimate experience Bob once had with a Hoover vacuum cleaner
Bob then smiles sheepishly into the camera as the film ends

Pierre Bellemare a French radio personality appears to recount four strange seemingly non coexisting tales that make up the complex narrative structure of Three Lives and Only One Death
In the first tale we are introduced to Andre Parisi a family man who has woken up with a terrible headache
Andre leaves to a local cafe where he meets one of the multiple enigmatic central characters Matteo Strano
Matteo offers Andre champagne and 1000 francs to listen to his story
Prior to the scene of Matteo s own storytelling he reveals he was once married to Andre s wife
Matteo recounts the day he went out on a whim and rented out an apartment
Matteo insists this apartment is inhabited by fairies who eat time and who ultimately devoured 20 years of his life in one night
Matteo uses the story of his strange journey in time to entice Andre into going to his fairy house Andre accepts Matteo s request and is surprised to find that the apartment actually exists
Matteo takes Andre s fondness for the apartment as an acceptance of a deal that allows Matteo to go home leaving Andre to remain in the bewitched apartment
When Andre refuses to take Matteo s place he finds himself with a hammer in his head thus retrospectively explaining his headache as a premonition After a 20 year hiatus Matteo returns to his former home and his former wife Maria as if nothing had changed
Bellemare then recounts the tale of George Vickers a 69 year old bachelor and Professor of Negative Anthropology at Sorbonne
When Vickers ascends the main stairs at Sorbonne to give the opening lecture at a major conference on Negative Anthropology he pauses and is overcome by a strange force and feeling
The strange force takes him to a graveyard where he shortly experiences grief
When a storm breaks out he becomes profoundly happy so much so that he does not look for shelter
He becomes a beggar overnight and strangely finds success
Vickers is ambushed on a routine walk home to an abandoned courtyard but is saved by a prostitute Tanya La Corse aka Maria Gabri Colosso
Tanya takes Vickers back to her apartment
Vickers explores her apartment and grabs sight of a series of books by Carlos Casta√±eda
Meanwhile it is revealed that Vickers occasionally hears Carlos s voice
Vickers professes a passionate loathing of those works in Tanya s apartment
Vickers and Tanya Maria form a firm friendship Vickers even moves to a new bench to be closer to his new friend
Tanya Maria tests the new friendship by entrusting in Vickers to keep a close eye out for her extremely dangerous ex husband
When Vickers fails to to alert Tanya Maria he returns home to a bench outside his mother s home
When he learns of her death he experiences a strange feeling of nostalgia and returns to his role as a professor
One day the past catches up with him and he learns Tanya Maria also lived a double life as the president of a huge electric company who had been led to prostitution by her husband
Vickers and Tanya Maria rekindle their relationship and marry
Like clockwork Vickers once again ascends the main stairs at Sorbonne when he suddenly pauses walks back down the stairs and leaves for the graveyard
Meanwhile Tanya Maria ex husband returns and re ignites her taste for the perverse Both Tanya Maria and Vickers once again reverse back to their roles as Prostitute and as beggar
Bellemare opens the third tale with an announcement about the foundation of the tale that of which extreme happiness is an extreme form of misery and excessive generosity is an excessive form of tyranny Bellemare also proclaims that the next story is so true it has taken place not once but several times This third tale which revolves around a young Parisian couple Cecile and Martin in love sets the stage for the crossing between the stories and roles played by Mastroianni
The young couple receives a mysterious weekly gift of 2 000 francs in their mailbox and proceed with their perfect happy life
Both Cecile and Martin embark on affairs out of kindness Cecile cheats on Martin with the next door neighbor Piotr a college student who cannot bear to hear the couples all consuming love for each other

However the young couple forgives one another
The stories from earlier begin to collide in a seemingly rapid pace

The butler plays odd games with the couple who are now expecting a child
The butler hides the bell and drugs them into sleeping for days on end
One strange night Martin finds the Butler conversing with a businessman and a tramp The tramp leaves Martin bloodied and dazed
This leads to the couple s immediate departure

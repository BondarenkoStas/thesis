Seven very tired passengers Ernesto Indio González Godo Luis Ciges Cesar David Aller Marcos Manuel de Blas Alma Dianik Zurakowska Raquel Charo Soriano and Raquel s eight year old daughter Violet Sarita Gil are traveling by bus to Bojoni where they have secured jobs working for an aristocratic family
Suddenly the bus driver suffers a heart attack
After moving the dead driver to the back of the bus Ernesto takes the wheel
When a road sign indicates that Bojoni is 110 Km while the town of Tolnia is only 10 Km the group decides to get dinner and lodging for the night in Tolnia before continuing to Bojoni in the morning
When they arrive in Tolnia however there is not a soul to be seen except for Luis Jack Taylor an American traveler who arrived in Tolnia about an hour ago and has been walking around the village looking for someone anyone The fire in the village tavern is warm and the shelves are stocked with liquor so the travelers help themselves and decide to rest in the inn s bedrooms while Ernesto stays in the tavern in case someone shows up
As the hours pass and the clock strikes midnight Ernesto goes out to check on the bus and discovers that the dead driver is missing
As he walks around the village looking for the driver Ernesto is attacked by some ghoulish villagers intent on drinking his blood In the morning the travelers awaken to a breakfast of rolls and hot coffee
All the villagers have returned including Major Boris José Guardiola the village mayor
The Major apologizes and explains that the villagers were at the cemetery yesterday paying their respects to a recently deceased but well loved villager
The Major graciously extends the village s hospitality to the travelers even serving them a delicious roast before they leave for Bojoni
Unfortunately when they go to leave the bus won t start
Danged if Luis s car has the same problem
Looks like they ll have to stay on for a few days until they can get help from Bojoni
Marcos makes it clear that they don t have the money to pay for their food and keep but the Major assures them that they will be taken care of comfortably by the Countess
And so they are
Every day they are served luscious meat dishes
What they don t know is that the Countess Helga Liné has ordered that various villagers give up parts of their body in order to feed the visitors The Countess like everyone else in the village is very eager to have the travelers remain in town for a few days enjoying the village s hospitality at her expense
She is so thrilled at having persons who get around that she invites Cesar the well read professor to remain at her house that evening in order to recite to her from the works of Shakespeare Browning and O Neill
Part of her hospitality includes taking Cesar to her bed but she s not after sex it s Cesar s blood she wants
After drinking her fill the Countess tosses his body over the veranda to the hungry villagers below Meanwhile back at the tavern Luis is busying himself peeping on Alma through a hole he discovered in his wardrobe
Marcos and Godo are summoned by Ernesto to see something in the bus but fall prey to the vampires
The next morning Luis notices that the bus is missing begins to get suspicious and starts planning out a means of escape
Violet is playing hide and seek with a boy Fernando Romero she has befriended when she witnesses the arm of the ax grinder being chopped off but she says nothing
A nice dinner is served that evening but Alma is very upset when she finds a finger on her plate
A bit later Raquel tells Violet to stay in their room while she goes to talk with Marcos but Violet s boy friend persuades her to come out and play anyway
He leads her into the cemetery
When the vampires come out he tries to hide Violet but ends up smothering her
Raquel has returned to her room and found Violet missing so she goes looking for her daughter
Unfortunately for Raquel she encounters the villagers along with Cesar Ernesto Godo and Marcos who fall prey upon her That night Luis and Alma make their escape
Of course they are pursued by the village people but they finally manage to make it to Bojoni

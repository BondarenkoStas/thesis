Mystery writer Philip E Marlow is suffering writer s block and is hospitalised because his psoriatic arthropathy a chronic skin and joint disease is at an acute stage forming lesions and sores over his entire body and partially cripples his hands and feet
Dennis Potter suffered from this disease himself and he wrote with a pen tied to his fist in much the same fashion Marlow does in the last episode
Although severe Marlow s condition was intentionally understated compared to Potter s whose skin would sometimes crack and bleed
As a result of constant pain a fever caused by the condition and his refusal to take medication Marlow falls into a fantasy world involving his Chandleresque novel The Singing Detective an escapist adventure about a detective who sings at a dance hall and takes the jobs the guys who don t sing won t take
Writers will recognize that like Potter Marlow is plot dreaming trying out various solutions to a working plot in his head deciding as he goes what plot element works best with what character or situation interspersed with bits of ideas that occur to him off the wall and discarding parts of his story that no longer work when other changes have been made
The real Marlow also experiences flashbacks to his childhood in rural England and his mother s life in wartime London
The rural location is presumably the Forest of Dean Potter s birthplace and the location for filming but this is never stated explicitly
The suicide of his mother is one of several recurring images in the series Marlow uses it in his murder mystery and sometimes replaces her face with different women in his life real and imaginary
The noir mystery however is never actually solved all that is ultimately revealed is an intentionally vague plot involving smuggled Nazi war criminals being protected by the Allies and Soviet agents attempting to stop them
This perhaps reflects Marlow s view that fiction should be all clues and no solutions
The three worlds of the hospital the noir thriller and wartime England often merge in Marlow s mind resulting in a fourth layer in which character interactions that would otherwise be impossible occur
This is evident in that many of Marlow s friends and enemies are represented by characters in the novel particularly Raymond Marlow s mother s lover appears as the central antagonist in the real and noir worlds
The use of Binney as a villain stems from the fact that Binney committed fornication with Marlow s mum and simultaneously cuckolded Marlow s dad who Marlow loved
Marlow s own guilt at his apparent belief that he caused his parents separation and even his mother s suicide is exacerbated by his early childhood memory when he framed young Mark Binney for defecating on the desk of a disciplinarian elementary teacher
The innocent Binney is brutally beaten in front of the classroom and Marlow is lauded for telling the truth
All of these events haunt Marlow and one of the shadowy villains who apparently is determined to kill Marlow looks very much like an adult version of the real child Mark Binney
The real Mark Binney eventually ends up in a mental institution as Marlow confesses later to the psychiatrist
The villainous Binney Finney character is killed off in both realities
It is suggested that in each reality the guilt of Binney Finney Mark is entirely the product of Marlow s imagination as in one case Finney the wife s lover does not exist in the other it is the name of the character Marlow chooses as the guilty party and the boy s guilt is a lie told by Marlow to his teacher
However in the end Marlow chooses a killer who looks more like adult Binney to live and himself to die thus showing growth

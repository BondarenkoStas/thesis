The film begins and ends on October 16th 1999 with 20 year old Kolia a Russian army recruit recording and narrating with a handheld video camera as young drunken Russian soldiers taunt terrorize and finally execute a civilian Chechen couple in front of their teenage daughter Raissa
Kolia s story is one of four personal narratives that unfold against the backdrop of the ruins of a village in Chechnya the flood of civilian refugees from the village and a family partially reunited
We first meet Kolia as a pot smoking guitar player in Perm 2300 kilometers from the Chechen border where he is taken into custody for possession of drugs and drafted into army service
As a new recruit he undergoes a brutal transformation from an innocent youth into a dehumanized killing machine
When Kolia s fellow soldiers kill the Chechnan couple the couple s nine year old son Hadji hides and watches and when it is safe he is able to carry his infant brother to relative safety
The trauma of his parents death renders him mute

Hadji s elder sister Ra√Øssa searches for both brothers
Helen a Red Cross worker is interviewed by Carol and places hope in the International response to the Second Chechen War to the centuries old struggle of the Chechen people
Raissa reunited with her baby brother escapes once again from the village with the help of other Chechen refugees
She has to leave without Hadji against her will because of the Russian federal forces aerial bombing
Raissa helps Helen at the International Red Cross orphanage
Both Helen and Carole are discouraged when the United Nations Commission of Human Rights report of April 2000 does not declare the situation in Chechnya a humanitarian disaster
Carole delivers her report to the United Nations but soon realizes that not many of the participants are listening
With the help of Carole and Helen Hadji is reunited with his siblings

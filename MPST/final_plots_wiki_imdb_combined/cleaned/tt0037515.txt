Ten people are gathered for a long weekend on an island off the coast of Devon England
They are the guests of the mysterious Mr and Mrs U N Owen whom none of the ten has ever actually met
During dinner they notice the centerpiece of ten china Indian figurines and they compare it to the nursery rhyme counting down from ten to none
After dinner a recording suddenly blares through the room accusing them each of the death of another person or persons
Judge Quincannon is accused of sentencing to death an innocent man named Edward Seton
Dr Armstrong is accused of operating on a woman while drunk and causing her death
Lombard an adventurer is accused of allowing a group of native people to be massacred in Africa
Vera Claythorne is accused of the death of her sister s fiance
Nikki Starloff is accused of running over two people with his car
General Mandrake is accused of sending his wife s lover to be killed in the war
Miss Emily Brent is accused of causing the death of a young man by driving him to suicide
The Rogerses are accused of helping the old lady they took care of to die a little sooner than she should have so that they would inherit her money
The voice promises them justice
After this recording the startled guests compare notes and discover they ve been lured to the island under somewhat false pretenses and they further discover that they are totally cut off from the mainland until the weekend is over
Prince Nikita Starloff suddenly chokes on his drink and dies
Nobody likes to suggest murder but he doesn t seem the type to suddenly commit suicide
The hysterical Mrs Rogers is given a sedative by Dr Armstrong and her husband and the doctor get her to bed
But in the morning she is found dead
The eight remaining people make the connection from the two deaths to the nursery rhyme Ten little Indian boys went out to dine One choked his little self and then there were nine
Nine little Indian boys sat up very late One overslept himself and then there were eight
They search the island for Mr
Owen
They find they are alone and they figure one of their number is a murderer
They begin to compare stories and admit their levels of guilt
The next to die is the General who is found dead of a knife wound down by the seashore
Each time one of the people is murdered they find another statue gone from the centerpiece
They think Rogers is the most likely candidate for the murderer so they make him sleep out in the woodshed
But Rogers is found dead of an ax wound to the head in the morning and Miss Brent is missing she is discovered walking alone down on the seashore
They want to accuse her but while they are running around in some confusion she is killed with a hypodermic
Now the remaining five realize they need to keep together in groups
They tell a little more of the truth of themselves except Vera won t admit any guilt
While Vera Lombard and Blore realize that three is the safest number the judge and the doctor agree they can form an alliance and find out the truth themselves
When the judge dies from a gunshot wound to the head next only the doctor examines him and makes that declaration
Then with all the electricity gone from the house in the darkness the remaining four lose the doctor and while Vera Lombard and Blore get ready to go look Blore is killed by someone pushing a piece of chimney down on him
Lombard and Vera are alone together and they suspect each other
But they also feel a definite attraction to each other and they end up agreeing that they don t really think the other is guilty
Vera pretends to shoot Lombard on the beach and he falls as if dead
Vera goes back up to the house and discovers there s a hangman s noose waiting for her to use it
The judge is sitting in a chair alive and explains his plot to her
He thinks he knows that each person is guilty and that the law cannot touch them so his plan has been to execute them all and then commit suicide
He tells Vera that if the police arrive and find nine dead bodies they will hang her for murder so she may as well hang herself
He drinks a glass of poison but Vera and Lombard who is actually not Lombard but an innocent friend of Lombard s are left alive and in each other s arms

With the whole world going crazy about the vampire trend it s high time we expand the universe of our very own mythology
The aswang one of the most popular monstrous creatures immortalized by many Filipino literature pieces TV shows and movies returns this November with Regal Film s Aswang
Directed by Jerrold Tarog the same director behind what s probably the most outstanding Shake Rattle and Roll episode in recent years tries on his same mix of clever storytelling eerie atmosphere and spine chilling sound in this full length horror suspense film
Beyond the more popular aswang imagery of the mysterious barrio people living off innards of the unsuspecting and the flesh of unborn babies Tarog s Aswang introduces a new breed of human eating monsters called the abuwak
In this movie the abuwak race is being threatened by extinction
The only way they can grow in numbers again is through the rare ability that only the soon to be queen of the abuwaks Hasmin possesses
Abuwaks look human when they re in their normal state but they can fly and move underground when they transform
They are quick and strong and they can attack and eat humans whether in complete darkness or broad daylight
Hasmin doesn t like all of these preferring to congregate with humans and even protecting them when her fellow creatures attack the village
There are things that we all are forced to do even though it s not what we want to do she says about her flesh eating nature in one of her somber scenes and this is where her parallelism with Daniel begins
Daniel is an assassin or hitman by profession but he was only forced by circumstances from he was very young
Like Hasmin he doesn t really like killing the innocent and this reluctance is what leads him to the abuwak lair suggested to be somewhere in Pampanga
When Daniel sees Hasmin for the first time he instantly falls in love leading to a series of pursuing stalking rescuing and some hairclip giving for an entire day that ends with the greatest declaration of love for both torn characters
But this love angle between Hasmin and Daniel is only one of the layers of stories in Aswang
The movie effectively meshes together several storylines that are all presented in the movie s one day time frame
There s the story on why Gabriel and Ahnia set foot in abuwak territory there s the reason why Hasmin devoted all her life helping a blind woman living by herself there s the gang of assassins who in the end had a very symbolic clash with the abuwak race and of course there s the king of abuwaks Moises who apparently has great ties with the local government unit influencing DPWH projects and has a serious case of pre wedding jitters
All these layers make the storytelling in Aswang very crucial and here we see why some great horror films need more time to develop the script
The movie carefully and skillfully unravels each subplot without suffering due to abrupt edits and leaving everything to say an elderly wise man who will explain everything to through a monologue
Current Regal films favorite Lovi Poe can rightfully claim this movie to be hers as she captures the essence of the beautiful and mysterious reluctant monster
Her innocent yet seductive hip swaying and hair flipping all over the place which almost make her appear like she s floating plus her sweet non threatening voice which can turn strong and filled with conviction when she s with her fellow abuwaks make her character enchanting and even endearing
Paulo Avelino however needs to do better to convince the viewers that his character dealing with internal conflict
He has an opportunity to play a character that is so rich and multi dimensional but the character appears flat and bored all throughout the movie
Albie Casi√±o and Jillian Ward meanwhile are successful in keeping a straight face despite the deaths and devouring happening all around them which is absolutely not right
Other standout performaces are also delivered by Marc Abaya who s becoming one of the go to person for bad guy roles and of course from the veteran reliables Bembol Roco and Nonie Buencamino who leaves a mark even with his minor role
But really the stars are just the bonuses in this movie which is impressive narrative wise and more importantly visually stunning thanks to some breathtaking locations like the river the forest and the convincingly designed abuwak mansion
Also worth noting is the excellence in sound which makes even a shot of insects crawling to a hole appear something to be coming from a nightmare
This movie deserves to be watched not just because of Lovi and Paulo s star status that can make Twitter followers post pictures of themselves with the Kagatin Mo Ako sign
Aswang is another proof of the Filipino movie industry s excellence in the horror genre which should really be the case since we have a rich source of materials in our myths and legends and we have great love affair with the paranormal and everything unexplained
And for a commercial horror movie Aswang should be lauded for being brave enough to tell a story that tackles themes and imageries that expose an adult and mature side
It s been a long time since we saw a local horror flick not written with kids in mind

The party meet Sephiroth at a Cetra temple where he reveals his intent to use the Black Materia to summon Meteor a spell that will fatally injure the Planet with a meteorite strike
At the point of impact Sephiroth will absorb the Lifestream as it attempts to heal the wound becoming a god like being

Aerith sets off alone to stop Sephiroth following him to an abandoned Cetra City
During her attempt to pray for help from the Planet Sephiroth tries to force Cloud to kill her then kills her himself before fleeing leaving the Black Materia for the party to reclaim
The party then learns more of Jenova whose remains were unearthed by Shinra scientists several decades earlier and mistaken for a Cetra
In an experiment at Nibelheim Jenova s cells were used to create Sephiroth
Five years prior to the present Sephiroth and Cloud were sent to Nibelheim on a mission where Sephiroth discovered the truth about his origins
Driven insane by the revelation he murdered the townspeople then vanished when confronted by Cloud
The party heads to the Northern Crater where Sephiroth will use the Black Materia

Tifa stays with him and when the island is attacked by a Weapon the two fall into the Lifestream

The SOLDIER in his memories was his friend Zack Fair
At Nibelheim Cloud was injured but fatally wounded Sephiroth who only survived due to Jenova
Cloud and Zack were then taken for experiments by Hojo with Zack escaping four years later with a catatonic Cloud
The two were eventually cornered by Shinra soldiers and Zack was killed the combined trauma of his experience the experiments and Zack s death triggered an identity crisis with Cloud constructing a false persona around Zack s stories and his own fantasies

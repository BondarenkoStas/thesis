This is a story derivative of The Dirty Dozen but set during the American Civil War
Eli is to be hanged for looting when he and some other men condemned to death are pardoned providing that they follow former US colonel Pembroke in an attempt to recapture Ft Holman which he earlier had surrendered to the Confederate army
The volunteers are a deserter who have killed two sentries a man who has murdered his commanding officer and raped the wife of the victim a horse thief two looters one who has stolen medicine so soldiers have died and an Indian bastard who has killed a white man that sold liqueur to the Apaches
However the one presented as the worst of the bunch a religious pacifist agitator declines the offer and is hanged
Pembroke holds the group together by saying that he really is after a treasure of gold hidden inside the fort
At Ft Holman Eli gains entrance as a Confederate orderly in a stolen uniform
He realises that there is no gold and also learns that the present commander Ward used Pembroke s son to blackmail him into giving up the fort
Then Ward killed the son anyway
When Eli is exposed he produces a paper to show that he is a security officer and criticises the lack of security
Ward plans to save his own hide by executing the security officer but the others are let in by Eli and attack the garrison
After the battle only Pembroke and Eli stand as survivors
Pembroke kills Ward with his own sword and the two survivors leave together

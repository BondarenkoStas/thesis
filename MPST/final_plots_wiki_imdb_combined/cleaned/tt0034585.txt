A bald haired magician named Ala Bahma is nailing self promoting posters on every conceivable surface including a tree in which Bugs is living
Bugs protests having his home encroached and his right to private property compromised until the magician apologizes and offers Bugs a blackberry pie
The rabbit s expression momentarily changes to joy as Ala Bahma magically brandishes a blackberry pie from underneath his cloth then suddenly splatters the pie in Bugs s face
As the magician walks away laughing What a dumb bunny
an enraged Bugs decides that it is time for revenge and says his famous line Of course you realize this means war
Bugs exacts his revenge through a series of public humiliations at the Bijou theater where Ala Bahma is performing
First Bugs replaces himself with a carrot during Ala Bahma s hat trick and gets into his outfit
Despite Ala Bahma s objections Bugs claims he will to help the magician
He goes into his hat and repeats Ala Bahma s hat trick and accepts brief applause
Bugs gets into Ala Bahma s hat kisses the magician and ties up his mustache
When Ala Bahma unties his mustache he sees a sign posted by Bugs to tempt him with a carrot
Next Bugs grabs Ala Bahma s mallet and hits him as he grabs the carrot and eats it
Ala Bahma puts his hand in the hat only for Bugs to pull the magician in
As Bugs emerges however Ala Bahma grabs him and after they fight off screen the magician barricades his own hat with wood planks and nails to make sure that Bugs does not get out
Later Ala Bahma does an Indian Basket Trick performance with Bugs posing as a volunteer
During his trick he puts the knives in the basket
When Ala Bahma discovers that Bugs has snuck out from behind him while feigning pain Bugs runs and attempts to jump into his hat but hits it on the barricade
Ala Bahma charges at Bugs to kill him but Bugs plays a statues game on the magician
Once Ala Bahma gets close enough Bugs dresses up as a fencer for Ala Bahma to fight him
Bugs escapes to the balcony to heckle Ala Bahma
Realizing that he has been tricked again Ala Bahma uses a shotgun and fires at Bugs
However Bugs appears from Ala Bahma s hat and places a cigar in his mouth which promptly explodes
After kissing Ala Bahma Bugs brandishes his own blackberry pie
He says to the audience quoting Red Skelton s Mean Widdle Kid If I dood it I get a whippin I DOOD IT
and splatters the pie in Ala Bahma s face
Bugs ends his performance with Aloha Oe on a ukulele as he descends into the hat

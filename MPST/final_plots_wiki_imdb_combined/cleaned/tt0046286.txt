The Doctor and Jo visit the Master now held in captivity on a small island prison after being captured by UNIT
The Master is being held indefinitely and is the only prisoner
He is watched by CCTV and the island is patrolled by armed guards trained to resist the Master s hypnotic powers and even protected by minefields
He claims to have reformed but refuses to reveal the location of his TARDIS
As they depart the old school patriotic governor Colonel Trenchard tells them that some ships have been mysteriously disappearing
The Doctor cannot resist investigating and he and Jo are soon attacked while examining a Sea Fort by an underwater Silurian
This man sized bipedal lizard is called a Sea Devil by a crewmember who s been driven half mad
They escape to the nearby naval base HMS Seaspite run by the efficient Captain John Hart despite the Doctor s eccentric behaviour an alliance forms
Hart is in charge of the adaptation of the sea fort for use as a SONAR testing station
The Doctor meanwhile discovers that the Master assisted by a misguided Trenchard is stealing electrical equipment from the naval base to build a machine that will control the Sea Devils
The evil Time Lord intends to use the reptiles as an army to enable him to conquer the planet and he begins by using the machine to summon some of them from the sea
Soon however a battle for the prison ensues during which Trenchard who had believed he was aiding his country against enemy agents is killed
The Doctor and Jo are forced to flee to HMS Seaspite where Hart tells them a naval submarine has disappeared
The crew prepare to battle the sea devils
The Doctor investigates in a submarine bell and is seized by the Sea Devils who take him to their leader
The Doctor enters the Sea Devils base and tries to encourage peaceful negotiation recalling how he had failed to broker an agreement between mankind and the Silurians but matters are left unresolved when the base is attacked by depth charges
This attack has been ordered by a gluttonous and short sighted politician Robert Walker who has arrived at HMS Seaspite to take control of the situation and is intent on repeating UNIT s actions on Wenley Moor blowing up the creatures but this time with nuclear weapons
Hart and Jo are opposed to the attack but at least it allows the Doctor cover to flee even if he has failed in his initial attempt to sue for peace
The Doctor persuades Walker to allow him a final attempt at negotiation but in the meantime the Sea Devils capture the naval base
They have been inspired to such actions by the Master who still wishes to instigate a war
The Master then forces the Doctor to help build a machine to revive Sea Devil colonies all over the world
Returning to the Sea Devil base the Master activates the device whereupon the Sea Devils imprison both Time Lords as they are now both equally useless to them
However The Doctor has sabotaged the machine and he and the Master escape the base using escape equipment from the captured submarine
As they are rescued massive power feedback from the sabotaged machine destroys the Sea Devil colony before the military attack can begin
As he has done before the Master is able to escape capture and flees the scene
Continuity The Master is seen imprisoned in a high security island establishment having been finally caught at the conclusion of the serial The DÃ¦mons at the end of the previous season
He states that he learned of the Sea Devils from the files he stole from the Time Lords in Colony in Space
This story introduces the aquatic cousins of the Silurians the Sea Devils
The Silurians first appear in Doctor Who and the Silurians and appear alongside the Sea Devils in Warriors of the Deep
In this story the term Sea Devil is used only by humans although Silurians and Sea Devils use the term in Warriors of the Deep
The earlier Doctor Who and the Silurians had resulted in many letters from scientists and geologists who argued that it was impossible for a reptilian lifeform to have existed in the Silurian era
In this story the Doctor admits that the name Silurian is inaccurate and states they should more properly be called Eocenes

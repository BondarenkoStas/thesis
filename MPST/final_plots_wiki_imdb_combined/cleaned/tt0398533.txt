Please Twins
is a story about three high school students Maiku Kamishiro Karen Onodera and Miina Miyafuji
The three were drawn together by a photograph of their childhood home which later makes all of them seek out the house in the picture
However the picture shows only two children a boy and a girl
The three conclude from this that only one of the girls either Karen or Miina can be related to Maiku
The other must be a nonrelative
The only other identifying feature of the pair in the picture is that the boy and the girl have eyes of the same unusual color a feature that furthers the ambiguity as all three of them share the same eye color
The main concern of the male lead Maiku is that although he eventually comes to care for both of the girls he does not know which of them is his sister
In addition the two girls develop feelings for Maiku forming a love triangle that cannot be resolved until the truth of their relationship is known
All three main characters are in the predicament of wanting to discover their past versus the risk of losing a romantic relationship
The events of the story are set the year after Please Teacher
and characters from that series appear in supporting roles throughout Please Twins

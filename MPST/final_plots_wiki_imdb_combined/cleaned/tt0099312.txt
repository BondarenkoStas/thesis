In a small Midwestern town Roger Phillips is found dead
When insurance investigator Sam Donovan arrives looking into the apparent suicide all clues lead him to suspect murder
The man was shot but there are no powder burns on the body nor was a pistol found
Unfortunately no one wants to assist him with the case including Sheriff Larry Best despite a double indemnity clause
It turns out the dead man was universally hated
One of the prime suspects is Frank Baker who eloped with Phillips daughter the night of the death when Phillips objected to the marriage
During the investigation Sam and local girl Anita Weatherby are strongly attracted to each other
This causes complications when Anita finds her father s hidden Luger pistol while searching for a place to store her diary away from her inquisitive younger sister
Meanwhile at the annual town Christmas tree lighting the residents are grieved to learn that beloved longtime physician Dr Gerrow has died of a heart attack
Finally Sam plants a false story in the newspaper stating that he has sent for a chemist to find clues of the killer s identity from the floor of the house where Phillips died
The chemist is due very soon so Sam waits for the murderer at the scene of the crime
Sheriff Best shows up first but he knew the story was a fake
Next to arrive is Anita s father Stu Weatherby followed by Anita
Sam accuses Stu of the crime but then realizes from the position of the murderer that he had to have been left handed which rules Stu out
Then Sam remembers from his previous investigation that Dr Gerrow was left handed
Stu confirms Sam s guess
Weatherby came upon Dr Gerrow just after the doctor snapped and killed the man responsible for so much misery to his loved townspeople
He talked Gerrow out of turning himself in and took the Luger away

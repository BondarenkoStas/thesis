Beatrice is a young woman working in a media center under a woman known only as The Boss
She receives a recording from her fiancé Jim who has been sent as part of a small production crew to Iceland to investigate a Monster that lives there
Determined to find her fiancé Beatrice convinces her boss to send her to Iceland but her plane crashes
She is the only survivor and in order to walk again undergoes an extremely painful radical surgery
As she recovers she befriends Dr Anna who helps her travel to the remote village where the monster lives
After cajoling Beatrice into drinking herself into unconsciousness the villagers strip her and leave her as an offering to the Monster himself a foul mouthed alcoholic beast old enough to remember human ancestors crawling from the seas
Beatrice shows him no real fear although the Monster tells her he has killed her friends and might kill her too
He tells her that he wants to die but is indestructible
In an effort to force Beatrice to try to kill him he proves that he killed Jim and his crew
She shoots him twice and he reacts in obvious pain but heals almost instantly
He tells her of a mad scientist Dr Artaud who had discovered a way to kill him but Dr Artaud had been taken away in a straight jacket
Beatrice offers to help him find Dr Artaud if the Monster comes with her to New York and promises not to kill anyone while he is there
In New York the Monster becomes a celebrity with the Boss staging a media frenzy as they search for Dr Artaud
They find that he is working for the government
While Beatrice revels in the attention the Monster remains miserable and drunk
The Boss makes a deal with a government scientist to study the Monster and he s rushed away by army guards who mislead him into believing he is going to see Dr Artaud
Instead he is subjected to torturous experiments as the scientists try to discover the key to his indestructibility one of them noting that he can t seem to tolerate new information
One of those experiments involves the Monster being ridiculed and beaten on the street to study his behavior
The Monster holds true to his promise to Beatrice and does not kill anyone
Meanwhile Beatrice meets Dr Artaud by chance
With Margaret a remorseful former coworker of Beatrice s they hatch a plan to escape back to Iceland with the Monster
They make their escape but are pursued by the government who fears the Monster and Artaud might fall into the wrong hands
Artaud builds a machine that will kill the Monster
Beatrice bids the Monster a tearful farewell and kisses him goodbye
As the machine starts the army storms their hideout
As the lights flicker on and off and the machine moves the Monster into place the Monster and Beatrice face each other one last time
Her face flickers in his vision for several minutes before the screen blackens

In May 1986 cop Ron Hartley is at a crime scene during which two people were murdered
He is traumatized from the experience and begins to question the beliefs of his religion
In Phoenix Arizona David Young tests a bomb he made on an old bus which succeeds
He then expresses his triumph with his wife Doris
In Cokeville Wyoming Ron is playing with his two children Cindy and Jason
When the family s nightly prayer comes Ron refuses to say it as he is questioning his faith due to all the horrible things he s seen
His wife Claudia is worried for him
On a Sunday Ron does not attend his church with his family
Meanwhile David is travelling with Doris buying groceries as materials
He has his two friends Gerald Deppe and Doyle Mendenhall meet him in Cokeville
David and Doris demonstrate igniting gunpowder while it is in the air making it seem as the air is on fire
Deppe and Mendenhall take the plot as launching illegal fireworks
The next day the five set out for Cokeville Elementary School where David reveals their real plan is to take the school hostage and blow it up with his bomb which will then lead to David being the leader of a brave new world
Deppe and Mendenhall refuse to cooperate and David handcuffs them in the back of his van
Ron on the same day travels to help his brother with some issues while Cindy and Jason go to the school
During the past few days at the school the fire alarms have been going off without any smoke or any other trigger baffling the staff
David Doris and Penny bring the bomb into the school with Doris and Penny carrying firearms
Penny is reluctant to follow the plan
The three walk into the school undetected and announce to their secretary their plan
They take her hostage and when David starts harshly yelling at a student Penny confronts him
Instead of shooting her like he had earlier threatened he gets his car keys and throws them at her commanding her to leave saying she is no daughter of his
After Penny leaves David and Doris take three people and take them into Room 4 where David takes control of a class in the room
Doris then manipulates the rest of the school to go into Room 4 telling them a surprise waits for them
After all 136 students and 18 teachers are in the room David takes control by sitting next to the bomb where he if he pulls a trigger it will set it off and with the firearms
After a few minutes the principal who had been away walks in and discovers the situation
David tells him to call the local authorities and tell them he demands 2 000 000 for each child and if he doesn t return in 15 minutes he will shoot the students
Penny travels to the local police station where she informs them of her father s plan proving it by showing them Deppe and Mendenhall still handcuffed
The police take the three for questioning while they start informing the families
Ron begins to return to Cokeville when he is informed of the hostage situation
He is still far out but starts to rush towards Cokeville as he is the nearest officer and every other one is out of town
In the school gas from the bomb begins to leak and children are getting sick
One of the teachers convinces David to let them open the doors and windows
After the principal returns David demands him to call the White House
After a few hours including plans by the teachers to create a boundary between the bomb and the children David is getting more and more agitated especially when Jason starts to taunt him
After Jason crosses the boundary around the bomb David s emotions are let out and he yells at Jason
While David is in the restroom Doris has the trigger for the bomb but accidentally triggers it after jerking her hand
The bomb explodes and Doris suffers severe burns
The children are quickly evacuated as firefighters and paramedics are stationed right outside
David kills Doris to put her out of her misery and shoots a teacher in the back
Everyone safely evacuates and David kills himself
Ron is informed of the bombing and he expresses that God isn t real
He arrives in town rushing towards the school
A few days later Jason and Cindy have both sustained burns but are physically fine
Jason however seems traumatized and Ron takes him to see a psychiatrist
After the appointment the doctor is baffled and tells Ron to have a talk with Jason
Ron and Claudia both talk to Jason who then tells him there were other people in the room
He confides in them that he saw angels
Ron doubts this but Claudia believes him after he points out a picture of his great grandmother who passed away years earlier
Ron questions this and Claudia convinces him to gather evidence
He visits multiple families who inform him of similar experiences
He visits the local bomb expert who tells him that 3 of the 5 wires in the bomb were mysteriously cut
The expert also points out that the windows provided an opening for the explosion
He is baffled that shrapnel David put in the explosive flew around but no one was injured
While Ron speaks with Claudia he tells her he found out every one of the hostages prayed some time during the crisis and that some ran back into the room to help others
Despite all this information Ron is reluctant to believe it
On Sunday Jason refuses to attend church unless Ron does so as well
Motivated to attend for Jason Ron tries to make it through the meetings
But after the main meeting Ron s doubts start to control him again and he tells Claudia that he can t do it
She tells him that he needs to control it or he could lose her
Ron then overhears some words the bishop is saying in a class where he says that hatred will not be the answer
Ron then goes to the youth room where they are singing A Child s Prayer
He notices that almost all of the kids in the room have some injuries of some kind and he becomes humble
Cindy and Jason notice him and run to him and he asks them to forgive him
That night at the family prayer Ron is saying it for the first time

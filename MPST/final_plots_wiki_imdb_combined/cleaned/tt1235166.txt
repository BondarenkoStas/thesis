Malik El Djebena a 19 year old French youth of Algerian descent is sentenced to six years in prison for attacking police officers
Alone and illiterate upon his arrival he falls under the sway of Corsican mobsters led by CÃ©sar Luciani who enforces a brutal rule
The prison is divided between two main factions the Corsicans and the Muslims
Malik keeps to himself
When Luciani forces him to be the unwilling assassin of Reyeb a Muslim witness in a trial Malik gains the protection of the Corsicans in spite of his Arab origin
Malik serves as a low level servant to the Corsicans who treat him with disdain
All the while he is haunted by visions of the murdered Reyeb
When the bulk of the Corsicans are transferred or released Luciani is forced to give Malik more responsibility
Having secretly learned Corsican Malik acts as Luciani s eyes and ears in the prison
When Malik earns the privilege of day long furloughs outside the prison Luciani relies on him to conduct his criminal business outside
Ryad a Muslim friend teaches Malik to read and write and the two become close
Ryad teaches Malik about his own heritage introducing him to two other Muslims Tarik and Hassan and increasing his power within the prison
Malik also becomes involved with a prison drug dealer Jordi
When Ryad gains an early release due to testicular cancer the three partners organize a drug running enterprise to sell hashish
But when Ryad is kidnapped by the drug dealer Latif Malik tracks down Latif s relative inside the prison
He kidnaps the relative s family and forces Latif s gang to release Ryad
When Luciani discovers that Malik is using his day releases for his own personal enterprise he punishes him
Malik is sent to meet Brahim Lattrache in Marseille another Muslim who is involved in a deal between Luciani and the Lingherris an Italian mafia group
Lattrache is bitter toward the Corsicans for the murder of Reyeb and holds Malik at gunpoint
When Malik spots a deer warning sign he remembers a recent dream of deer running in the road
He tells his kidnappers that they are in danger of hitting wild animals and they suddenly strike a deer
Lattrache is impressed by Malik calling him a prophet and agreeing to do criminal business with him instead of Luciani even though Malik admitted that he killed Reyeb
Luciani believes there is a mole in his organization and decides to use Malik to assassinate Jacky Marcaggi the Don of the Corsican mafia for secretly dealing with the Lingherris
But Malik and Ryad have their own plan for Marcaggi they kill his bodyguards and dump him in a van with his Corsican enemy Vettori Luciani s henchman
Malik takes refuge at Ryad s house with his wife and young son
Ryad s cancer has returned his decision against more chemotherapy leaves him just six months to live
He gets Malik to promise to take care of his family when he s gone
Upon Malik s return to the prison he is placed in solitary for returning late putting him out of reach of Luciani s retribution while Marcaggi uses his influence to wipe out much of Luciani s faction
Once back in general population Malik joins the Muslim faction in the yard
When a now powerless Luciani tries to approach him two Muslims intercept and beat him
On the day of his release Malik is met by Ryad s wife and son outside the prison
They walk off together followed by a vehicle convoy carrying Malik s new associates

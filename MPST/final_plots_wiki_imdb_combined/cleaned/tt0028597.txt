When she returns in the company of her handsome music teacher Armand Duvalle Jerry learns that Lucy spent the night in the country with Armand after his car they claim broke down unexpectedly
Lucy then discovers that Jerry did not actually go to Florida though he went so far as to get an artificial tan and write multiple fake letters home to convince her that he did
Mutual suspicions result in divorce
During the divorce proceedings Lucy moves into an apartment with her Aunt Patsy and becomes engaged to a neighbor Oklahoma native Dan Leeson while Jerry is seen on a date with singer Dixie Belle Lee

Wanting to avoid complications Jerry slips into Lucy s bedroom too
A fight erupts when he finds Armand already there
When Jerry chases Armand out of the apartment in front of the Leesons Dan and his mother stalk out
Afterwards Jerry is seen around town with heiress Barbara Vance
To break up this relationship on the night before the final divorce decree Lucy crashes a party at the Vance mansion pretending to be Jerry s sister
She acts like a showgirl and lets on that Jerry s father had been a gardener at Princeton University not a student athlete as Jerry had claimed
Realizing that his chances with Barbara have been effectively sabotaged Jerry drives Lucy away in her car
Motorcycle policemen stop them on the road and Lucy plotting to spend more time with Jerry wrecks the car
The couple get a lift to her aunt s cabin from the policemen

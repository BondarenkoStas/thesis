In August 1944 the Allies have invaded German occupied France
Nazi Captain Erich Neumann speaks over the phone comforting his family as he is concerned for their safety
Afterwards he executes two French men
On the early morning of August 15 paratroopers from the 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team land in Provence France under heavy fire from the Germans
Two soldiers Corporals Harland Bud Curtis and James Rossi land separately and alone
Curtis is pursued by Germans after a flare exposes his location but he manages to escape
Hours later Curtis tries to hide from a passing German patrol but is spotted
Seeing himself outnumbered he quickly surrenders
As he is restrained and searched however a grenade is thrown into the patrol distracting the Germans
Rossi who had snuck up on them kills the entire patrol and rescues Curtis
Rossi determines using a map and a compass that the two are still miles away from their intended landing zone in Les Arcs a French village
The two set off before finding an abandoned shelter where they are followed by Curtis s commander Sergeant Caleb Jones
Jones explains that the trio must head for Les Arcs as soon as they can as the Germans may send patrols after them
The three travel through the French country eventually stopping at a road
They encounter Neumann who is meeting with fellow officers and troops
The three try to hide in the grass but Rossi inadvertently alerts them to his position and is forced to open fire and kill a German
The two groups engage in a brief firefight which ends in all of Neumann s troops being killed
Seeing this he tries to flee and is pursued by Jones
Neumann trips and Jones catches up to him but is reluctant to shoot him being religious
He apparently kills Neumann anyway
The three soldiers continue making their way to Les Arcs when they find a woman named Emilie who is a member of the French Resistance
She explains that her fellow Resistance members are being held prisoner by Germans not too far away and she needs help rescuing them
Rossi is against this suspicious of her motives but Jones agrees to help
The group is briefly attacked by a German plane after it shot down an Allied plane
They find a dead American paratrooper and bury him
The soldiers find where the French are being held so Jones and Rossi separate to clear the building while Curtis and Emilie cover for them
Jones is attacked by Germans but they are soon shot by Curtis and Emilie while Rossi kills guards on the other side
They find three prisoners Philippe Gustave and Jacques but they learn one other was apparently tortured
Rossi goes to rescue the other but discovers he is dead
He is then attacked by two Germans
Rossi shoots and kills one and engages in hand to hand combat with the other
Before Jones and Curtis can intervene Rossi overcomes an intense fight and brutally beats the German to death
Jones is shocked by Rossi s brutality
Jones who speaks French plans with Philippe to travel to Les Arcs where Germans have overtaken the town
Along the way they encounter two American troops Lieutenant Woodard and Private Stewart
Their vehicle has broken down and Curtis begins to fix it
Rossi and Emilie have a shooting contest where Rossi bets a kiss and Emilie bets a whistle
Emilie surprisingly wins but kisses Rossi anyway bewildering him
After Curtis fixes the vehicle Jones notices Woodard has German binoculars and wears brass on his uniform something U S troops don t do in combat
He realizes the two are Germans posing as Americans and captures them
Jones tries to get info from them and Woodard admits they were assigned to kill a high up German officer to prevent his capture after Gustave kills Stewart
Jacques takes Woodard away and returns with two more French soldiers
The group arrives at Les Arcs and Jones spots a Panzer division where a tank and a vehicle full of German troops are about to leave intending to attack the rest of the paratroopers
Jones decides to ambush the Germans and the group splits up into two
Curtis fires a missile at the tank briefly stopping it but the German troops disembark the truck and start firing
The Allied group starts firing back at them resulting in high German casualties
Jones and Curtis both start pursuing the tank which apparently fled earlier but now is firing at the group
All French troops except for Emilie are killed
Rossi covers for Jones and Curtis while they go after the tank
More German soldiers are killed as the skirmish ends with Jones disabling the tank
However he is seriously wounded when a German shoots him in the chest
Curtis tries to flee but is shot in the back
Rossi is also seriously wounded after being shot
As all three lay dying they have recollections of their previous lives
Curtis tries to recite the Airborne Creed something that had been said multiple times throughout the film
Before he can finish he has a hallucination of his girlfriend but in reality is Emilie trying to tend to his wounds but he ends up dying in her arms
Rossi regains consciousness and is approached by Neumann who Jones spared earlier
Rossi gets up to fight but collapses due to his wounds
Neumann does not kill him honoring Jones example
He takes Rossi to an abandoned farm where he bandages his wounds and makes him a meal
Neumann tries to befriend Rossi but Rossi cannot understand why a German is treating him well

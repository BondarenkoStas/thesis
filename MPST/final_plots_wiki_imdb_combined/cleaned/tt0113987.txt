The film covers most aspect of Nixon s life and political career
The film implies that Nixon and his wife abused alcohol and prescription medication
Nixon s health problems including his bout of phlebitis and pneumonia during the Watergate crisis are also shown in the film and his various medicants are sometimes attributed to these health issues
The movie also hints at some kind of responsibility real or imagined that Nixon felt towards the John F Kennedy assassination through references to the Bay of Pigs the implication being that the mechanisms set into place for the invasion by Nixon during his term as Dwight D Eisenhower s vice president spiraled out of control to culminate in the assassination and eventually Watergate

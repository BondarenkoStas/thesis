After completing his studies in London Shakti Thakur returns to his ancestral village in India
Accompanying him is his girlfriend Anita whom he is in love with and wants to marry much to the disapproval of his family
After a few days Shakti starts to feel that nothing much has changed in his hometown and longs to leave
He tells his father that he wants to sell his share of the family s property and open a chain of restaurants
His father the zamindar Raja Thakur urges Shakti to stay in the village and help it progress by virtue of the latter s education saying A man gets an education not to become a selfish being but to uplift his uneducated brothers and society
Shakti disagrees with his father and decides to leave
He is unable to bear the animosity amongst the townspeople particularly between his dad Raja Thakur and rival Zamindar Birju and his son Bali Thakur
The entire village suffers from this longstanding family feud as most of the village and its surrounding areas is divided between the brothers
Since Bali Thakur holds a grudge and always tries to one upon Raja Thakur it puts them at loggerheads with each other
Shakti spends time in the village with his girlfriend by re visiting his childhood memories including a game of sticks with Bali Thakur men which he wins
They come across an old temple which has been closed off on Bali Thakur s instructions
He insists on entering and his friend and servant Sukhiya breaks open the lock for them to look around
Bali Thakur hears of this and a brutal riot is started among the two village factions
Raja Thakur in order to quell the situation contemplates on apologising to his opponents
Shakti feels it should be him or Sukhiya who should apologise
When Shakti asks for Sukhiya he learns that Bali Thakur s men have cut off Sukhiya s hand as punishment for opening the temple and Raja Thakur s men burn down the homes of Bali Thakur villagers in retaliation
To prevent a further escalation of the situation Shakti with permission from his father enlists the help of his friend in the government and opens the temple for all legally
Slighted by this Bali Thakur hires goons to break a dam protecting a part of the village faction that supports Raja Thakur
Although a female villager spots one of the goons near the dam she does not think much of it
The dam is damaged by explosives used by the goons which results in flooding of half the village
This results in numerous deaths including infants which deeply saddens Shakti
He spots the goon who placed the explosives again in the village and gives chase
After capturing he hands the goon over to the police but the goon does not speak of Bali Thakur s involvement due to fear for his own family s safety
Later Bali Thakur intimidates a villager living in Raja Thakur s area to close a portion of his land preventing the public from reaching the main road easily
Shakti and his father invite them for talks at village Panchayat to resolve the standoff due the riots and flooding
In the village panchayat accusations fly from both sides
With no evidence backing up the truth Bali Thakur accuses Raja Thakur for orchestrating various attacks on his brother s family and insults him relentlessly
Disrespected and heart broken Raja Thakur returns to his home and passes away due to a heart attack later that night
Shakti takes over his father s duties as the head of the village
As time passes this incident dies down
The villagers express concern to Shakti about going around the piece of land that has been closed off and causes a much longer travelling time
Shakti reasons with the owner of the land to open it up for all villagers to pass so that their long commute is shortened
Although understanding and willing the land owner is afraid of Bali Thakur s backlash especially since he has a young daughter Gehna
Shakti assuages his fear by arranging marriage between a well to do person from his village to the land owner s daughter
Everybody involved happily agrees and the land owner opens up the land for everyone
On the day of the wedding the groom runs away fearing Bali Thakur
The landowner and his daughter are distraught over this claiming that it is a huge disrespect to his family
He opines that even if someone marries his daughter they have to live in constant fear
Shakti then gets permission from the landowner and weds his daughter
Although Shakti still has feelings for his girlfriend and his new bride is very shy they overcome their awkwardness and move on
Soon his girlfriend returns and learns the truth
Although saddened by the turn of events she understands the situation and leaves
Shakti too closes the chapter about his girlfriend and starts his new life with his wife
Bali Thakur enraged by the opening of the land plants a bomb during the village festival despite the pleas of his mother and own father to stop the violence
This results in deaths on both sides of the village
Both factions of the village wanting revenge go after Bali Thakur and his family
Shakti protects the innocent family and helps them get away from the villagers
Appreciative of Shakti s efforts to protect them Birju Thakur finally ends his enemity towards him
Shakti eventually finds Bali Thakur and asks him to surrender to the police before the villagers kill him
Bali Thakur s rabid hatred for Shakti makes him reject his offer of help
Bali Thakur blaming Shakti for all his problems tries to kill him
In the struggle that follows Shakti accidentally decapitates Bali Thakur
Although other villagers are willing to take the blame for Bali Thakur s murder Shakti gives himself up to the police to end the cycle of violence once and for all
The film depicts the true meaning of education as a tool to uplift uneducated people

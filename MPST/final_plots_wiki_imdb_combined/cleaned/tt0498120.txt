When the play begins Nicola is being guided through an unoccupied flat by Stewart her estate agent keen to make a sale
Stewart is unable to get Nicola s approval chiefly because there is no suitable room to be used as a study for her fianc√© Dan
However when Nicola returns to her current flat she expresses frustration over Dan s insistence that their new flat must have a study
When challenged as to what Dan needs a study for his reasons are rather flimsy such as needing a room to quietly reflect and contemplate things
Nicola is also frustrated by Dan s lack of effort to find a job and lack of housekeeping
Dan goes out drinking at a hotel bar where he is a regular known by the bartender Ambrose with whom Dan shares his philosophy on women and how hard they are to please
It become clear that Dan has very little idea what to do with his life
He returns drunk to Nicola s annoyance
Stewart returns to the office and chats to his co worker Charlotte with whom they share a very fond friendship albeit a totally platonic one
Charlotte openly a devout Christian frequently reading her Bible lends Stewart a video of a programme she recorded Songs That Changed My Life
Stewart agrees to please Charlotte and returns home to the flat he shares with his sister Imogen
After Imogen goes out for the evening Stewart puts the video on
The programme is a religious one consisting exclusively of Christian songs that various obscure Christian figures find uplifting and Stewart is barely interested until the programme ends
Then the video returns to what was partly recorded over a pornographic video and Stewart watches in amazement
Imogen in the meantime spends the whole evening waiting for a date from a dating agency who fails to turn up
When Imogen returns home both she and Stewart lie about what they have been doing that evening
As an evening job Charlotte starts working as a new carer for Ambrose s bed ridden father Arthur
Most of the previous minders have quit and the reason soon becomes obvious Arthur is ungrateful and rude constantly shouting hurtful abuse at his minders belittling their efforts to help him
Charlotte is no exception and when she makes Arthur soup she is rewarded by him throwing it in her face
In spite of this Charlotte tries her best drawing strength from her belief that to give in is giving in to the Devil
At work Ambrose again serves Dan who had an argument with Nicola whilst viewing another flat
It now transpires that Dan used to have a promising career in the Army but was dismissed after the men he was responsible for committed some undisclosed atrocity
Although Dan accepts that what his men did was wrong and as the only officer present he should carry the can he appears to be in denial about his share of the responsibility
Vaguely referring to a past relationship Ambrose suggests that the solution may be for Dan to at least temporarily meet other women
Dan returns home drunk again and this time the row escalates and Dan mentions they break up for a while exactly how Ambrose suggested
Feigning indifference Nicola accepts saying she may also meet someone else
Stewart nervously returns the video to Charlotte paying her compliments and Charlotte lends him another video
After Imogen leaves that evening Stewart watches the video but fast forwards through the faith programme
Like the last video it then goes straight into the middle of a porn movie only this time Stewart finally realises that it is Charlotte in the video
However Imogen returns early and catching him watching the video much to her disgust
The following day Stewart returns the video to Charlotte again dropping compliments he tries to kiss her but Charlotte backs away so Stewart leaves in guilt
Alone in the flat Nicola burns one by one letters that Dan used to write her letters that Imogen mentions elsewhere were beautiful letters from a much younger and inexperienced Dan she once knew
Far from the impression she gave the night they broke up she cries as she burns the letters
Dan meanwhile has checked into the hotel whose bar he frequented so often
Dan confidently tells Ambrose he is making a new start and already has a date lined up from the dating agency
Imogen leaves her flat without even speaking to Stewart
It turns out her date is Dan and amazingly they hit it off instantly
Both use assumed names and Dan quite convincingly glosses over the bits of the past he is ashamed of and yet confides that his father no longer speaks to him and he can only visit his mother when he is not around
They drink until the hotel bar closes and agree to see each other again
Imogen returns home happy and drunk but hurtfully taunts a miserable Stewart for the video caught him watching calling him a greasy pornographer
During her care visits Charlotte talks about her religious beliefs to Ambrose
She believes strongly in all the vengeful parts of the Old Testament but also in the forgiveness that comes later
Ambrose for his part reveals that his father was thrown out by his mother when he was young and he only saw him again after his mother died a possible atonement for his years of estrangement
Arthur s behaviour never improves and he insults Charlotte for being ugly
Finally on the third evening Charlotte promises Arthur something he won t forget and enters his room wearing a skimpy outfit looking mischievous
But as she leaves she looks uneasy about what she has just done
In the morning Dan waits with flowers ready for Imogen in his hotel bar
But before she arrives Nicola finds him having correctly guessed where to find him
They sit at a table and although a reconciliation of sorts is achieved it becomes clear there is no chance of a future together
Unfortunately at this moment Imogen enters and sees Dan sitting at a table flowers resting there talking to another woman
Imogen leaves distraught
Ambrose tells Dan she just left but it is too late for Dan to catch up with her and Dan knows no way of contacting her
Stewart having earlier heard from Nicola that she no longer needs a flat tries to apologise to Charlotte saying he will understand if she wishes to take the matter further
Charlotte responds by saying that as a Christian it is in her nature to forgive and therefore she forgives him
But she adds that there is evil in all of them and Stewart must never do this again
Then to bury the hatchet she gives Stewart another video
Stewart takes the rest of the day off sick and again fast forwards through the faith programme
This time however there is nothing after the programme but static which Stewart sits watching
When Charlotte calls for her minding she finds Ambrose packing a suitcase for his father rushed to hospital
He tells her than Arthur whom she left sleeping soundly had a heart attack later
With some embarrassment Ambrose says that Arthur said strange things about her dancing naked and other stuff he can t repeat
Ambrose talks about a close male friend in an old photograph Charlotte noticed possibly implying Ambrose may be gay
As Charlotte departs she leaves Ambrose a video
In the final scene Nicola packs her suitcases Ambrose returning with his father s unpacked suitcase Dan sits at the bar with his drink Charlotte opens a folder at her desk and Imogen joins Stewart on the sofa and they comfort each other
As Imogen switches off the TV the play ends

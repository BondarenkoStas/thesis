A flashback of six months ago shows the office of the Indian RAW chief Roy where he and his trusted men plan a daring covert operation
The man known as Jude Rosario in the opening sequence is shown to be Captain Daniyal Khan a dead end ex soldier with a completely deadened sense of life and death is pulled out of oblivion and pressed into service by the spy agency to wreak vengeance on the men who planned the 26 11 Mumbai terror attacks
He agrees on the assurance that he will be reinstated in the Indian army to the same rank from which he was court martialled which meant regaining the respect of his estranged father
His only team member Nawaz Mistry helps him find his first target Sajid Mir at a cricket match

Coming back to the present Daniyal aka Jude has landed in the same jail as David Headley
He contacts Nawaz in order to acquire money to buy a battery as a replacement of another one which holds a certain poison
The poison is untraceable as it could kill a person whose tongue even comes in contact with it with a heart attack
After killing David Headley Matthew Broody who supposedly died upon falling in the river is found alive and Daniyal is released as his earlier sentence is rendered null and void
Meanwhile ISI agents gather information about Daniyal Khan
Daniyal and Nawaz through Syria go to Pakistan to take down the last two perpetrators Sahabuddin Umvi and Haaris Saeed
In Pakistan they make plans of killing Saeed with the help of local restaurant owner Khalid by an explosive planted in the mic used during his public speech
However their plan fails leading Daniyal to pursue Saeed in a car and shoot him dead also causing an explosion
Umvi is killed with the help of a nurse Amina Bi who replaces his regular syringe with a poisoned one
With the Pakistani army and ISI pursuing them Daniyal and Nawaz make their way to the coast to escape through the Arabian sea
Their accomplices get caught and interrogated for information or killed
While they are escaping on a boat the Pakistani military finds about it and sends patrol boats to apprehend them
While hiding in the waters Daniyal gets shot by the military and dies
Nawaz later gets rescued by the Indian Navy
Later she goes to the Taj Hotel and has two cups of tea fulfilling a promise earlier made to Daniyal

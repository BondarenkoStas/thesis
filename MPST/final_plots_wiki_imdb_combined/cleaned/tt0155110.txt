It s Christmas Eve and Richie Rich the world s richest kid is all excited to spend the day with his friends
While racing wildly with his friends in the snow Richie s butler Herbert Cadbury controls the cars using a remote and guides the children back to Richie s house
He then reminds him about his responsibilities that are due to be executed on Christmas Eve and instructs him to change his clothes and get ready for tea
Before going to do so he visits his home scientist Professor Keanbean who shows him his recent invention a wishing machine which works only on Christmas Eve
The day being that Richie wishes for a big pie from it and is given a pig sty instead
Cadbury is disgusted seeing this and sends him off to change his clothes
He meets his parents Richard and Regina Rich to ask what they would like to have for Christmas
While with them he also tries out his father s new fishing rod invented by Keanbean which hooks on to a tuna sandwich in the vicinity
He then goes on to change his clothes
During tea Richie meets his spoiled cousin Reggie Van Dough who wishes that he was as rich as Richie
Later he dresses up like an elf with Cadbury as Santa Claus to distribute Christmas presents to the orphanage
While getting ready Cadbury tells Richie about how he was a rock star in his youth days in a band called Root Canal
When they take off in the sleigh with Richie driving it Reggie takes control of it using a remote invented by Keanbean
He guides it through streets by shops houses and people thus nearly destroying everything in the whole process
Richie and Cadbury end up in an accident in which the sleigh falls and literally explodes along with the presents while Cadbury hurts his ankle badly
Richie runs off to fetch help but once he enters the city he sees that the situation has changed dramatically
Reggie is cooking up rumors about him and all the people have turned against him
Devastated Richie goes into Keanbean s laboratory and squats in front of the wishing machine
While fretting over his ill luck he accidentally wishes that he was never born
The machine at once grants his wish following which he is transported to another world in which he was never born and hence nobody recognizes him
Reggie has taken over as Richard and Regina s son and is now the richest kid in the world
He bosses around everyone
Roads and buildings are named after him
This world is very sad and hunger and misery are seen all over
This makes Richie realize that things would not be better if he was not born and hence decides to go back to the world in which he is Richie Rich
Though his parents do not recognize him anymore he is happy that his dog Dollar does
He takes Dollar with him only to enrage Reggie who is his current owner
Reggie orders policemen to search for Richie who is falsely called the dognapper and also announces a reward for catching him
After outsmarting various policemen who try but fail to catch him Richie finds Cadbury who is still part of Root Canal and Keanbean who runs his own laboratory called Keanbean s World of Wonders
Richie questions Keanbean about the wishing machine which he says requires a Pegliasaurus wishing bone in order to be complete
Along with his friends who decide to help him Richie goes to the city museum to retrieve the bone from the dinosaur skeleton
After passing through laser detection systems successfully they get it using the fishing rod invented by Keanbean
Before they get out of the museum Richie and his friends spot Reggie s parents who are now working as night guards there
Once they reach the lab they get the machine to work properly
However before Richie could wish himself back Reggie arrives there with the policemen
Richie Cadbury Keanbean and Richie s friends are put in jail while Reggie takes the machine home
At home Reggie wishes that he could fly and then when Irona his robotic servant maid accidentally turns off the machine he tries to make a wish again
When it does not work the second time he leaves the room in a huff and retires
In jail Richie and his friends are bailed out by root canal
They all rush to Reggie s house and while he is still sleeping Richie tries to wish himself back
However they find that the machine is no longer working as Reggie had kicked it in anger earlier
While Keanbean is fixing it Reggie wakes up and comes flying in only to be attacked by Richie and his friends
They defeat him and everyone quits working for him with the police chief refusing to work for someone who would cancel Christmas
After that the machine starts working again and Richie wishes himself back as Richie Rich
Richie sets right all the things that had gone wrong since his vanishing act and is now much more grateful to be alive
As everyone is glad to have him back they gather around the Christmas tree and sing
Extended TV Ending Reggie is caught red handed with his actions against Richie and apologies for all the trouble he caused to Richie admitting that he was the one who took control of the sleigh and ruined the event
Richie realizes that it wasn t his fault and he made that wish for nothing
They forgive each other

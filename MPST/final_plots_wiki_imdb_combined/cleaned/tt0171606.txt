Like all Tex Murphy games The Pandora Directive takes place in post World War III San Francisco in April 2043
After the devastating events of WWIII many major cities have been rebuilt though certain areas still remain as they were before the war
WWIII also left another mark on the world the formation of two classes of citizens
Specifically the Mutants and the Norms
After the events of Under a Killing Moon tensions between the two groups have begun to diminish
The end to the Crusade for Genetic Purity was a turning point in the relations between Mutants and Norms
Tex still lives on Chandler Ave which recently underwent a city funded cleanup
The events of WWIII still left the planet with no ozone layer and to protect their citizens many countries adopted a time reversal
Instead of sleeping at night and being awake in the day humans have become nocturnal in a manner of speaking
Though Tex lives in what is considered a Mutant area of town he himself is a Norm
In The Pandora Directive after accidentally offending his love interest Chelsee Bando Tex is hired by Gordon Fitzpatrick to find his friend Thomas Malloy
He learns that Malloy stayed at the Ritz and decides to follow up the lead after reconciling with Chelsee and agreeing to go for dinner with her at her apartment
Upon investigating Malloy s room Tex is knocked out by a mysterious masked figure dressed in black
Tex is out through the night inadvertently missing his date with Chelsee
After finding out that a female acquaintance of Malloy works at the Fuchsia Flamingo club Tex offers to take Chelsee there to both apologise and hopefully to check out the lead
Regardless of whether Chelsee comes out with Tex or not she will decide to take a vacation to Phoenix for a few days
At the club Tex meets with the girl Emily who agrees to trade information on Malloy if Tex can find out who is stalking her
She gives a note she received from her stalker to Tex and upon showing it to his connection in the police station Mac Malden Tex finds out that Emily is being observed by the Black Arrow Killer
Tex is able to discover that the NSA is involved and looking for Malloy and breaks into one of their headquarters Autotech
He finds out that the NSA are using video surveillance to monitor the goings on in Emily s room at the Fuchsia Flamingo
Tex finds the source of this and sees a figure dresses similarly to the person who attacked him in Mallory s room waiting to confront Emily
Tex hurries over to the club and is able to get there just in time to see the Killer jump out of the window carrying a small box
Tex chases him down and in the ensuing fight accidentally causes the Killer to fall off the roof and die
Tex removes the Killer s mask and sees that it is NSA agent Dag Horton who had an office in Autotech
Tex is pulled in for questioning by the police but is allowed to leave when an unknown woman enters the station and speaks to Mac
Tex retrieves the box that Horton stole from Emily s room but is seized by the NSA and taken to Jackson Cross s office at Autotech
He is threatened to stay out of their affairs and is forced to hand over the box
Returning to his office Tex is met by the woman who talked the police into letting him go
She reveals her name is Regan Madsen she is Thomas Malloy s daughter and that Malloy sent out several boxes like the one Tex found
Tex goes to the Fuchsia Flamingo and finds out that Emily is Malloy s wife hence her being sent a box
using the return address on the packaging Tex is finally able to track down Malloy in a run down warehouse in the industrial district
After establishing that Tex is not with the NSA he reveals that he used to work at Roswell the military base where a spacecraft allegedly crashed in 1947
Malloy asserts that the crash was legitimate and that the government covered the story up
The military began investigating then wreckage to look for weapons and in the 1980s Malloy came into the project to attempt to decipher the hieroglyphics on the craft
After World War 3 Malloy left the project but was able to continue his research in secret
Before Malloy can continue his story two NSA agents arrive and kill him
Tex is able to escape by blowing the building up
Tex fills a disheartened Fitzpatrick in on the events but insists on following up on the details he has uncovered
Fitzpatrick tells him that he worked with Malloy in Roswell and that after becoming close friends Malloy confided in him that he had been deciphering the alien hieroglyphics and had discovered that a second spacecraft had crashed somewhere on Earth
He then reveals that he received one of Malloy s boxes and there are probably about 6 in circulation
Tex meets with Regan to tell her about her father and she agrees to give him her box despite reservations that Tex will open it and sell off the information for himself
After stealing Horton s personal effects from the morgue where his body is being held Tex is able to get into Autotech s evidence room to recover Emily s box
Tex travels to the Cosmic Connection shop and speaks to Archie Ellis an eccentric comic book nerd and ufologist who recently interviewed Malloy
Archie tells him that the famous author Elijah Witt set up the interview between them during which Malloy made several cryptic references to something called The Pandora Device
He also reveals that during their research into the alien crafts at Roswell the scientists accidentally released something into the facility that proceeded to kill off practically everyone in the complex before the military moved in and quarantined the entire base
Archie tells Tex that Malloy sent him one of the boxes but it was stolen and that the alien power cell in a picture from one of the other boxes is still stored in the Roswell complex
Tex travels to Roswell and enters the deserted site but whilst moving around the facility becomes increasingly aware that he is being stalked
It is revealed that the alien entity released by the researchers many years before is still lurking in the complex but Tex is able to seal it off in a containment pod before he suffers that same fate and is then able to secure the power cell from the security room
Tex is able to break the code on a disc Malloy sent to Elijah Witt on which Malloy reveals that each of the boxes sent out contains a piece of the Pandora Device and that assembling the parts will reveal the information Malloy had discovered
After obtaining all the relevant pieces Tex summons Fitzpatrick Regan and Witt to his office where he assembles the Pandora Device
A hologram of Malloy appears and tells the group that there was indeed another spacecraft that landed on Earth and that Malloy discovered its location
He hypothesises that the ship contains large amounts of anti hydrogen on board and that if this gets into the wrong hands it could result in the destruction of life on Earth
Witt immediately decides that the ship must be destroyed but Regan is adamant that they could sell the technology off for big money
Regardless the four decide that they must find the craft so they each take a separate route to the location Malloy specified
Tex arrives and manages to navigate his way through a dense jungle and an ancient Mayan labyrinth in which he comes across Regan who set off earlier in hope she might get there first
Tex and Regan find the ship but Jackson Cross arrives and it revealed that Regan and Cross had been working together all along
Before Cross is able to kill Tex Fitzpatrick emerges from the ship and invites the three on board
Fitzpatrick shows them around and offers to show them the central power core before locking Regan and Cross inside but not before Cross fires his gun and hits Fitzpatrick
As he is dying Fitzpatrick reveals that he knows how to work the controls of the ship as his father was one of the aliens from the ship his mother was a human woman from Nebraska hence Fitzpatrick s human appearance
After urging Tex to type in the correct controls he dies from his wound and Tex quickly exits the ship just in time for it to ascend into space and self destruct
Tex is picked up by a late arriving Elijah Witt and taken home

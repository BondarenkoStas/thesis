The story takes place in 1671
In the prelude to the Franco Dutch War a financially struggling Louis Grand Condé is visited by King Louis XIV for three days of festivities at the Château de Chantilly
The Prince wants a commission as a general and spares no expense in order to impress the king
In charge of organizing the event is François Vatel Master of Festivities and Pleasures in the prince s household
Vatel is a man of great honor and talent but of low birth
As the great Condé is prepared to do anything in his quest for stature the tasks assigned to Vatel are often menial and dishonourable
While Vatel tries to sustain dignity amidst the extravaganza he is meant to orchestrate he finds himself in love with Anne de Montausier the king s latest lover who returns his affections
However due to their incompatible social standing and the rigid hierarchy of the court continuing the liaison is clearly impossible
In the last day of the visit by the King Louis XIV Vatel realizes that he is nothing more than a puppet in the hands of his superiors bought and sold like a piece of property after learning that the Prince of Condé has lost him in a card game with the King
Disheartened and refusing to leave his people and go to work for the King Vatel consequently commits suicide by throwing himself on his sword
Nevertheless the word that goes to the King by his own court members is that Vatel killed himself because the roast was not sufficient to feed several unexpected guests the clouds dulled the fireworks display and he lacked confidence that there would be enough fish for the morning meal
This explanation pleases the King very much
Anne de Montausier is grief stricken upon hearing the news but knows she must not speak of it
In doing so she flees the court quietly and no one ever hears about her and Vatel again

Just before dinner Pajama Sam is whisked away by his Choc Amok cookies to the sugar sweets and fats party in Mop Top Island
After devouring the huge piece of cake in front of the doorway Sam decides to finally leave the party saying he doesn t want to spoil his dinner
All the sugar sweets and fats while referring to him as healthy boy are immediately offended as they have to send him off to the candy cane jail until releasing him on his trial set for later next month
While in the candy cane jail Pajama Sam meets a broccoli named Florette and a delegate of the food group peace conference
Pajama Sam manages to free Florette and himself from the sweet s prison
Pajama Sam follows Florette to the food pyramid and meets his familiar friend Carrot who was leading the peace conference
Carrot explains to Pajama Sam that General Beetfoot will declare war unless the conference goes on
Unfortunately four other delegates are missing
Pajama Sam needs to locate these other delegates and get them out of trouble before the General notices they are missing and declares war
After all the delegates are rescued Sam goes to the peace conference but instead of finding the six delegates working together he finds them arguing over which food group is better and then after hearing enough of the delegates arguing Sam yells and then gives an inspiring speech about working together

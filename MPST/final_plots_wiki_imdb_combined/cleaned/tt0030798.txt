Two Royal Air Force officers Flt Lt Hallett and F O Neil Allison visit a British outpost in India
Neil is the younger brother of Army Intelligence Officer Captain Jeffrey Allison who is away on an undercover mission in the unaligned and independent Princely state of Lhanapur
The British are worried about radio broadcasts from Ramin Khan inciting the Indian people to revolt
Upon the death of the elderly Maharajah of Lhanapur Ramin Khan schemes to usurp the throne as a base for his revolt
Disguised as an Indian holy man Jeffrey gathers intelligence on Ramin Khan s insurgents whilst the British send a diplomatic mission to Lhanapur who are ambushed and killed
The young Neil is himself in love with Jeffrey s fiancee Joan Lattimore and is jealous of his brother
Upon his return from Lhanapur Jeffrey postpones his wedding so Joan can flee to safety
With the death of the diplomatic party Jeffrey is flown to Lhanapur by Hallett in his aircraft to meet with the Maharajah
Ramin Khan captures Jeffrey and mortally wounds Hallett who flies back to inform the British of Ramin Khan s activity
Ramin Khan is delighted as he plans to ambush the British field force in a ravine near the caves of Kali

Zarina a very smart and inquisitive pixie dust keeper fairy is amazed by the magic behind pixie dust and is determined to find out all that it is capable of
After her secretly experimenting with some blue pixie dust and causing an accident in Pixie Hollow her supervisor Fairy Gary prohibits her from being a dust keeper
In sorrow Zarina takes her experiments and runs away from Pixie Hollow
One year later Pixie Hollow celebrates the Four Seasons Festival with performances from fairies of all the seasons
During the show Tinker Bell Silvermist Iridessa Rosetta Fawn and Vidia spot Zarina flying around the audience and using some strange pixie dust to summon several poppies that cause everyone to fall asleep except Tink and her friends who take cover
After Zarina is gone they realize that she stole all of the blue pixie dust the only way to make the yellow dust that the fairies use to fly so they go after her to return it to its rightful place
They follow Zarina to the coast where it is revealed that she became the captain of a pirate crew including the cabin boy James Hook
The fairies manage to retrieve the blue dust for a moment but Zarina gets it back after throwing at them some multicolored pixie dust that magically switches their innate fairy abilities and talents
Tinker Bell becomes a water fairy Silvermist becomes a fast flying fairy Fawn becomes a light fairy Iridessa becomes a garden fairy Rosetta becomes an animal fairy and Vidia becomes a tinker fairy much to her horror and disgust
They struggle with their swapped talents as they search for Zarina and the pirate ship in the process meeting a baby crocodile which takes a liking to Rosetta
They find the ship and sneak in where they hear James saying how the pirates met Zarina after drifting off course and she became the captain with the promise of making the ship fly so that they could plunder anything without getting caught
The ship arrives at Skull Rock where the fairies discover the pirates camp and a mysterious Pixie Dust Tree which Zarina had grown using pink colored pixie dust of the garden talent
The fairies attempt to retrieve the blue pixie dust but are caught when Iridessa loses control over her nature earth based talent and reveals their location
Tink tries to convince Zarina to return home to Pixie Hollow but she refuses as no one appreciates her unusual talents in dust keeping which eventually led her to leave
With the fairies now captured the pirates begin making pixie dust which becomes successful
Hook curious about what it s like to fly convinces Zarina to use some on him with the result that he begins to fly
After joyfully flying around the cave Hook double crosses Zarina and traps her in a lantern revealing he is the real captain of the pirate crew and that he has merely been using her all along to get the pixie dust for his own purposes of getting to the second star to plunder around the seven seas of Neverland
Tinker Bell and the others attempt to escape their prison without any success until the baby crocodile Rosetta befriended arrives and releases them
The fairies attempt once more to retrieve the blue pixie dust and almost succeed before being confronted by Hook who threatens to throw Zarina into the sea unless they hand the blue pixie dust over
Tink willingly gives the pixie dust up and Hook sprinkles it over the ship before throwing Zarina into the water leaving the fairies to rescue her
As the pirates sail towards the Second Star the fairies return and use their switched talents to defeat the pirates and turn the ship away from the Second Star
Zarina attempts to retrieve the blue pixie dust from Hook who chases after her
Zarina manages to gain a speck of blue pixie dust which she then throws at Hook who starts flying crazily as the two kinds of pixie dust react to each other
As the fairies fly away Hook angrily swears revenge on them until he is attacked by the baby crocodile leaving his crew members to laugh at him much to his dismay
Zarina returns the blue pixie dust to Tink and her friends before preparing to leave
However she is offered the chance to return to Pixie Hollow and this time accepts and helps her friends to sail the ship back to Pixie Hollow where the others are waking up with no recollection of what had happened
Zarina promises not to tamper and experiment with pixie dust again but is convinced by Tink to show off her astoundingly profound pixie dust abilities one last time
Zarina does so and in the process gives Tink and her friends back their original fairy talents allowing them to put on a beautiful performance to the audience at the Four Seasons Festival
Everyone rushes over to congratulate them particularly Zarina whose unusually strong and rare talent of pixie dust alchemy is finally accepted and can be who she is
Upon an extra scene during the end credits of the film a drifting Captain Hook comes across an unknown ship at sea
One of the crew members Smee comes to greet him
Taking no notice of Smee s words Hook orders to be pulled up into the ship

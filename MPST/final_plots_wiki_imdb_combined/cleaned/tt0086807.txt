At the time he wrote The Spitting Image Lembcke had not found a single substantiated media report to support the now common claims of spitting
He theorizes that the reported spitting on soldiers scenario was a mythical projection by those who felt spat upon by an American society tired of the war an image which was then used to discredit future antiwar activism and serve political interests
He suggests that the manufactured images of pro war antipathy against antiwar protesters also helped contribute to the myth
Lembcke asserts that memories of being verbally and physically assaulted by antiwar protesters were largely conjured noting that not even one case could be reliably documented
He further suggests the baby killer and murderer components of the myth may have been reinforced in part by the common chants by protesters aimed at President Lyndon Baines Johnson like Hey hey LBJ how many kids did you kill today
The Spitting Image asserts that the image of abuse of soldiers by antiwar demonstrators only really became ingrained in the American consciousness years after the war had come to a close
Lembcke attributes part of the legend s growth to films relating to Vietnam notably Rambo in which a spat upon veteran image is popularized
He writes that the myth of the spat upon veteran was later revived by President George H W Bush as a way to help suppress dissent when selling the Gulf War to the American people
Lembcke believes that resurrection of the myth was useful in promoting the yellow ribbon Support our Troops campaign as it implies that for one to support the troops one must also support the war
It conflates the ideas of antiwar sentiment and anti troop sentiment despite a common antiwar chant being Support the Troops Bring them Home
The spat upon veteran meme became so pervasive that some found it hard not to believe
In 1989 Bob Greene s book Homecoming reprinted letters he had solicited asking to hear from veterans if they had been spat upon
Greene s book includes 63 alleged accounts involving spitting and 69 accounts from veterans who do not believe anyone was spat upon after returning from Vietnam among other stories
Greene admits he couldn t validate the authenticity of the accounts in the letters he received but he did believe spitting must have occurred stating There were simply too many letters going into too fine a detail to deny the fact
Greene concluded I think you will agree after reading the letters that even if several should prove to be not what they appear to be that does not detract from the overall story that is being told
Greene was too willing to suspend disbelief says Lembcke who cited Greene s book as an example of how prolific the stories had become and also for the patterns that appeared in them
Lembke said These stories have to be taken very seriously but as historical evidence they are problematic
In the first place stories of this type didn t surface until about ten years after the end of the war
If the incidents occurred when the story tellers say they did in the closing years of the war why is there no evidence for that
Moreover many of the stories have elements of such exaggeration that one has to question the veracity of the entire account
Lembcke points out that there were several newspaper accounts of pro war demonstrators spitting on antiwar demonstrators and suggests that these oral accounts could easily have been reinterpreted and inverted and made into stories about activists spitting on veterans
He highlights the contradictions between the collective memory of today and contemporaneous historical records like the results from a 1971 poll showing over 94 of returning Vietnam soldiers received a friendly welcome
Lembcke also notes how it was older vets from previous wars who most often scorned the returning Vietnam Vets in 1978 the Vietnam Veterans of America vowed in its founding principle Never again will one generation of veterans abandon another
In The Spitting Image Lembcke acknowledges that he cannot prove the negative that no Vietnam veteran was ever spat on saying it is hard to imagine there not being expressions of hostility between veterans and activists
I cannot of course prove to anyone s satisfaction that spitting incidents like these did not happen
Indeed it seems likely to me that it probably did happen to some veteran some time some place
But while I cannot prove the negative I can prove the positive I can show what did happen during those years and that that historical record makes it highly unlikely that the alleged acts of spitting occurred in the number and manner that is now widely believed

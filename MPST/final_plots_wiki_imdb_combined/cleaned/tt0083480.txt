Maria Andreyevna Ostrakova a Soviet émigrée in Paris is told by a Soviet agent calling himself Kursky that her daughter Alexandra whom she was forced to leave behind may be permitted to join her for humanitarian reasons
Maria eagerly applies for French citizenship for her daughter but time passes with no sign of Alexandra and no further contact with Kursky
Realising she has been duped Maria writes to General Vladimir a former Soviet general and British agent for help
Vladimir immediately realises that Maria was unwittingly used to provide a legend or false identity for an unknown young woman a ploy which KGB spymaster Karla has fruitlessly tried before
Vladimir also recognises that the operation is wholly unofficial because Karla uses blundering amateur agents instead of trained intelligence officers
Vladimir contacts Toby Esterhase his old handler and postman in the Circus but Esterhase has left the service and refuses to be involved in Vladimir s plans
Nevertheless Vladimir sends a confidant Otto Leipzig to interview Maria in Paris
From a photograph Maria immediately identifies Kursky
Vladimir then sends the son of an old friend to Hamburg to collect vital proof from Leipzig
He contacts the Circus again invoking Moscow Rules and insisting on speaking to his former vicar or senior case officer George Smiley not realising that Smiley is also retired
The Circus personnel unfamiliar with Vladimir are sceptical and uncooperative
Meanwhile Vladimir s activities are betrayed to Karla probably by jealous members of Vladimir s émigré organisation
Vladimir is assassinated on Hampstead Heath evidently by Moscow Centre agents while on his way to meet an inexperienced handler from the Circus
New Circus head Saul Enderby and Civil Service undersecretary Oliver Lacon believe that Vladimir was merely an obscure ex agent seeking attention and want to bury the matter quickly to protect the Circus from any scandal
They recall Smiley from his forced retirement in the hope that he will erase any links to the Circus
Unlike Enderby and Lacon Smiley takes Vladimir s claims seriously and begins to investigate
He manages to recover a second letter sent to Vladimir by Maria who is now being shadowed and fears for her life
Near the site where Vladimir was killed he discovers Vladimir s half empty packet of Gauloises cigarettes containing the negative of a compromising photograph of Leipzig and another man with prostitutes
Smiley recalls that Leipzig had often blackmailed a venal Soviet agent named Oleg Kirov to obtain information and surmises that Kirov is probably the other man in the photograph
Meanwhile Soviet agents bungle an attempt to kill Maria
Smiley consults dying former Circus researcher Connie Sachs who remembers some background information on Kirov also known by the cover name Kursky
Following Vladimir s logic that Karla was acting outside the dedicated system he himself devised Connie also recounts rumours that Karla had a daughter by a mistress whom he had later sent to the Gulag when she turned against him
The daughter Tatiana who grew up without a mother and with a father she never knew became mentally unstable and was subsequently confined to a mental institution
Smiley flies to Hamburg where he hopes to learn the rest of the story
He tracks down Claus Kretzschmar an old associate of Leipzig and owner of the seedy night club where the photograph was taken
Kretzschmar gives him directions to Leipzig s temporary address on a boat in a gypsy encampment on the Baltic Sea near Lübeck but two of Karla s agents have already tortured and killed Leipzig
Smiley s search of Leipzig s boat uncovers what Karla s agents did not the torn half of a postcard hidden underwater in an old gym shoe on a fishing line
His discovery is witnessed by several people and his rental car is damaged by two boys
Smiley rushes to finish his work in Lübeck before German police and Soviet agents close in on him
Here Smiley appears as the spy of old and a master of tradecraft
He takes the half of the postcard to Kretzschmar who matches it to the other half and in exchange gives Smiley a tape recording made at the time the photograph of Leipzig and Kirov was taken and a photocopy of Maria s first letter to Vladimir
Smiley lays a false trail in the direction of London and then hastens by train and ferry to Copenhagen from where he flies to Paris fearing for Maria s life
With help from his old friend and former lieutenant Peter Guillam who is serving out his days in the British embassy in Paris Smiley gets Maria to safety
He also learns that Kirov has been summoned back to Moscow and has probably been killed for his indiscretions
Smiley returns to London and meets in secret with Enderby
The transcribed tape of Kirov s confession to Leipzig shows that Karla is secretly diverting funds to a Swiss bank account and misappropriating other resources using a commercial attaché of the Soviet embassy in Bern named Grigoriev
The money is going to the care of Karla s daughter who has been committed to an expensive Swiss psychiatric sanatorium under the faked citizenship papers of Maria s daughter
Smiley explains that if the Circus can obtain proof of this activity they may have the information necessary to blackmail Karla and force him to either defect or be exposed
Unexpectedly Enderby gives Smiley approval and secret and deniable funding to mount an operation to secure the evidence from Grigoriev and close the trap on Karla
While Smiley does research at the Circus Esterhase sets up a covert team in Bern to keep Grigoriev under observation
Smiley then visits his estranged wife Ann and makes a point of cutting all relations with her as he prepares to face down his greatest foe
Smiley recognises how ruthless he must become if he is to be Karla s nemesis
In Bern Smiley learns that like Kirov Grigoriev is untrained in spycraft and hopeless at concealment
Esterhase s team soon gains ample evidence of his unofficial handling of funds for Karla and his affair with one of his secretaries
Although Grigoriev is normally accompanied everywhere by his wife he makes an informal trip by himself to Bern where Esterhase and his helpers take the opportunity to bundle him into a car
He is then subjected to Smiley s expert interrogation and given the choice of cooperating or being thrown to the mercy of Swiss authorities and later Karla
Grigoriev quickly confesses all he knows of the arrangements regarding Alexandra s care and the details of the visits he makes to her
Smiley visits Alexandra who is being treated in an institution run by an order of nuns
Among her symptoms is her insistence that she is actually called Tatiana and is the daughter of a powerful man who can make people disappear but who does not actually exist
Smiley writes a letter to Karla which Grigoriev passes on instead of his usual weekly report on Alexandra s treatment
The letter details Karla s illegal activities and offers him the stark choice between defection to the West and protection for Tatiana or his destruction at the hands of his rivals in Moscow Centre
In a final scene Karla posing as a labourer defects using a bridge connecting East and West Berlin
Before crossing over into the waiting arms of Western agents Karla stops and lights a cigarette
As he passes near Smiley he drops a gold cigarette lighter a gift to George from Ann that he purloined from Smiley years earlier in an Indian prison
Smiley fails to pick up the lighter another sign that he has become that which he resisted for so long

During the body of the short mayhem ensues as Mater is pursued by the Ghostlight ultimately revealed to be just a lantern affixed to Mater s towing cable by Lightning and Guido
He drives into Willy s Butte and wakes Frank and his tractors and goes into slow motion where he sounds like a bull
The other residents of Radiator Springs watch as Mater drives around frantically with the Ghostlight on his tail before Mater tires himself out and discovers the truth
The cars tell him it was all a prank to pay him back for all his pranks he played on them
Sheriff gently tells Mater that the only thing to be scared of on Route 66 is his imagination

In 1932 the dawn of the Great Depression young baseball fan Yankee Irving whose father Stanley works as a janitor for New York City s Yankee Stadium dreams of playing for the New York Yankees but can t even play sandlot baseball well enough to avoid being picked last
One day beside the sandlot he finds and befriends a talking baseball he names Screwie
While father and son are in the stadium a thief steals Babe Ruth s famous bat Darlin
Yankee s father who was working his shift at the time is blamed and accordingly fired
The true thief is Lefty Maginnis a pitcher for the Chicago Cubs
Lefty works for Cubs owner Napoleon Cross who desires to see the Cubs defeat the Yankees during the 1932 World Series
Stealing the bat back Yankee decides to return it to Ruth and thereby exonerate his father by journeying across the country to Chicago where the next World Series games will be played
Darlin is able to speak as does her counterpart Screwie with whom she constantly argues and bickers
Much of the plot is driven by Lefty s comic attempts to retrieve the bat from Yankee with slapstick results
Other scenes involve Yankee meeting others who will help him in his quest several hobos Marti an African American girl her baseball player father Lonnie Brewster and in Chicago Babe Ruth himself
A series of improbable coincidences allows Yankee himself to bat for the Yankees resulting in the archetypal home run
This restores the morale of the Yankees who score 7 more runs to take the lead and win the World Series
Cross tries to talk Babe Ruth out of accepting the victory saying that Yankee is too young to be eligible to play
This leads to the arrest of Cross and also Lefty
Yankee also successfully exonerates his father
Yankee returns home now knowing what is truly important in baseball

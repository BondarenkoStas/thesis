Set in the World of Darkness the game depicts a world in which vampires werewolves demons and other creatures shape human history
The vampires are bound by a code to maintain their secrecy and avoid unnecessary killing
The vampires are divided into seven clans of the Camarilla the vampire government with distinctive traits and abilities
The Toreadors are the closest to humanity with a passion for culture the Ventrue are noble powerful leaders the Brujah are idealists who excel at fighting the Malkavians are cursed with insanity or blessed with insight the Gangrel are loners in sync with their animalistic nature the secretive untrustworthy Tremere wield blood magic and the monstrous Nosferatu are condemned to a life in the shadows to avoid humanity
The clans are loosely united by their belief in the Camarilla s goals and opposition to the Sabbat vampires who revel in their nature embracing the beast within
The Anarchs are a faction of idealistic vampires opposed to the Camarilla s political structure believing that power should be shared by all vampires
The main character of Bloodlines whom the player controls is an unnamed fledgling vampire transformed at the start of a game and belonging to one of the clans

Plot The game begins with the player character an unnamed human being killed and resurrected as a fledgling vampire
For this unauthorized act the fledgling and their Sire are brought before the Camarilla
The Sire is executed by order of LaCroix the fledgling is spared the same fate by the intervention of the Anarch Nines Rodriguez and employed by the prince
LaCroix sends the fledgling to Santa Monica to help his ghoul Mercurio destroy a Sabbat warehouse
Following his success the fledgling travels to downtown Los Angeles meeting separately with Nines LaCroix and Jack
LaCroix tasks the player with investigating a docked ship the Elizabeth Dane for information about an Ankaran sarcophagus rumored to contain the body of an Antediluvian one of the oldest and most powerful vampires whose arrival would herald the vampire apocalypse Gehenna
The fledgling discovers that the sarcophagus seems to have been opened from within
Increased Sabbat activity coincides with the disappearance of the Malkavian chief Alistair Grout
At Grout s mansion the fledgling sees Nines leaving and discovers Grout s remains in the mansion with vampire hunter Grunfeld Bach who denies involvement in Grout s death
Learning about Nines presence at the mansion LaCroix tells the other chiefs to approve Nines execution
The fledgling is sent to the Museum of Natural History to recover the sarcophagus but finds that it has been stolen
Jack later suggests to the fledgling that LaCroix wants the sarcophagus to drink the blood of the ancient within gaining its power
Believing that Gary the Nosferatu chief has stolen the sarcophagus the fledgling is sent to Hollywood to find him after locating a captured Nosferatu for Gary he reveals that the sarcophagus was stolen by the Giovanni vampire clan
The fledgling infiltrates the Giovanni mansion and finds the sarcophagus guarded by the Kuei Jin who claim their leader Ming Xiao has formed an alliance with LaCroix
The locked sarcophagus is returned to LaCroix s tower and Beckett a vampire historian tells the fledgling that the only person who can open it has been abducted by Grunfeld to lure LaCroix
The fledgling kills Grunfeld and learns that the sarcophagus key has been stolen
They return to LaCroix learning that the Sabbat tried to steal the sarcophagus to destroy it and prevent Gehenna and kill the Sabbat leader to disperse his followers
The fledgling is met by Ming Xiao who offers to form an alliance
Ming Xiao reveals that she has the key and LaCroix killed Grout to prevent his powerful insight from unveiling LaCroix s plans Ming Xiao changed into Nines at the mansion to frame him
Denying Ming Xiao s claims LaCroix rescinds the blood hunt on Nines and entrusts the fledgling with recruiting the Anarchs to punish the Kuei Jin for murdering Grout
The fledgling finds Nines hiding in the forest and they are then attacked by a werewolf and Nines is badly injured
The fledgling escapes with Jack who reveals that LaCroix has issued an execution order on the fledgling for framing Nines on orders from Ming Xiao
The end varies depending on whom if anyone the fledgling allies with
If the fledgling supports LaCroix or Ming Xiao each sends the fledgling to kill the other
LaCroix opens the sarcophagus to be killed with the fledgling by hidden explosives Ming Xiao betrays the fledgling chaining them to the sarcophagus and sinking it in the ocean
Supporting the Anarchs or no one makes the fledgling kill Ming Xiao and maim LaCroix who is killed after he opens the sarcophagus
If the fledgling opens the sarcophagus they die in the explosion
If the fledgling is a Tremere they kill Ming Xiao LaCroix is replaced by Tremere leader Maximillian Strauss and the sarcophagus is stored
Each ending has Jack watching from afar with the mummy taken from the coffin and the enigmatic taxi driver who transports the fledgling between locations who says The blood of Caine controls our fate Farewell vampire

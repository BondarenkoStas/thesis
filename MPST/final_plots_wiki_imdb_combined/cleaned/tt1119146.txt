Below is a synopsis based on the original 1892 libretto by Marius Petipa
The story varies from production to production though most follow the basic outline
The names of the characters also vary
In the original E T A
Hoffmann story the young heroine is called Marie Stahlbaum and Clara is her doll s name
In the adaptation by Dumas on which Petipa based his libretto her name is Marie Silberhaus
In still other productions such as Baryshnikov s Clara is Clara Stahlbaum rather than Clara Silberhaus
Act I Scene 1 The Stahlbaum Home It is Christmas Eve
Family and friends have gathered in the parlor to decorate the beautiful Christmas tree in preparation for the party
Once the tree is finished the children are sent for
They stand in awe of the tree sparkling with candles and decorations
The party begins
A march is played
Presents are given out to the children
Suddenly as the owl topped grandmother clock strikes eight a mysterious figure enters the room
It is Drosselmeyer a local councilman magician and Clara s godfather
He is also a talented toymaker who has brought with him gifts for the children including four lifelike dolls who dance to the delight of all
He then has them put away for safekeeping

Fritz however accidentally breaks it
Clara is heartbroken
During the night after everyone else has gone to bed Clara returns to the parlor to check on her beloved nutcracker
As she reaches the little bed the clock strikes midnight and she looks up to see Drosselmeyer perched atop it
Suddenly mice begin to fill the room and the Christmas tree begins to grow to dizzying heights
The nutcracker also grows to life size
Clara finds herself in the midst of a battle between an army of gingerbread soldiers and the mice led by their king
They begin to eat the soldiers
The nutcracker appears to lead the soldiers who are joined by tin ones and dolls who serve as doctors to carry away the wounded
As the Mouse King advances on the still wounded nutcracker Clara throws her slipper at him distracting him long enough for the nutcracker to stab him

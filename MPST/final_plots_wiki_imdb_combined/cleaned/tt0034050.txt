Porky Pig has arranged the screening of a film in a film theater for an audience of barnyard animals
The public goes to the ticket booth
A chicken buys tickets for herself and her three children
A kangaroo tears the tickets and throws them in his pouch
A firefly usher leads the audience with his hindquarters as a bright lamp
A skunk has a scent and cannot enter so he goes through the back door
On stage Porky presents the film he made himself
The accompanying music is a version of the flickering that usually introduced cartoons of Looney Tunes
The film turns out to be a series of small sketches of primitive characters drawn wire stick figures minimalist with settings that seem to have been penciled by a child
After the film Porky is surprised to see the theatre in shambles the only audience that remaining is the skunk
The skunk enthusiastically applauds Porky s film having enjoyed it because it too stinks

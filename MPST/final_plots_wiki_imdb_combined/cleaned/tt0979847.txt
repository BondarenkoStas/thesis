After a chance meeting at a Chen Jin Lang concert and coached by their seamstress Little Papaya s Aunt Ling Yi the Papaya sisters struggle at first because they have no feel in their voices
As a last resort they appeal to Aunt Ling s estranged twin sister the Goddess of Getai for help
She grants them their wish but warns them the price will be high especially if they do not obey the rules of Getai
One of the rules states that they shall not love or be loved by any man
The Papaya sisters hit the Getai circuit and sing their hearts out with their newfound feel
Big Papaya is pursuing her dream in spite of strong parental objections to the point of being kicked out of her house and is now living with Aunt Ling and Little Papaya
Little Papaya being an orphan is in a personal race against time to realize her potential
Like her deceased parents Little Papaya suffers from cancer and has little time left
Through their perseverance hard work and Aunt Ling s amazing costumes the Papayas become the most popular sister act in town
They use their fame to help raise funds to help Chen Jin Lang who is also suffering from cancer
But they are soon devastated by the death of their idol
While Little Papaya grieves Big Papaya finds solace in the arms of Guan Yin Aunt Ling s mute son and their driver
Unknown to them rival sister group Durian Sisters have become intensely jealous of the Papayas success and are determined to trip them up by messing up their schedule
With the help of their gangster Godfather the Durians succeed in shutting the Papayas out of many Getai
They are ruthless in their underhand attacks on the Papayas using magical darts to hurt their rivals
Guan Yin cannot defend them and even the Goddess is appalled by the tactics employed by the Durians
Although she grants the Papayas whatever celestial powers she can bestow she warns them that there is a limit to what she can do
At a confrontation the Durians challenge the Papayas to a showdown
The stakes are high whoever loses will leave the getai scene for good
The Papayas accept and start preparing for the big day new costumes new songs new dances
The movie climaxes with a dramatic musical battle
Both sides pull out all the stops to win over the audience
Eventually Little Papaya collapses from the strain
Distraught Big Papaya begs the Goddess of Getai for assistance but receives none as she has broken the rule by being with Guan Yin
Little Papaya wastes away and eventually dies
Years later Big Papaya is still performing Getai
Guan Yin mentions that he looks forward to the Seventh Month more as that is the only time they can all be together

At an exclusive boarding school for girls Rebecca a sixteen year old teenage girl records her most intimate thoughts in a diary
Two years ago Rebecca s father a gloomy poet took his own life by slitting his wrists
Her mother transferred Rebecca to the school hoping to help her daughter escape the dark memories of her father s death
With the help of her best friend and roommate Lucy and many other girls Rebecca soon recovered
But this year will never be the same
A mysterious dark haired girl named Ernessa Bloch enrolls into the school
Lucy quickly becomes best friends with Ernessa and becomes distant from Rebecca
Ernessa s presence makes Rebecca feel uneasy
She tries to confront Lucy about Ernessa s dark secrets but her pleas are dismissed as pure jealousy
Eerie things start to happen
First Charley gets expelled because of Ernessa
Dora dies in a freak accident shortly after spying on Ernessa s room and a teacher is found murdered in the woods
Tension starts to grow at the school
To Rebecca Ernessa is an enigma
She seems like she can walk through closed windows and she is often seen lingering around the basement
Rebecca thinks Ernessa is a vampire
Ernessa slowly gets rid of Rebecca s close friends leaving Rebecca to find out what is happening by herself
A new English teacher Mr Davies arrives at the school
Mr Davies shows particular interest in Rebecca
The two share ideas on Romantic literature and poetry
Rebecca soon learns that vampires don t necessarily drink blood but they can drain the lively spirit out of their victims
Mr Davies addresses himself as a fan of Rebecca s poet father
Rebecca turns to Mr Davies for help but it is no use
During their conversation the two kiss but Rebecca pulls herself away
On several occasions Ernessa confronts Rebecca in the library and one time presents Rebecca with a sharp razor and elaborates on the pleasure of death
Another time Ernessa sings a disturbing nursery rhyme about The Juniper Tree then slits her own wrists causing blood to rain down on her and Rebecca
Afterwards Ernessa and the blood disappear
One day Lucy is sent to the hospital but only Rebecca knows that Lucy is sick because of Ernessa
Rebecca tries to convince Lucy that Ernessa is the root of all their problems but Lucy refuses to listen and profanes at her
Although Lucy recovers for a couple days she soon dies after Ernessa completely drains the life out of her
Rebecca steals the keys to the basement and after entering sees an old stone coffin with Ernessa s full name engraved on it
From an old diary Rebecca learns that many years ago Ernessa s father also killed himself and Ernessa unable to cope with the grief took her own life thereafter
Rebecca soon learns that for the whole time Ernessa has wanted Rebecca to kill herself
In other words Rebecca is the target victim and not Lucy
Shortly after Rebecca returns to the basement to discover Ernessa sleeping in the stone coffin
Rebecca pours kerosene on Ernessa and around the coffin she is still sleeping in lighting the kerosene before Ernessa wakes up
Rebecca then walks outside to see a fire truck present and her classmates standing around
Through a door she sees the ghost of Ernessa who slowly turns around and walks into the sun before vanishing
Narrating that the authorities are suspicious of her Rebecca is comfortable in the knowledge that Ernessa will not have left any remains
During her transportation to the police station she pulls a razor blade out of her diary and secretly drops it out of the car window deciding that she will not do the same as Ernessa
Rebecca looks blankly out of the car window as the film fades to black

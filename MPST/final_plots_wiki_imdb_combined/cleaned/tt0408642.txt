After Crash destroys Doctor Neo Cortex s space station and rescues Crunch Bandicoot from Cortex s control Cortex and Uka Uka escape and are preserved in ice in Antarctica
Three years later the ice that is preserving Cortex and Uka Uka is heading towards the Wumpa Island home of Crash and his family
Cortex escapes while Uka Uka is still frozen
As he tries to get his revenge on Crash he paralyzes Coco Bandicoot
Poorly disguised as Coco Cortex lures Crash over to a bay where he attacks Crash with the Mecha Bandicoot a gigantic mech
After this fails to defeat Crash the robot falls in a cave forcing Cortex into Crash and causing the pair to fall
Cortex infuriated over losing to Crash again attacks him and the duo fight roll all the way to the cave s exit
After getting out of the cave Crash and Cortex are confronted by a pair of odd turquoise parrot like creatures who proclaim themselves as The Evil Twins who have come to destroy the Wumpa Islands
When it is learned that they come from the Tenth Dimension Cortex proposes that he and Crash travel the islands in search of crystals needed to power the Psychetron a machine that will allow them travel to the Tenth Dimension
Crash and Cortex later face and defeat Uka Uka and is ultimately convinced by his brother Aku Aku to help him defeat the Twins
However they are easily defeated by the evil duo
Crash faces and defeats many of his old enemies during his quest including Doctor N Gin Doctor Nitrus Brio and Doctor Nefarious Tropy all three of which are interested in the treasure that the Evil Twins own
However after retrieving enough power crystals Cortex is confronted by Coco who believes he kidnapped Crash
Coco kicks Cortex jettisoning the crystals onto the Psychetron destroying it and paralyzing Coco again
In order to fix it Cortex and Crash travel to Madame Amberly s Academy of Evil in order to fetch Nina Cortex the only person who could do so
After defeating Dingodile and Madame Amberly it is later revealed that the Evil Twins are actually Cortex s former pet parrots Victor and Moritz mutated by the radiation present in the Tenth Dimension
Once Nina fixes the Psychetron she Crash and Cortex travel to the Tenth Dimension a bizarre and gloomy mirror universe version of Earth where Evil Crash the Tenth Dimension s version of Crash kidnaps Nina
Crash and Cortex escape Evil Crash and rescue Nina where they defeat the Evil Twins who are subsequently eaten alive by Evil Crash
The game ends with Cortex trying to use the Psychetron to get rid of Crash however it malfunctions and sends Cortex into Crash s mind
Cortex is horrified as he is surrounded by numerous personifications of Crash who start dancing
In the NTSC version if the player beats the game and collects all of the gems there is a secret cutscene where Crash and Cortex are sent to a psychiatrist
The psychiatrist tells the two to do a trust exercise Cortex s job is to fold his arms close his eyes and fall backwards while Crash s job is to catch Cortex when he falls
Cortex is reluctant to participate due to his distrust of Crash and his fear of falling but decides to go with the exercise
Unfortunately Crash is distracted by a Wumpa Fruit that falls on the floor and rolls past his feet and Cortex falls on his back
Crash glances at Cortex shrugs and proceeds to eat the Wumpa Fruit
The cutscene ends with Cortex grumbling Oh how I hate bandicoots

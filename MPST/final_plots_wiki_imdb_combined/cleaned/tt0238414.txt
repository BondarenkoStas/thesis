Later it is time for the boys to go to bed and having enjoyed the day immensely the boys then wish that it would be Christmas every day
Their wish is granted and at first the three are joyful
After a few days however they begin to get sick of Christmas and soon realize that every day will be exactly the same as the day when they first made their wish
They then decide to change the course of action of the next day by playing tricks and pranks including swapping the cooked turkey with a live one for the dinner table

After this the boys finally read the gift card that was given to them which they had previously disregarded
The card is from Donald and Daisy it wishes them love and explains that Christmas is not just about presents it is about being with family
The boys instantly become guilty for their pranks and decide to make amends by making the next day the best Christmas ever
At the end of the next day the boys finally realize the true meaning of Christmas and the time loop comes to an end leading into the day after Christmas
A Very Goofy Christmas Goofy and Max are mailing out a letter to Santa Claus
However as soon as they get home Pete the neighbor tells Max that Santa does not exist predicting how he can t fly around the world in one night
Things get worse when Goofy poses as Santa for some kids and Max finds out that he tricked him
Goofy is determined to prove to Max that Santa does exist and even stays up all Christmas Eve to keep an eye out for him
But after falling off the roof Goofy gives up hope of Santa coming
Now Max does everything that Goofy did to make his father happy including posing as Santa
In the end the real Santa actually comes and gives Max the gift the boy asked for earlier
This segment of Mickey s Once Upon a Christmas chronologically precedes the cartoon series Goof Troop
Max is voiced by Shaun Fleming of the indie rock bands Diane Coffee and Foxygen
Mickey and Minnie s The Gift of the Magi Based on the story The Gift of the Magi by O Henry
Mickey wants to get Minnie a gold chain for her one heirloom her watch so he works at Crazy Pete s Tree Lot
Minnie wants to give Mickey something special for Christmas as well so she works hard to get her special bonus
However Pete steals all of Mickey s money and fires him when he ruins his chance of selling an expensive 10 footer to a poor family and Minnie s bonus proves to be nothing but a fruit cake
After playing music for a toy drive with the Firehouse Five Mickey has the idea that he can trade his harmonica for the chain
The shop closes by the time he gets there and the owner rejects it thinking it s not worth anything but changes his mind after hearing its music
Back at Minnie s house Mickey gives her the chain for her watch and Minnie gives him a case for his harmonica
Of course the irony is that Minnie no longer has her watch just as Mickey no longer has his harmonica so the gifts are essentially useless
As in the classic Gift of the Magi upon which this adaptation penned by O Henry is based the thought behind each gift is what counts
The film concludes with a medley of various carols
In The Gift of Magi one of Mickey s dance moves are very similar to his dance routine in the 1942 theatrical short Mickey s Birthday Party

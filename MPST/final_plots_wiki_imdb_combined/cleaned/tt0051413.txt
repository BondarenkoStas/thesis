Following a routine nuclear experiment the ship Ryujin Maru II disappeared while in the South Pacific Days later another ship bound for Izu stumbles upon the craft adrift at sea
Six members of the crew decide to board the ship
To their surprise they find no one on board at all only clothes lying around but in a way that in dim light make them look like a person is in them
In the captain s room they find an unfinished log and begin to suspect that the crew must have been killed somehow
While leaving the captain s room Dai one of the crew members who boarded the ship is killed by a mysterious blue liquid that climbs up his leg and melts his body leaving only his clothes behind
After killing Dai the liquid takes the shape of a man and is joined by another one from the window
The monsters rush at one of the terrified men and quickly claim another victim
Next Sou is killed on the dock while trying to escape
Only two of the original six make it off the ship alive and they spot Liquid People walking around the deck as they disembark away from the ship
Much later in the outskirts of Tokyo a drug smuggler by the name of Misaki is mysteriously killed while trying to get away leaving only his clothes behind
The police investigate by going to his apartment only to find his girlfriend Arai Chikako who says he hasn t returned for five days
Arai works at the cabaret so the police decide to go there for further investigation
After her performance the police go back to Arai s room and find a man backstage with her
After finding a note to Arai in his pocket they bring him in as a suspect
He is identified as Masada an assistant professor at Jyoto University
Masada explains that he wanted to talk to Arai about Misaki and explains his theory that Misaki s disappearance is the result of his physical form melting away possibly from an extreme amount of radiation in the rain that night
The police don t buy a word and set up patrols at Misaki s apartment where Arai is living
That night a man by the name of Nishiyama sneaks into the apartment and threatens Arai asking her where Misaki is however he gets no answer as Arai explains that she simply doesn t know
After thinking it over Nishiyama states that he will spare her life for tonight and leaves by the window
Not long after Arai hears gun shots that are followed by a scream
Arai then opens the door to the apartment and faints in the hall
The police go the room to investigate and look out the window only to see clothes and a gun lying out on the street
In the morning the police take Arai in for questioning but get no new information from her
Masada arrives at the police station to try and prove his theory to them once more this time he invites them to go back to the hospital with him where he announces that he has collected witnesses that will prove his theory
Once there the witnesses tell their story of the six members of their ship that boarded the ship and how four of the men lost their lives that night
Masada next shows him the effect of the Ash of Death the type of nuclear explosion that the Ryujin Maru II was exposed to on a bullfrog
The bullfrog melts almost immediately all of its cells are transformed into a liquid
The police still don t buy that the Misaki disappearance is related to this though
The police decide to question Arai again this time showing her a group of pictures asking her to identify who came into the apartment the night before
She points out Nishiyama out of the pictures a member of the Hanada gang
Meanwhile Masada finds a lifesaver on the docks that belongs to the Ryujin Maru II and he starts to suspect that the liquid might have attached itself to it and traveled to Tokyo
Masada takes the lifesaver back to the University where he and his colleagues find out that the lifesaver is indeed radioactive
Arai then visits the institute to find Masada and tells him about the murders and how a liquid killed the victims
Professor Maki is intrigued by the girl s story and asks that Masada goes to the police station and tell them their findings
Masada complies but is still laughed at down at the station
The police become notably annoyed with his persistence in pursuing this theory
So to stay in their favor Masada divulges that he believes that a waiter at the cabaret may be in on the drug smuggling
That night the police visit the cabaret again disguised as customers
They watch and mark down which tables the waiter stops at for long periods of time
Every time someone from one of these marked tables starts to leave they arrest them as a suspect
Eventually the guests of the club begin to catch on and one of them fires his gun right before they cuff him
The waiter hears this and warns Uchida an intricate figure in the drug smuggling ring and they retreat to one of the dancer s rooms
Once inside they try to escape through the window but are cut off by an H Man
The waiter along with one of the dancers is killed
The H Man next tries to get Arai but is distracted by one of the policemen who starts firing at it
The H Man liquefies the officer and then escapes through the window
During the commotion Uchida takes off his clothes to fake his death and escapes
The police now accept Masada s theory about the Ash of Death
It s also confirmed that the liquid got to Tokyo by attaching itself to the lifesaver
Maki explains to the authorities that the only way to kill the creatures is by electrocution or incineration
Then Masada after studying Uchida s clothes explains to the police that they weren t radioactive meaning he must have escaped
Shortly after this discovery Arai is kidnapped by Uchida
Meanwhile the authorities plan to use their high voltage discharge unit to stop the H men s infiltration upstream
Next they plan to evacuate and fill the surrounding bodies of water with gasoline to incinerate the ones already in the city
Before the authorities can put this plan into operation Uchida leads Arai into the sewers to retrieve the stash of drugs that the waiter had been hiding down there
In the meantime Masada finds a piece of Arai s clothing floating in the water near one of the sewage valves and rushes in the sewers looking for her
The police catch wind of Masada s actions and ask permission to go down with one of the teams preparing the gasoline operation
A rescue team is then prepared and goes in after them
Uchida is killed shortly after by one of the liquid people and Arai begins to flee
Masada finds her and manages to help her get away as the rescue team discovers them both with the H men in hot pursuit
The water is then ignited burning alive all of the monsters and putting an end to their reign of terror
The movie began with a clip of the rising mushroom cloud the result of a nuclear test
Followed on from there a scene is shown of a drug dealing in progress during a rainy night in a city
Misaki came out of a sewer to meet an accomplice waiting inside a car
Misaki shot at something that was melting him away
At the police station witnesses including a police on a beat are giving statements to station officers who found the things being told a bit far fetched
Furthering the investigation into the drug dealings police detectives went to Misaki s apartment
They found his girlfriend Chikako Arai a cabaret singer brought her to the station for questioning
Later the detectives stake out the cabaret and arrested Masada a biologist and a university professor as a suspect because on him was found a note he wrote to Arai
When brought to the police station for questioning Detective Tominaga recognized Masada cleared him of being a suspect
Later on when Arai came back to Misaki s apartment she found the window wide open
She switched on the light and a man Nishiyama hiding behind the curtain grabs her and threatens her to tell him where is Misaki
He left the apartment through the window since Arai does not know Misaki s whereabout and police detectives are below
Gun shots and the scream of a man are heard
Arai covers her face in horror opens the door of the apartment straggles out and faints in the hall way
The police goes in the room to investigate looks out the window only to see clothes and a gun lying out in a puddle on the street
In the morning Arai is questioned at the police station about the incident the night before but gets no where
Just as the detectives are finishing their reports with their chief Detective Tominaga Masada arrives asks Tominaga whether he found Misaki
After some conversational exchanges Tominaga invites Masada to talk to Arai to see if he can get some info from her
As Masada was questioning Arai Tominaga pokes fun at Masada s theory of the missing Misaki and informed him that another person has disappeared the same way as Misaki
This brought Masada to ask Tominaga to follow him to the hospital where he introduces two witnesses to something that can support his theory
The witnesses tell their story of what happened when they and four other members of their ship boarded the drifting ship Ryujin Maru II and how four of those men lost their lives that night
Masada shows him the effect of the Ash of Death the type of nuclear explosion the Ryujin Maru II was exposed to on a bullfrog
The bullfrog melts almost immediately all of its cells are transformed into liquid
The police still don t buy that the Misaki disappearance is related to this
Masada shows a lifesaver from Ryujin Maru II found by some fishermen on the docks in Tokyo Bay to the detectives but they are not interested
Masada takes the lifesaver back to the University where he and his colleagues found out that the lifesaver is radioactive
Arai visits the institute to find Masada and tells him that she witnessed a person being dissolved meltdown
Professor Maki is intrigued by the girl s story
Masada under Professor Maki s instruction went to see Tominaga and told him what they found and that the public must be warned of the impending menace threatening them
The police still refuse to believe him
In the end Masada chides them for not having pity on Arai because she is being hounded by the police as well as the gangsters
He told them that if they trusted her and go to the cabaret she could point out to them the drug smuggling gang members at the cabaret of whom the waiter is the main person to watch as he is the connection
The police took up the suggestion went to cabaret under disguise
As each of the pointed out members leave they are arrested
The one of them fires his gun before he was handcuffed
The waiter heard it warns Uchida and they retreat to one of the dancer s rooms
They try to escape through the window but are cut off by an H Man
The waiter along with one of the dancers is killed
The H Man next tries to get Arai at the ladies but she escapes
The H Man tries again to get Arai but gets distracted by a detective shooting at it
It liquefies the detective and then escapes During the commotion Uchida takes off his clothes to fake his death and escapes
The police now accepts Masada s theory about the Ash of Death
It s also confirmed that the liquid got to Tokyo by attaching itself to the lifesaver
Maki explains to the authorities that the only way to kill the creatures is by electrocution or incineration
Then Masada after studying Uchida s clothes explains to the police that they weren t radioactive meaning he must have escaped
Shortly after this discovery Arai is kidnapped by Uchida

In the meantime Masada finds a piece of Arai s clothing floating in the water near one of the sewage outlet and rushes into the sewer looking for her
Tominaga catch wind of Masada s actions goes down to the sewer too with one of the teams preparing the gasoline operation
A rescue team is then prepared and goes in after them
Uchida is killed shortly after by one of the liquid people and Arai begins to flee
Masada finds her and manages to help her get away as the rescue team discovers them both with the H men in hot pursuit
The water is then ignited burning alive all of the monsters and putting an end to their reign of terror
The narrator made a final statement that with the continuing H bombing tests the next ruler of the Earth may be the H men

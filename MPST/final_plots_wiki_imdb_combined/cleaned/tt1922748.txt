The Investigator concerns a United States Senator who is never explicitly identified as Joseph McCarthy but who shares McCarthy s nasally whine and who uses such McCarthy esque sayings as Your uncooperative attitude can only cast the gravest doubts on your own loyalty
This senator dies in an airplane crash and finds himself at the gates of Heaven where a tribunal must decide whether he is worthy of heaven or hell
There he meets Cotton Mather of the Salem Witch Trials Tomas de Torquemada of the Spanish Inquisition and other famous inquisitors from history who despite their reputations as shrewd and conniving characters call themselves mere untutored novices compared to the Senator
As it turns out they ve been looking for someone to commandeer the tribunal and bring the latest inquisitorial techniques to it and they see that the Senator is the perfect man for the job
The Senator easily takes control of the committee and soon realizes that a great many individuals in heaven could potentially be subversives from down there
He soon calls numerous historical figures to the stand including Thomas Jefferson Socrates John Milton and Martin Luther
When they testify they all give oddly relevant quotations of theirs such as when Voltaire states that liberty of thought is the life of the soul
Completely disregarding their statements regarding freedom and rights the Senator sends them all to Hell claiming that security is the paramount issue
When trying to call Karl Marx to the stand the Senator accidentally calls other individuals named Karl Marx instead of the Karl Marx as a result the Senator orders that all those in Heaven with the name Karl Marx be banished to Hell
The Senator s actions soon create a panic of suspicion in Heaven where everyone is a potential subversive Beethoven Bach and Wagner agree to drop Chopin from their quartet because of suspicion derived from his Revolutionary Ã‰tude
Chopin s replacement a non controversial cipher named Otto Schmenk eventually replaces other famous subversives in literary and musical pursuits eventually joining them in banishment as well
Finally after sending dozens of subversives to hell the Senator has run out of ideas
Can t we jazz the hearing up with a few names
he asks an assistant I don t want them to think we re scraping the bottom of the barrel
Then Satan pays a call on the Senator demanding that his investigations cease because the influence of those he s sent to his domain are changing it too much Karl Marx for example is distributing pamphlets declaring Workers of the Underworld unite
You have nowhere to go but up
Satan claims the Senator is bungling his job insisting there are more subtle ways to handle his committee and the deportations
But the Senator has become a demagogue valuing his position above all else
Finally claiming that there is no one so high as to be immune from investigation he s found the name he s looking for God Himself whom the characters in the show refer to as The Chief
Even Mather and Torquemada try to discourage him now but the Senator refuses to listen
He soon rises to an insane scream crying I AM THE CHIEF
as God suddenly appears before him furiously banishing him to Hell
However the Senator is so vile and abhorrent that Satan will not even let him enter so he is returned to earth still stammering I am the chief I am the chief In a brief epilogue a doctor explains to one of the Senator s acquaintances Mr Garson that despite having lived through the plane crash it somehow affected his mind hence his strange mutterings and wonders if he ll ever regain his sanity
Mr Garson declares at the doctor s disbelief of the Senator emerging virtually unscathed after being found at the foot of the mountain where the plane crashed It was an act of God

It is evening
Lightning thunder gale force winds
On a stormy evening the people of Cyprus anxiously await the arrival of the new governor Otello from a naval battle with the Turks
For a moment it seems as if Otello s ship will founder to the delight of Otello s treacherous ensign Iago but Otello arrives safely and announces that the Turkish fleet has been destroyed and the Cypriots cheer
Iago offers to help the young Venetian gentleman Roderigo in his seduction of Otello s wife Desdemona Iago envies Otello his success and longs to destroy the Moor
Among his grievances Iago is outraged that Otello has appointed Cassio to be the captain of the navy a position that Iago hoped to have
The people of Cyprus celebrate the safe return of Otello and his men by lighting a bonfire and drinking

Cassio and Montano begin to duel and Iago sends Roderigo to call the alarm
Montano is wounded and the fight is stopped only by the appearance of Otello
Otello orders Montano and Cassio to lower their swords

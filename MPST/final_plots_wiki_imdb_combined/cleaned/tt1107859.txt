A Memphis police detective Jacob King deals with the traumatic childhood memory of his brother s murder by devoting his life to hunting down serial killers
The story opens with King capturing and throwing from a fifth story window Billy Joel Hill a madman who had used timed explosive devices implanted in his victim s bodies
King and his partner Detective Storm Anderson then begin investigating another local serial killer Lazereus known by the press as The Grifter a pervert with delusions of grandeur who murders prostitutes and leaves cryptographic clues involving zodiac signs on and in their bodies
During the investigation King and Storm get help from a sympathetic coroner and fend off interference from a by the book FBI agent Frankie Miller
Miller is alarmed by King s ultra violent police tactics and suspects the detective may be mentally unbalanced and more involved in the murders than anyone knows
King solves the Lazereus murders by researching cryptography and brutally beating information out of Memphis lowest lowlifes but has trouble actually nailing the elusive Lazereus
During a struggle Lazereus scratches King and then places what he scratches off under the fingernail of his latest victim in an effort to frame King for the murders
In the meantime Billy Joel Hill is released on bail and continues his rampage eventually kidnaping and murdering King s police officer girlfriend Celine throwing further suspicion on King
King finds and kills Hill in a brutal confrontation and is cleared of the murder suspicions by the written confession of the captured Lazereus
When Storm and Miller find HIll they also find that King has disappeared leaving a note for Storm thanking him for his friendship and telling him that he will not be seeing King again
The final scene shows King arriving at a house that looks exactly like the one we were shown in his childhood flashbacks
There King is greeted by people who appear to be his wife and children all of whom speak to him in Russian
They greet him enthusiastically as though he was returning from a long trip
The woman who seems to be King s wife leads him to the bedroom and seductively strips for him
King smiles and looks happy to be home

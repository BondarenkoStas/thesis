Sailor Guardian Usagi and Chibiusa overhear two girls talking about the Sailor Guardians after they see a poster
As the girls debate over the smartest most elegant strongest and the leader of the Sailor Guardians Usagi grandly claims those titles for herself
Chibiusa shakes her head at Usagi s delusion
Clips appear from the debut of each Sailor Guardian and that girl s image song plays in the background
When even Tuxedo Mask has been mentioned and the girls are about to leave Usagi butts in on their conversation and asks them directly about Sailor Moon
The girls give a series of glowing compliments about Sailor Moon but unlike their analysis of the other Sailor Guardians they also list her faults
After the girls leave Usagi sarcastically apologizes for being a clumsy cry baby and then bursts into exaggerated tears
Promise of the Rose A young Mamoru Chiba hands a mysterious boy a rose before he disappears vowing to bring Mamoru a flower
In the present Mamoru meets up with Usagi Tsukino and the Sailor Guardians at the Jindai Botanical Garden
Usagi attempts to kiss Mamoru but when he suspects the other girls of spying on him he walks off outside alone
The stranger appears from the garden s fountain and takes Mamoru s hands into his own which makes Usagi uncomfortable
Usagi tries to break the man s grasp from Mamoru but is knocked down
The man vows that no one will prevent him from keeping his promise before disappearing again
Mamoru tells Usagi that the stranger s name is Fiore
At Rei Hino s temple the Sailor Guardians discuss an asteroid which has started to approach Earth and on which Luna and Artemis have discovered traces of vegetal life
The talk turns into rumors about Mamoru s and Fiore s possible relationship while Usagi thinks about how Mamoru had told her that he had no family and was alone and how she had promised him she would be his family from now on
Fiore sends his flower monster henchwoman Glycina to Tokyo to drain the population s life energy but the Sailor Guardians free them and destroy the monster
Fiore appears revealing his responsibility for the attack and uses a flower called a Xenian before severely injuring the Sailor Guardians
Mamoru attempts to talk Fiore out of fighting but the Xenian controls Fiore s mind
After Mamoru saves Usagi from certain death by intercepting his attack Fiore takes Mamoru to an asteroid rapidly approaching Earth and begins to revive him in a crystal filled with liquid
While in the crystal Mamoru remembers meeting Fiore after his parents died in a car accident
Mamoru had previously assumed that he had made up the boy as an imaginary friend
Fiore explains that he had to leave Mamoru because of the Earth s unsuitable atmosphere Mamoru gave Fiore a rose before disappearing
Fiore searched the galaxy to find a flower for Mamoru finding the Xenian in the process
Seeking revenge on the humans for his loneliness Fiore returns to Earth
Meanwhile Luna and Artemis tell the Sailor Guardians that the Xenian can destroy planets using weak hearted people
Ami Mizuno realizes that the energy from the asteroid matches the flower monster s evil energy deducing that Fiore has hidden there
The Sailor Guardians decide to rescue Mamoru
Despite her initial reluctance the Sailors and Chibiusa convince Usagi to save Mamoru and confront Fiore
After the Sailor Guardians fly to the asteroid Fiore reveals his plans to scatter flower seeds to drain humanity s energy on Earth
The Sailors Guardians then fight hundreds of flower monsters but they end up captured
When Fiore orders Usagi to surrender she is unable to feel his loneliness Fiore begins to drain her life force
Mamoru escapes and saves Sailor Moon by throwing a rose at Fiore
The rose embedded in Fiore s chest blossoms freeing him from the Xenian s control
The flowers on the asteroid disappear but it continues to hurtle towards Earth
Usagi uses the Silver Crystal to transform into Princess Serenity to change the course of the asteroid
In an attempt to stop Usagi Fiore soon realizes that when Usagi and Mamoru were children she gave Mamoru the rose that was once given to him after Fiore had left
With Fiore and the Xenian destroyed by the Silver Crystal Usagi Mamoru and the Sailor Guardians combine their powers to divert the asteroid away from the Earth
The Silver Crystal is shattered and Usagi dies of exhaustion
Back on Earth despite Luna and Artemis concern over why the Sailor Guardians are taking too long Chibiusa assures them that the girls are all right
In the aftermath the Guardians and Mamoru are devastated by Usagi s death but Fiore reappears and thanks Mamoru
Using a nectar filled flower with Fiore s life energy Mamoru wets his lips with the nectar and kisses Usagi reviving her and repowering the Silver Crystal
Fiore reduced to the form of a child again returns to space to live in peace

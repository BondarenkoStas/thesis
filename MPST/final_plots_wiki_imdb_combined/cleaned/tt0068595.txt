Distinguished Professor Gordon explains that Earth is being tormented by periodic sex rays which send people into a sexual frenzy
When one of the rays hits the Ford Tri Motor passenger aircraft carrying Flesh Gordon and Dale Ardor the pilots abandon the controls and everyone aboard has manic sex
When they finish Flesh and Dale escape the imminent crash by parachute
They land near the workshop of Flexi Jerkoff who has a plan to stop the sex rays at their source
They then travel to the planet Porno in Jerkoff s phallic rocket ship and are briefly hit by a sex ray resulting in a frantic three way orgy
They crash land after being shot by the minions of Emperor Wang and are attacked by several one eyed Penisauruses before being taken prisoner by Wang s soldiers
They are brought before Wang who is presiding over an orgy of more than a dozen men and women
Jerkoff is sent to work in Wang s laboratory while Wang announces his intention to marry Dale and Flesh is sentenced to death but is saved when Queen Amora takes him to be her sex slave
Wang shoots down Amora s ship and Flesh is the only survivor
He is reunited with Jerkoff and they resume their efforts to defeat Wang now with Amora s Power Pasties
Wang and Dale s wedding is interrupted when Dale is kidnapped by Amazonian lesbians whose leader Chief Nellie attempts to initiate Dale into their cult
Flesh and Jerkoff save her unexpectedly aided by Prince Precious of the Forest Kingdom
With help from their new ally Jerkoff builds a weapon to destroy the sex ray
They confront Wang and trick his rapist robots into turning on him but Wang escapes seeking the aid of the towering idol of the Great God Porno
Porno comes to life and captures Dale as they flee blandly commenting on his actions
Jerkoff shoots the living idol freeing Dale and causing the god to fall on Wang and the sex ray
Flesh Dale and Jerkoff are celebrated as heroes and return to Earth

Holmes is visited by Mr Chalmers an insurance agent with a strange tale
Seven single men calling themselves The Good Comrades live together in the remote Scottish castle of Drearcliffe House near the village of Inverneill
Recently one of the Good Comrades received a strange message an envelope containing nothing but seven orange pips
That night he was murdered and his body horribly mutilated
A few days later a second envelope was delivered this time containing six pips and the recipient also died mysteriously soon afterwards his battered corpse being recovered from the base of the cliffs
Chalmers holds 100 000 of life insurance policies on the seven men and suspects that one is systematically murdering the others in order to collect the money and begs Holmes to investigate
Holmes and Watson arrive at the scene only to find another murder has occurred
His body is burned to a crisp
Lestrade also arrives to investigate
Despite Holmes best efforts three more deaths occur each time leaving the victim s body unrecognisable
Lestrade jumps to the obvious conclusion that the last surviving member Bruce Alistair murdered all the others
However after Watson goes missing Holmes has deduced the truth and leads Lestrade to a secret room where all the Good Comrades alive and well are hiding with Watson tied up
Holmes explains that Alistair was the victim of a plot to frame him for murder and collect the insurance money by the other six

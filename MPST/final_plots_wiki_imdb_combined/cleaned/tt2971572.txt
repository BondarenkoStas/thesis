Five years later The Boss has been elected President of the United States with the other members of the Saints Keith David and former Vice Kings leader Benjamin King acting as cabinet
While preparing for a press conference the Boss is told that Asha and Matt have arrived at the White House to warn them of what they suspect is an impending alien invasion
Just as the Boss is informed the invasion begins spearheaded by the alien warlord Zinyak who captures the entire cabinet including the Boss
The Boss wakes up in a 1950s sitcom set in the city of Steelport devoid of violence and foul language
The Saints computer hacking specialist Kinzie Kensington contacts the Boss and informs them that they are trapped inside a simulation with each of the Zin s prisoners trapped inside personal simulations of their own fears in order to break their will
With Kinzie s help the Boss breaks free of the simulation and joins Kinzie and Keith in a stolen Zin ship
While the trio attempt to contact reinforcements from Earth Zinyak atomizes the planet killing everyone not already captured by the Zin
Enraged the Boss returns to the Steelport simulation to find their friends and reach Zinyak
After rescuing another prisoner of Zinyak an artificial intelligence later named CID and providing him with a physical body the Boss with his help goes into the other Saint s simulations and rescues them from their nightmares
As the simulation begins to weaken under the Saints influence Zinyak floods virtual Steelport with copies of gang members the Boss has faced in the past
Kinzie determines that the copies are being made from someone s memory leading the Boss to conclude Johnny Gat who was seemingly killed during the events of Saints Row The Third is still alive and trapped within the simulation
Despite protests from Kinzie and Matt that rescuing Johnny will reveal their location to Zinyak the Boss rescues Johnny from his nightmare of Aisha s death and gets him back to the ship
Johnny explains that during the fight in which he was presumed killed he was actually abducted by Zinyak years in advance of their invasion as Zinyak had concluded that Johnny could have single handedly stopped him if left on Earth
The Saints rally inside the simulation in order to confront Zinyak but are ambushed by an enormous Zin force
They escape but Kinzie is captured by Zinyak and the Boss emerges from the simulation to find that Keith betrayed the Saints and fled
Returning to Steelport the Boss finds Keith has been declared president of the simulation
When confronted Keith claims that Zinyak has the means to restore Earth and has agreed to do so in exchange for the Boss life
However Keith is ultimately unable to bring himself to kill the Boss and rejoins the Saints
The Boss determined to find Kinzie pursues Keith into his nightmare and with help from Roddy Piper beats Keith up until he barely manages to tell them where Kinzie has been taken to
After the Boss rescues Kinzie from her nightmare she devises a plan to crash the simulation which will force the Zin to draw power from their ship to keep it running thus weakening the ship itself and creating an opening for the Saints to enter
Working together the remaining Saints manage to overload the simulation shutting it down just as the Boss escapes
Assaulting Zinyak s ship the Boss finds power armor emulating the powers they had in the simulation and confronts Zinyak in his throne room
While the entire Zin Empire watches Zinyak and the Boss battle each other
With help from the Saints the Boss kills Zinyak by tearing his head off and emerges victorious
Impressed the Zin forces surrender to the Boss who becomes the new head of the Zin Empire

After being pursued by Agents Ghost and Niobe escape from the Matrix with the package which turns out to be a message to the human city Zion warning them that the machines are approaching with an army of Sentinels
Niobe and Ghost are tasked with calling the rest of the ships back to Zion to coordinate a defense
With this in mind the captains of the various ships hold a meeting in the Matrix to decide on how best to defend themselves
During the meeting Agents attack the building they are in although Niobe and Ghost are able to help their allies escape

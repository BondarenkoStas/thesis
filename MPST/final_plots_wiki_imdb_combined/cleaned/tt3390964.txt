Several months after the events of No Time Left Clementine is travelling with Omid and a visibly pregnant Christa after it s assumed that they reunited outside of Savannah
Stopping at a public restroom next to Gil s Pitstop the trio discuss the name of Christa s unborn child before deciding to clean up
After heading into the female restroom Clementine puts her gun down and begins to clean herself up but accidentally drops her bottle of water and heads into a stall to retrieve it
After retrieving it she hears someone coming in
Having left her gun by the sink Clementine stays in the stall as the stranger Michelle retrieves the weapon
However Clementine accidentally makes a noise causing Michelle to coax her out at gunpoint and demand that Clementine hands over her possessions
Suddenly Omid enters the room and realizes what is going on
He takes a stealthy approach and sneaks toward Michelle but the door closes loudly causing Michelle to reactively turn and shoot killing Omid
Christa suddenly runs in while Michelle immediately drops the gun and apologizes
Christa ultimately kills her with a shot to the abdomen before cradling Omid s body The scene then cuts to sixteen months later where Clementine and Christa are seen sitting around a campfire in an attempt at cooking a weasel they caught and killed earlier on evidently in a solemn mood with plans to head towards Wellington where Christa believes it may be safer
Soon Christa heads off to look for more firewood whilst Clementine s left to tend the fire
Searching through her backpack she finds the other half of the Everett Family photo of Lee that he had torn off in A New Day and looks upon it sadly before finding her old drawing of Kenny Katjaa and Duck and again looking upon it with a solemn attitude before eventually finding a lighter which she uses to tend to the fire
After fuelling it with a nearby log Clementine hears a noise not far from the camp and finds Christa being held at gunpoint by two bandits who demand to know whether or not there is anyone with her
Given the option of either sneaking away or throwing a rock at Winston in order to distract them Winston chases after Clementine and attempts to restrain her though she s able to break free by pushing Winston into the reach of a nearby walker which then grabs and eventually kills him while Clementine is approached by several other walkers which emerge from the woods
Backing away in fear Clementine falls into a nearby river and is taken downstream by the current until she passes out The next day she wakes up on the banks of the river and after a brief trek through the woods she encounters a dog named Sam alongside an abandoned campsite which presumably had once belonged to Sam s owners
After a brief search around the area Sam begins to bark at a walker tied to a tree with a knife sticking out of its arm
After Clementine remembers some words Lee told her before his demise she beats it with a large branch and retrieves the knife which is still sharp
There s also a trash can and after searching it Clementine finds a can of beans
After using the knife to pry open the can Sam will begin to beg
After a choice to feed him or not Sam will attack Clementine biting her on the arm
After grabbing her knife a rock or nothing Clementine stabs punches and or beats Sam multiple times until she successfully kicks him where he is pierced by a metal frame in his torso and hind leg
Clementine has the choice of killing him or leaving him to die Clementine eventually heads off with a severely wounded arm and eventually ends up almost passing out from exhaustion in the woods only to realize that she s surrounded by several walkers
Attempting to flee she s almost overwhelmed by a walker only to be saved by Luke and Pete who begin to carry her off
Suddenly noticing the wound on Clementine s arm however Luke initially assumes it to be a walker bite and begins to discuss with Pete over what to do only for Clementine to tell them that it was a dog bite
Still skeptical Luke and Pete continue arguing if they should leave her here or not to
Pete eventually decides to give her the benefit of the doubt and take her to their cabin where she can be seen to by their doctor
Again exhausted and wounded Clementine passes out and eventually stirs from consciousness only to wake up as several other people argue over what to do with her
Noticing someone with an uncanny resemblance to Kenny Clementine is initially surprised and causes the individual revealed to be Nick to become startled and accidentally fire off their gun close to Clementine s proximity
After further arguing between the group and herself over the origin of her wound Clementine is examined by Carlos who s still unable to determine whether or not she was bitten by a walker Ultimately the group decides to temporarily hold Clementine in the shed until the following day so they can see whether or not she will develop the fever usually associated with infection despite Clementine s requests for her wound to be treated before it worsens
Deciding to find the supplies to treat herself Clementine uses a hammer to break away a board blocking off a hole that leads outside of the shed
Clementine has a choice to either sneak into the cabin through a gap beneath the patio and making her way inside via a trap door or tap on a window catching Alvin s attention
She can then persuade Alvin to give her some supplies as well as a juice box
Once inside you can eavesdrop on the group s meeting she finds them still unable to decide over what to do with her and heads upstairs to acquire the necessary resources from the various rooms including a roll of rags from the main bedroom to serve as a makeshift bandage
Whilst in the bathroom she s able to acquire a needle but is forced to hide after hearing someone approaching and notices Rebecca in a visibly distressed state worriedly talking to herself about the identity of her baby before leaving
Clementine then heads into the other bedroom only to notice that Sarah is inside and has discovered her
Despite this she willingly offers her help to Clementine and displays a friendly interest in her curious as to whether or not she s her friend
Regardless she offers a bottle of peroxide normally used by her dad to treat her when she s cut to Clementine and asks that she doesn t tell anyone that she helped her Heading back to the shed Clementine painfully disinfects her wound with the peroxide before using the needle and some fishing wire to suture her wound shut only to accidentally drop the roll of rags near the hole in the wall
Reaching down to grab it she s suddenly attacked by a walker which had been attracted by her cries of pain and grabs her by the foot breaking its way through the hole in the process
Climbing atop her the walker attempts to bite Clementine in a similar manner that Sandra had attempted to bite Lee in A New Day but is knocked back after Clementine hits it with a brick before she s able to use a rake to push it back and impale it onto a nearby anchor
Before it is able to pull itself free Clementine quickly grabs the hammer and begins to bludgeon the walker over the head with it again shadowing Lee s killing of Sandra in the previous season just as the others burst into the shed after hearing the noise After briefly arguing amongst themselves Clementine s allowed into the cabin with them where her wound s examined and bandaged by Carlos
Carlos then says Clementine should stay away from his daughter Sarah
Clementine can either say sorry making Carlos say she s forgiven or say something else making Carlos say the opposite
Luke then comes in immediatly after Carlos leaves with some food who appears to have changed his previously skeptical attitude towards her
The two make conversation where Clementine s given the opportunity to confide in him about her past and mention Lee including the lessons he passed onto her
Nick soon enters the room to apologise to Clementine for his earlier outburst against her and if prompted it s revealed by Luke that Nick s mother had been previously killed by a bite victim they had allowed into the group
Nick then leaves while Pete comes in and says something about the place being lit in the middle of the woods making Luke saying it s time to turn in anyways
Pete also says they re going out to fish in the morning
Rebecca also turns up and warns that Clementine shouldn t get too comfortable around the group The following day Clementine and Pete are seen out in the woods on a fishing trip where Pete talks about Nick s childhood
Nick soon catches up with them and displays annoyance at one particular story being told though Clementine can attempt to defuse the situation
Arriving at the river they are met with the sight of several fresh corpses scattered across the banks and Pete briefly mentions that an individual referred as Carver may have been responsible for it and decides to investigate the scene for any clues as to who is responsible for it
Whilst searching Clementine discovers her backpack next to one of the bodies and suddenly realizes that the body s still alive and belongs to one of the bandits who had previously attacked her and Christa
Injured and weak the bandit asks for water and Clementine is given the option of refusing or granting his request but before she can question him further a number of walkers begin to emerge from the woods on either side Pete s attacked and bitten on the leg though he claims that he had merely lost his footing whilst at the same time a number of walkers attack Nick
Clementine s forced between saving either of the two if she saves Pete Nick will eventually fight off the walkers but will be seen fleeing into the woods whilst if she saves Nick then Pete will ultimately be killed by the walkers
The episode then ends with Clementine and her companion quickly fleeing into the woods

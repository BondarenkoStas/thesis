Two film academy students Ali and Sameer must make a movie in order to graduate
They choose to create a documentary illustrating reasons not to join the Indian Armed Forces and go on a motorcycle road trip bearing three letters they have been given to deliver each from a slain soldier to his family
On their first stop in Atari Amritsar they meet the widow Kuljeet Kaur and the son Jassi of a Sikh soldier Balkar Singh who was Killed in action three years earlier
The students find that the entire village is very proud of the heroic officer and his sacrifice for the country
When they are flying kites their kite is cut and it falls beyond a certain fence in another field
Jassi tells them that the area beyond the fence is Pakistan and the fence is the Border
The students second stop Himachal finds them meeting the wheelchair bound former Air Force pilot Vikram Shergill whose Army officer brother Dhananjay Shergill had also been Killed in Action
There they see that Vikram is very proud of his brother s sacrifice for his country
He shows them how he has come to terms with his own grief
The third letter is to be delivered to a certain Mr and Mrs Naqvi
In between their bike runs out of petrol and they hitch a ride on a military convoy heading to a nearby base
They witness coffins of martyrs in their truck and the driver quotes an inspiring poem
At the base they talk to the Regiment commander and find another letter by Lt Sahil Naqvi which they request to deliver it themselves
They see that Mrs Naqvi is busy in a tea party hardly paying any attention
Sameer accuses her of not loving her son and says that Sahil was a coward
Mrs Naqvi plays them a tape which Sahil had recorded in war after he had saved a junior s life
She tells him that she and her husband have been affected and the Tea Parties serve as a distraction for them
They leave but return the next day and slowly bring the couple s life back to normal
After completing their film they reveal in a voice over that they graduated but did not go to America because the trip has changed their outlook
They try to join the Army but fail
Hence they start a school to share their experience
Some years later Sameer and Ali are waking around their School campus
A man in olive green uniform approaches them
This is revealed to be Jassi the son of the first martyred army officer
Now a strapping young man he has joined the army like his father and will soon graduate from the IMA
The movie ends with the statement You don t have to be a soldier to love your country

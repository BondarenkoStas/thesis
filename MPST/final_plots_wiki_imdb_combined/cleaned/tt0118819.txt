The Franco regime has declared a state of emergency curtailing civil liberties
A young prostitute Isabel Plaza Caballero gives birth on a bus to a son she names Víctor
Twenty years later Víctor Plaza shows up for a date with Elena a junkie with whom he had sex a week earlier
Elena is waiting for her drug dealer to arrive and orders Víctor to leave eventually threatening him with a gun
Enraged Víctor wrestles the gun from her in the process Elena gets knocked out and the gun goes off
A neighbour hears the shot and calls the police
Two cops respond to the report
The older cop Sancho is an unstable alcoholic who suspects his wife Clara of infidelity
The younger cop David more clean cut and sober
Through the window they catch sight of Víctor physically struggling with Elena
Sancho is ready to storm the apartment while David wants to call for a back up
When they enter Víctor holds Elena hostage at gunpoint
David tries to calm him down and get him to drop his gun but Sancho sabotages his efforts by repeatedly threatening Víctor
Finally David puts his gun to Sancho s head and gets first Sancho and then Víctor to put down their guns
David orders Elena to flee
Sancho then lunges for Víctor and as they wrestle for the gun it fires
Two years later Víctor in jail watches a wheelchair basketball match
David now partially paralyzed from the gunshot two years earlier is a star player in the 1992 Summer Paralympics
Elena now his wife cheers him on from the sidelines
Víctor has made good use of his time in jail taking a correspondence course in education working out and enriching his mind with a variety of subjects including the Bible
Four years later he is released
His mother has died leaving him some money and a house in am area scheduled for demolition
Víctor visits his mother s grave where he encounters Elena at her father s burial service
Without identifying himself he briefly offers her his condolences
Before leaving the cemetery he encounters Sancho s wife Clara who has arrived too late for Elena s service
They leave together and she visits his apartment
They establish a tentative relationship
Elena now off drugs and operating an orphanage tells David of her encounter with Víctor
David stops by Víctor s house and warns him not to go near his wife
Víctor challenges him to prevent him from doing whatever he wants but David punches him below the belt
David leaves but he sees Clara arriving and watches from a distance
Clara drawn by Víctor s enthusiasm and good looks agrees to teach him how to make love while pampering him with gifts and affection
She eventually falls in love with him
Víctor is accepted as a volunteer by the orphanage which accepts the qualifications he earned in prison and discovers he is very good with the children
Elena objects but can offer no compelling argument against Víctor
David continues to trail Víctor and discovers that he works at his wife s orphanage
He confronts Víctor again and Víctor denies responsibility for firing the shot that put him in a wheelchair
He demonstrates how Sancho made him squeeze the trigger because Sancho knew David was having an affair with Clara
Afterwards David tells his wife what Víctor said admitting that he was having an affair with Clara
Elena is disgusted but still plans to leave the orphanage to get away from Víctor
Víctor tells Elena that his original plan of revenge was to become the world s greatest lover make love to Elena all night long and then abandon her but that he now loves her too much to do so
Víctor tells Clara that they should stop meeting and they break up
While Víctor is working overnight at the orphanage Elena arrives to remove her belongings and offers Víctor a night of passion on condition he never contacts her again
Elena then tells David about this night of infidelity
She tells him she will remain his wife because he needs her more than Víctor does
David is nevertheless intent on avenging himself against Víctor
Clara unable to bear Sancho s abuse any longer leaves him in a violence scene leaving him bloodied
David arrives and helps Sancho clean his wounds before showing Sancho photographs he has been taking of Víctor and Clara
Sancho and David drive to Víctor s house arriving just as Clara has finished writing Víctor a farewell letter
Sancho and Clara hold each other at gunpoint and fire
Clara falls dead and Sancho is wounded
Sancho finally kills himself
At the end David narrates a letter written to his wife from Miami where he is spending Christmas with some friends apologizing for the way everything turned out
At the orphanage a pregnant Elena goes into labor and on the way to the hospital she and Víctor get stuck in heavy traffic
Víctor is reminded of the circumstances of his own birth and tells his unborn child that the Spanish people no longer live in fear as they did at the time of his birth

The focus for Brooklyn South was the 74th Precinct in southern Brooklyn New York City
Francis Frank Donovan was the patrol sergeant who presided every day over the morning shift assignments he gave to the uniformed officers
Donovan was an informant for the hated Internal Affairs Bureau and secretly reported to Lt Stan Jonas who early in the series transferred from being an IAB officer to the precinct captain after the officious Captain Lou Zerola transferred to precinct maintenance

In the pilot episode a psychotic gunman went on a shooting rampage outside the police station killing a number of policemen and innocent bystanders
He was wounded in the shootout and brought back into the station where he died from his gunshot wounds
It was later revealed that Ann Marie Kersey a policewoman whose boyfriend was one of the victims of the shooting spree slipped into the room where the wounded madman was being held and kicked him several times in his chest which caused his death
Because the shooter was black and all of his victims were white the killer s family pressured the city to launch an Internal Affairs investigation
Eventually everyone was exonerated for the suspect s death and Kersey completely got away with it though her guilt over murdering a critically wounded criminal would haunt her off and on for the duration of the series
Kersey then had a romantic affair with Donovan but it did not last
Kersey and Donovan later got back together
Later in the series Kersey was designated to detective

Terry helped foil the Irish gang s robbery and he ended up joining the police vice squad anti crime unit
Jack Lowery was a tough street cop coping with personal demons which included his selfish and nagging wife Yvonne who died early in the season
Lowery later started an affair with his female partner Nona Valentine which did not sit well with Clement Johnson Nona s former boyfriend and the station s traffic cop
Eventually Nona and Clem got back together then broke up and by the series end Nona got back together again with Lowery
Hector Villaneuva was a young rookie cop who was tutored by the rest of the officers how to do his job the best be could

Ray MacElwaine was a 50 year old veteran police officer who transferred to the 74th Precinct late in the series and soon proved himself to everyone that despite his age he could still walk the beat and take down criminals
MacElwaine also stuck up for Donovan after finding out Donovan s work with IAB
In the series final episode MacElwaine decided to retire from the police force and Santoro was promoted to Lieutenant

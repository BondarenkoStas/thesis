The show often combined humor and drama in the same episode
In the pilot episode of the series only the back and hand of law partner Chaney gripping the pages of a tax manual while seated at his desk are seen after he succumbed to a fatal heart attack
One of Chaney s final acts was to hire a new secretary who began work on the morning Chaney s body is discovered
Later in that episode in front of his partners friends and his wife the secretary at Chaney s eulogy reveals that she is transsexual and details how she first met the gay Chaney at a gay bar
Chaney had been financially supporting her gender transition and hired her as part of her real life test
She is then promptly fired from her job by Douglas Brackman in an act of transphobia
A running gag throughout the series was the overtly promiscuous lifestyle of divorce lawyer Arnie Becker and his chronic and constant liaisons with women up to and including bedding some of his own clients
This once caused problems when a client used him to set up her husband to be murdered
Series producer Steven Bochco used a similar incident in Hill Street Blues when a woman bedded one of the police officers in the squad and tricked him into shooting her ex husband when he broke into her house
A running gag during Harry Hamlin s tenure was to have his character Michael Kuzak always shown picking scrutinizing and eating pastries or fruit at the morning staff meetings
He was the only one who ate from the mountains of food provided
To some extent the sexual peccadilloes of almost the entire cast would become fodder for episodes of the series
After Grace van Owen makes a comment that Michael Kuzak would have to be a monkey before she d be interested in him he woos her on the courthouse steps in a gorilla suit
Douglas Brackman becomes involved with a sex therapist
Benny Stulwicz an intellectually disabled clerk at the office has sex with the intellectually disabled daughter of a client of the firm
Leland McKenzie and Rosalind Shays antagonists secretly become lovers
The show tied itself into the events of the Los Angeles riots of 1992 which were prompted by the acquittal of four white police officers who were put on trial for the videotaped beating of African American motorist Rodney King
In a scene reminiscent of the Reginald Denny incident tax attorney Stuart Markowitz is struck on the head by a rioter and ends up having serious head injuries causing a number of problems for him and his wife for several episodes as a result
Douglas Brackman their boss is also arrested in the mayhem of the riots as he is on his way to get remarried
In one scene later in the series the writers enacted an inside joke The easiest way to get rid of a soap opera character is to just have them fall down an elevator shaft
In her final scene the character of Rosalind Shays steps into the empty shaft and falls to her death
The show did not shy away from controversy with a scene in the episode He s a Crowd where one of the female lawyers Abby Perkins has an on screen romantic kiss with C J
Lamb another female lawyer who is openly bisexual
The name Chaney remains in the name of the law firm despite numerous changes in personnel and the death of Chaney in episode 1
When Michael Kuzak leaves it is announced that new stationery will arrive without Kuzak s name on the letterhead
In a line heard off screen and in the background Arnold Becker states I think we should drop Chaney s name

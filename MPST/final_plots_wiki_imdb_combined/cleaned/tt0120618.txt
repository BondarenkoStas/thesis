Kilgore Trout is a widely published but otherwise unsung and virtually invisible writer who is invited to deliver a keynote address at a local arts festival in distant Midland City
Dwayne Hoover is a wealthy businessman who owns much of Midland City but has become increasingly unstable mentally
The novel is achronological and frequently shifts focus between Hoover and Trout as well as supporting characters like Hoover s son Bunny and Wayne Hoobler and Kurt Vonnegut himself who appears as the author of the book
The novel s structure is a simple one yet it employs simultaneously evolving plots from different times and spaces
Early on Vonnegut as narrator creator says he s going to purge himself of mental clutter and throughout the novel can be found examining and refuting disparate concepts from the discovery of the new world in 1492 to euphemisms for genitalia
When Kilgore finally arrives in Midland City he piques the interest of Dwayne
A confused Dwayne demands a message from Kilgore who hands over a copy of his novel
Dwayne reads the novel which purports to be a message from the Creator of the Universe explaining that the reader in this case Dwayne is the only individual in the universe with free will
Everyone else is a robot
Dwayne believes the novel to be factual and immediately goes on a violent rampage severely beating his son his lover and nine other people before being taken into custody
While Kilgore is walking the streets of Midland after Dwayne s rampage the narrator of the book approaches Kilgore
The narrator tells Kilgore of his existence and lets Kilgore be free and under his own will
Kilgore begs to be made young again and the novel ends with a full page drawing of Vonnegut crying

Bernard lives happily with his wife Arlette and young son in a village outside Grenoble
One day a married couple with a little boy Philippe and Mathilde move into the house next door
Bernard and Mathilde are shocked at meeting each other because years before when both single they had a stormy affair which ended painfully
At first Bernard avoids Mathilde until a chance meeting in a supermarket reawakens long buried passions and soon while openly good neighbours in secret they pursue an affair
Though both find the strain of living their normal family and working lives unbearable it is Bernard who cracks first
After publicly revealing his violent passion for Mathilde at a garden party he keeps away from her and the two households try to get on with their lives
But the rejected Mathilde then cracks and after publicly collapsing at the tennis club is hospitalised with depression
When she is released she finds that to get far away from Bernard her husband has moved them out of the village
One night Bernard is woken by a banging shutter on the empty house next door and gets up to investigate
In the house he spots Mathilde in the darkness
After they have made love on the bare floor taking a gun out of her handbag she shoots first him and then herself

After Shao Kahn s invasion of Earthrealm is halted by Raiden s forces of light Raiden blasts and sends Kahn through a portal
At exactly the same time on Earth Superman stops Darkseid s Apokoliptian invasion by blasting Darkseid with his heat vision as he enters a boom tube
These acts do not destroy either of them but merge them into Dark Kahn and causes the DC and Mortal Kombat universes to merge
As this happens the characters abilities fluctuate causing violent rage outbreaks that are actually the feelings of Dark Kahn being infused in the characters from afar
Because of this certain characters gain either strength or vulnerability
This allows for such things as the possibility of Superman being defeated due to his vulnerability to magic and giving the Joker the ability to fight skilled martial artists such as his nemesis Batman and Deathstroke
With each world thinking that the other is responsible for the merger they fight each other until only one fighter from each side remains Raiden and Superman
In the final battle the two fight while Dark Kahn feeds on their rage
Both realizing that the other is not working with Dark Kahn they overcome their rage for each other and defeat their fused enemy restoring the two worlds to their normal separation
While everyone else has been sent to their original universe Darkseid and Shao Kahn have been switched and are both rendered powerless
In the end they both face eternal imprisonment in the other s universe Darkseid is restrained in the Netherealm while Shao Kahn is trapped in the Phantom Zone

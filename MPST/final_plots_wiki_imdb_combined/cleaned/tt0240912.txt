Part 1 April 7 1928 The first section of the novel is narrated by Benjamin Benjy Compson a source of shame to the family due to his diminished mental capacity the only characters who show a genuine care for him are Caddy his older sister and Dilsey a matriarchal servant
His narrative voice is characterized predominantly by its nonlinearity spanning the period 1898 1928 Benjy s narrative is a series of non chronological events presented in a stream of consciousness
The presence of italics in Benjy s section is meant to indicate significant shifts in the narrative
Originally Faulkner meant to use different colored inks to signify chronological breaks
This nonlinearity makes the style of this section particularly challenging but Benjy s style develops a cadence that while not chronologically coherent provides unbiased insight into many characters true motivations
Moreover Benjy s caretaker changes to indicate the time period Luster in the present T P
in Benjy s teenage years and Versh during Benjy s infancy and childhood
In this section we see Benjy s three passions fire the golf course on land that used to belong to the Compson family and his sister Caddy
But by 1928 Caddy has been banished from the Compson home after her husband divorced her because her child was not his and the family has sold his favorite pasture to a local golf club in order to finance Quentin s Harvard education
In the opening scene Benjy accompanied by Luster a servant boy watches golfers on the nearby golf course as he waits to hear them call caddie the name of his favorite sibling
When one of them calls for his golf caddie Benjy s mind embarks on a whirlwind course of memories of his sister Caddy focusing on one critical scene
In 1898 when their grandmother died the four Compson children were forced to play outside during the funeral
In order to see what was going on inside Caddy climbed a tree in the yard and while looking inside her brothers Quentin Jason and Benjy looked up and noticed that her underwear was muddy
This is Benjy s first memory and he associates Caddy with trees throughout the rest of his arc often saying that she smells like trees
Other crucial memories in this section are Benjy s change of name in 1900 upon the discovery of his disability the marriage and divorce of Caddy and Benjy s castration resulting from an attack on a girl that is alluded to briefly within this chapter when a gate is left unlatched and Benjy is out unsupervised
Readers often report trouble understanding this portion of the novel due to its impressionistic language necessitated by Benjamin s mental abilities as well as its frequent shifts in time and setting
Part 2 June 2 1910 Quentin the most intelligent of the Compson children gives the novel s best example of Faulkner s narrative technique
We see him as a freshman at Harvard wandering the streets of Cambridge contemplating death and remembering his family s estrangement from his sister Caddy
Like the first section its narrative is not strictly linear though the two interweaving threads of Quentin at Harvard on the one hand and of his memories on the other are clearly discernible
Quentin s main obsession is Caddy s virginity and purity
He is obsessed with Southern ideals of chivalry and is strongly protective of women especially his sister
When Caddy engages in sexual promiscuity Quentin is horrified
He turns to his father for help and counsel but the pragmatic Mr Compson tells him that virginity is invented by men and should not be taken seriously
He also tells Quentin that time will heal all
Quentin spends much of his time trying to prove his father wrong but is unable to do so
Shortly before Quentin leaves for Harvard in the fall of 1909 Caddy becomes pregnant by a lover she is unable to identify perhaps Dalton Ames whom Quentin confronts
The two fight with Quentin losing disgracefully and Caddy vowing for Quentin s sake never to speak to Dalton again
Quentin tells his father that they have committed incest but his father knows that he is lying and he did you try to make her do it and i i was afraid to i was afraid she might and then it wouldn t do any good
Quentin s idea of incest is shaped by the idea that if they could just have done something so dreadful that they would have fled hell except us he could protect his sister by joining her in whatever punishment she might have to endure
In his mind he feels a need to take responsibility for Caddy s sin
Pregnant and alone Caddy then marries Herbert Head whom Quentin finds repulsive but Caddy is resolute she must marry before the birth of her child
Herbert finds out that the child is not his and sends mother and daughter away in shame
Quentin s wanderings through Harvard as he cuts classes follow the pattern of his heartbreak over losing Caddy
For instance he meets a small Italian immigrant girl who speaks no English
Significantly he calls her sister and spends much of the day trying to communicate with her and to care for her by finding her home to no avail
He thinks sadly of the downfall and squalor of the South after the American Civil War
Tormented by his conflicting thoughts and emotions Quentin commits suicide by drowning
While many first time readers report Benjy s section as being difficult to understand these same readers often find Quentin s section to be near impossible
Not only do chronological events mesh together regularly but often Faulkner completely disregards any semblance of grammar spelling or punctuation instead writing in a rambling series of words phrases and sentences that have no separation to indicate where one thought ends and another begins
This confusion is due to Quentin s severe depression and deteriorating state of mind and Quentin is therefore arguably an even more unreliable narrator than his brother Benjy
Because of the staggering complexity of this section it is often the one most extensively studied by scholars of the novel
Part 3 April 6 1928 The third section is narrated by Jason the third child and his mother Caroline s favorite
It takes place the day before Benjy s section on Good Friday
Of the three brothers sections Jason s is the most straightforward reflecting his single minded desire for material wealth
By 1928 Jason is the economic foundation of the family after his father s death
He supports his mother Benjy and Miss Quentin as well as the family s servants
His role makes him bitter and cynical with little of the passionate sensitivity that marks his older brother and sister
He goes so far as to blackmail Caddy into making him Miss Quentin s sole guardian then uses that role to steal the support payments that Caddy sends for her daughter
This is the first section that is narrated in a linear fashion
It follows the course of Good Friday a day in which Jason decides to leave work to search for Miss Quentin who has run away again seemingly in pursuit of mischief
Here we see most immediately the conflict between the two predominant traits of the Compson family which Caroline attributes to the difference between her blood and her husband s on the one hand Miss Quentin s recklessness and passion inherited from her grandfather and ultimately the Compson side on the other Jason s ruthless cynicism drawn from his mother s side
This section also gives us the clearest image of domestic life in the Compson household which for Jason and the servants means the care of the hypochondriac Caroline and of Benjy
Part 4 April 8 1928 April 8 1928 is Easter Sunday
This section the only one without a single first person narrator focuses on Dilsey the powerful matriarch of the black family servants
She in contrast to the declining Compsons draws a great deal of strength from her faith standing as a proud figure amid a dying family
On this Easter Sunday Dilsey takes her family and Benjy to the colored church
Through her we sense the consequences of the decadence and depravity in which the Compsons have lived for decades
Dilsey is mistreated and abused but nevertheless remains loyal
She with the help of her grandson Luster cares for Benjy as she takes him to church and tries to bring him to salvation
The preacher s sermon inspires her to weep for the Compson family reminding her that she s seen the family through its destruction which she is now witnessing
Meanwhile the tension between Jason and Miss Quentin reaches its inevitable conclusion
The family discovers that Miss Quentin has run away in the middle of the night with a carnival worker having found the hidden collection of cash in Jason s closet and taken both her money and her money obsessed uncle s life savings
Jason calls the police and tells them that his money has been stolen but since it would mean admitting embezzling Quentin s money he doesn t press the issue
He therefore sets off once again to find her on his own but loses her trail in nearby Mottson and gives her up as gone for good
After church Dilsey allows her grandson Luster to drive Benjy in the family s decrepit horse and carriage to the graveyard
Luster disregarding Benjy s set routine drives the wrong way around a monument
Benjy s hysterical sobbing and violent outburst can only be quieted by Jason who understands how best to placate his brother
Jason slaps Luster turns the carriage around and in an attempt to quiet Benjy hits Benjy breaking his flower stalk while screaming Shut up
After Jason gets off the carriage and Luster heads home Benjy suddenly becomes silent
Luster turns around to look at Benjy and sees Benjy holding his drooping flower
Benjy s eyes are empty and blue and serene again
Appendix Compson 1699 1945 In 1945 Faulkner wrote an appendix to the novel to be published in the then forthcoming anthology The Portable Faulkner
At Faulkner s behest however subsequent printings of The Sound and the Fury frequently contain the appendix at the end of the book it is sometimes referred to as the fifth part
Having been written sixteen years after The Sound and the Fury the appendix presents some textual differences from the novel but serves to clarify the novel s opaque story
The appendix is presented as a complete history of the Compson family lineage beginning with the arrival of their ancestor Quentin Maclachlan in America in 1779 and continuing through 1945 including events that transpired after the novel
In particular the appendix reveals that Caroline Compson died in 1933 upon which Jason had Benjy committed to the state asylum fired the black servants sold the last of the Compson land and moved into an apartment above his farming supply store
It is also revealed that Jason had himself declared Benjy s legal guardian many years ago without their mother s knowledge and used this status to have Benjy castrated
The appendix also reveals the fate of Caddy last seen in the novel when her daughter Quentin is still a baby
After marrying and divorcing a second time Caddy moved to Paris where she lived at the time of the German occupation
In 1943 the librarian of Yoknapatawpha County discovered a magazine photograph of Caddy in the company of a German staff general and attempted separately to recruit both Jason and Dilsey to save her Jason at first acknowledging that the photo was of his sister denied that it was she after realizing the librarian wanted his help while Dilsey pretended to be unable to see the picture at all
The librarian later realizes that while Jason remains cold and unsympathetic towards Caddy Dilsey simply understands that Caddy neither wants nor needs to be saved from the Germans because nothing else remains for her
The appendix concludes with an accounting for the black family who worked as servants to the Compsons
Unlike the entries for the Compsons themselves which are lengthy detailed and told with an omniscient narrative perspective the servants entries are simple and succinct
Dilsey s entry the final in the appendix consists of two words They endured

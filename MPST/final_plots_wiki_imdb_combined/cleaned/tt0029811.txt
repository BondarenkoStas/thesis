Christine Clay a famous actress receives a surprise visit from Guy a husband she hasn t seen in eight years
Guy reminds her he dragged her out of the gutter to make her a star
He s furious that she left him outraged over her silly Reno divorce and indignant that she is playing around with young men in particular a struggling writer staying near them at their retreat on the English coast
They argue vehemently until a furious Christine slaps her husband s face four times
He keeps calm except for his eyes which twitch uncontrollably and departs A day or two later Robert Tisdall a local writer happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine s body washes ashore and he sees her body on the beach
He runs to get help or call the police and is seen by two young female swimmers who think that he is the escaping murderer Police arrive and arrest Tisdall on the testimony of the two witnesses
Also he is known to own a raincoat matching the murder weapon a belt coiled in the form of a large question mark that lay near the corpse
Robert claims innocence but in the crowd that has gathered none believe him
At first Tisdall is confident that it s all a misunderstanding After an overnight interrogation at the police station it s established that he knew Christine and is struggling economically so his motive seems to be 1 200 left to him in her will
Robert faints and is revived by Erica Burgoyne the attractive young daughter of the Chief Constable Colonel Burgoyne and whom was one of the two women who witnessed him fleeing the beach scene
She seems quite at ease in ordinary male company talking back vigorously to make her points or get her way Saddled with a hopelessly inadequate greedy barrister Briggs Tisdall believes his innocence will never be proven as the claim that his raincoat was stolen at a lorry station a few days before is not believed
As he is about to go on trial he escapes from the crowded courthouse corridor by donning his defense lawyer s glasses then stows away in Erica s dilapidated Morris automobile
A reporter with a camera is as at the steps of the court house Robert explains his situation to Erica and vows to recover the lost raincoat identify the real killer and prove his innocence
At first Erica doesn t believe Tisdall is innocent but she is attracted to the young man so she continues to help him elude capture and search for the stolen coat that might lead to the real killer
She drops him off at an abandoned mill so he can hide out At dinner at home Erica s brothers discuss the suspect s escape his need for money sleep and food to stay on the run The next day she brings him food a bit of money and they have a talk in depth which changes her attitude towards him
I can laugh because I m innocent he tells Erica
You don t believe me
I wish you did
After eating Robert nonchalantly flips a wrapper through a broken window at the precise moment that local foot policemen happen to glance in that direction
The policemen come into the mill and Erica and Robert must rush off in the Morris
They are spotted together so the police suspect she is his accomplice During their flight they stop at the home of Erica s aunt where her seven year old daughter Felicity is having a birthday party
Erica enters alone planning to just call her father and check in but she is dragged into the party
Uncle Basil arrives and finds Robert waiting outside and brings him inside assuming he is Erica s beau
Aunt Margaret becomes suspicious
Just as they get away in the Morris Margaret calls her brother Chief Constable Burgoyne who in turn alerts police to be on the lookout for them Their search takes them to Tom s Hat the diner where the raincoat was stolen where they learn that a china mender known as Old Will got a new raincoat recently and that he hangs out at a lodging named Nobby s
Erica s attitude ends up triggering a brawl and Robert needs to rescue her They find Nobby s Robert changes into seedy clothes enters and asks about Old Will after leaving Erica to sleep in the car hidden behind the freight train as she can t stay awake any more The next morning in the lodging house full of snoring vagrants dead cockroaches and peeling paint Tisdall finally meets the colorful hobo named Old Will
After hearing the story retold Will agrees to help them find the man who gave him the garment a stranger with noticeably twitching eyes who presumably is the murderer Erica s dog meantime has smelled that Will is actually wearing the raincoat in question three layers down from the outer one Police cars come chasing and they succeed in losing them by crossing railroad tracks in the nick of time before two long trains block the way and a huge trailer truck further delays them at the gate beyond They attempt to hide by driving into an abandoned mine where the Morris starts to sink into tunnels below and Erica has to be pulled to safety by one hand by Robert in the nick of time
The police find the mine Robert flees but Erica is brought to her father who is about to tender his resignation over the incident That night after she has a serious talk with her father who shows her a letter of resignation she is in her bedroom when Robert comes in the window and she rushes to hug him
He tells her lovingly that he will turn himself in shortly to spare her anguish and relieve her conscience
As they talk he learns that in a pocket of the coat matches from the Grand Hotel have been found a place where Tisdall has never been Together they decide that s a last clue worth pursuing
Erica will take Will there to see if the twitchy eyed man may still be around and Robert will find his own way there independently Old Will dresses up in a new uncomfortable morning coat in order to infiltrate the hotel with Erica but spotting a man with a twitch in the large crowd proves impossible In a memorable sequence the camera moves forward through the hotel lobby to the ballroom and the dancers to finally focus on the drummer in a dance band performing in blackface and his eyes twitch The drummer Guy recognizes Old Will in the audience and seeing the policemen unaware that they are there to arrest Tisdall the man performs poorly due to increasing nervousness and fear to the point he is berated by the musical conductor
Guy proceeds to have a breakdown precipitated by a drug he takes to excess to try to control the twitching
He begins banging drums and cymbals out of synch helplessly falling over the instruments and passes out while the other musicians stare at him Just then the police have found Robert and Old Will and Erica and are escorting them out
As hotel staff ask around to find medical help for Guy Erica offers her experience and the police who know her allow her to approach the unconscious Guy
As Erica tends to him his eyes twitch she realizes who he might be
Immediately after being revived Guy confesses his crime and laughs hysterically
The police drag him away cackling maniacally In the final scene Robert Tisdall and Erica Burgoyne are united
Her father arrives and seems happy to shake his hand as if welcoming him into the family THE END

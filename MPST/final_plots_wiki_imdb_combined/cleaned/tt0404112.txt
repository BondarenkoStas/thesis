The hunter has become the hunted as 47 is seriously wounded by one of his own targets who seems to have been expecting him
Bleeding to death and taking refuge in a hotel room somewhere in Paris France 47 drifts in and out of consciousness as an army of heavily armed National Police units converge around the hotel
The newest game Hitman Blood Money has a level in which 47 is hired to kill an actor and U S
Ambassador to the Vatican at the Opera house in Paris
At the end of the level a French policeman on the other side of the street notices him getting away from the crime scene and cocks his gun
It is also noteworthy that the gun he cocks appears to be a M1911 the pistol used by members of the Franchise the main antagonists in the sequel
This could possilbly allude to the fact that the Chief of Police could be involved with the Franchise for there is no other plausible explanation that could explain how he knew who 47 was
The scene ends here but it s possible to conclude that 47 gets badly wounded afterwards
The very first mission of Hitman Blood Money is a flashback mission in a funfair in which Diana welcomes 47 to the US
Between Curtains Down and this mission is when Hitman Contracts occurs It should be noted however that Contracts and Blood Money arguably contradict each other at points
The ending of Contracts shows that Diana is aware that the Agency is being targeted and she knows who is coming after them
It s implied that 47 will be going after their attackers immediately
However in Blood Money 47 isn t informed that he s being hunted until near the end of the game
Besides this arguable continuity error the briefing for Curtain s Down is different that the briefing 47 got in Contracts in the appearances of the two targets from Curtain s Down and one of their names
Also the Inspector 47 must kill in Contracts isn t even mentioned in Curtain s Down
However it could be argued that 47 was intended to kill the inspector after the events of Curtain s Down as the Inspector did not attend the opera house
47 s monologue at the beginning of Hunter and Hunted however could imply that 47 was taking the personal decision to assassinate the inspector on the basis that he knew too much about 47 Hitman Contracts story centers on 47 s flashbacks to earlier assignments
Many of the game s missions are re imaginings of previous ones in the series
Almost all of the major missions from Hitman Codename 47 have been re made and included in Contracts the exceptions being the Colombia levels which were scheduled to be included but were dropped and the final two levels
The locations visited include Budapest Hong Kong Paris Romania Rotterdam Siberia and the United Kingdom As is the case with the overlapping of Hitman Blood Money there are also some contradictions between the recollected missions and their counterparts in Hitman Codename 47 for example in the two incarnations of the mission Traditions Of The Trade the first demonstrated Hitman checking into the Hotel Galar under the alias Tobias Rieper which was used multiple times during the game in the latter he anaesthetized a representative of one of the countries attending the UF peace conference being held at the hotel and checked in under his name Mr Metzger
Also in the first mission the bodies of 18 48 series clones can be seen littered all over the asylum even though 47 only killed 10 clones in the first game
Though this is true this could merely be how 47 reimagines it in the flashbacks he has so the developers may not have been attempting to be true to the game canon

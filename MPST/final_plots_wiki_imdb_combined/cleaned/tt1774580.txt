Two college students Rick Taylor and Jennifer Willis take refuge from a storm in West Mansion a local landmark known as Splatterhouse for the rumors of hideous experiments purportedly conducted there by Dr West a renowned and missing parapsychologist
As they enter the mansion and the door shuts behind them Jennifer screams
Rick awakens in a dungeon under the mansion having been resurrected thanks to the influence of the Terror Mask or in some versions the Hell Mask a Mayan sacrificial artifact from West s house which is capable of sentient thought
The mask attaches itself to Rick fusing with his body and transforming him into a monster with superhuman strength
With the mask s encouragement Rick goes on a rampage through the dungeon and the mansion grounds killing hordes of monsters
Inside the mansion Rick finds Jennifer prone on a couch and surrounded by a throng of creatures that retreat upon his arrival
After their departure Jennifer transforms into a giant fanged monster that attempts to kill Rick while begging him for help
Rick is forced to kill Jennifer who transforms back to normal and thanks him before she dies
Infuriated Rick tracks the remaining monsters to a giant bloody hole in the mansion s floor
Upon entering it Rick discovers that the mansion itself is alive
He follows a bloody hallway to the house s womb which produces fetus like monsters that attack him
Rick destroys the womb which causes the house to burst into flames as it dies
Escaping the burning mansion Rick comes across a grave marker
The Terror Mask releases energy into the grave reviving a giant monster named Hell Chaos that claws its way up from the earth and attempts to kill Rick
Rick destroys the creature which unleashes a tormented ghost that dissipates into a series of bright lights
As the lights vanish the mask shatters turning Rick back to normal and he flees as the house burns to the ground and the credits roll
However after he leaves and the credits end the Terror Mask reassembles itself and laughs evilly staying there for 45 seconds with the word END appearing on the bottom right corner of the screen

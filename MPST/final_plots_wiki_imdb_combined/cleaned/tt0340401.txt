TimeSplitters 2 starts off in the year 2401 in the midst of a war between humanity and the TimeSplitters an alien race bent on the destruction of mankind
However rather than use brute force to destroy humanity they are using the special objects called time crystals to travel through time changing the course of history bringing Earth to ruin
Two space marines from Earth Sergeant Cortez and Corporal Hart are sent out to a space station overrun by TimeSplitters to retrieve the time crystals
However when they reach the bridge they are too late as they see the last few TimeSplitters take the time crystals into various time periods using the time portal
While Sergeant Cortez and Corporal Hart are preparing the time portal to follow the Timesplitters they are attacked by another squad of Timesplitters
Corporal Hart decides to stay at the bridge to keep the Timesplitters at bay while Cortez goes into different periods of time to retrieve the time crystals
Upon arrival at each time period Cortez takes the form of a person from that particular period of time similar to Quantum Leap
For example when Cortez arrives in the Wild West he takes the form of a bounty hunter
When he arrives in a 24th century robot factory he takes the form of a robot
After Cortez retrieves all of the time crystals he returns to the space station to rendezvous with Hart
The TimeSplitters outside finally manage to break into the bridge
Corporal Hart is killed in the ensuing battle
Cortez has little time to mourn as the Timesplitters become relentless to retrieve the Time Crystals from him
Cortez manages to set the station to self destruct and escape before its destruction
This leads into the events of TimeSplitters Future Perfect

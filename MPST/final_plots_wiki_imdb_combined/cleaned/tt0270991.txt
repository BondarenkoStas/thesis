Vista del Mar College Los Angeles Young Goth girls are committing ritual suicide
The last two were daughters of one of the professors at the college
One of his colleague Professor Fulton Muse Watson sees the Goth movement as a deadly cult phase that kills innocent kids
Fulton s student Tom Weidder Jeff Marchelletta doesn t agree
In his opinion Goths are simply disenfranchised
Tom is friends with several Goths e g
Fatal Nora Zimmett an art student who has just discovered that she s pregnant with the baby of coven owner Anubus Fatal s brother Blood Trevor Goddard who runs a Children of the Night website to recruit new members and Anubus Mark Irvingsen himself Fatal s lover a business administration student who opened a vampire coven to cash in on the lifestyle and the profits Blood an employee of Anubus has amassed such a following that he decides to start his own coven
His goal is to become King of the vampires and start a new religion based on the idea that female vampires when they are no longer useful to the coven should be willing to kill themselves in order to fertilize the ground with their seed and spawn a dominant order of male vampires with Blood as their holy father
Their reward is to be granted immortality Neither Tom nor Fatal can go along with Blood s goals
Tom is having personal problems in that his mother is dying of cancer and Prof Fulton has kicked him out of the program because of his bad attendance
In a fit of rationality Tom calls Fatal s child another martyr for the cause
In a fit of conscience Fatal aborts the baby and comes down with a massive case of infection requiring her to be hospitalized for over a week
She tells Blood that it was Tom who helped her come to the decision to kill her baby
While Fatal is in the hospital receiving therapy Blood pays Tom a visit
Blood apparently believes that Tom is not lying when he denies any knowledge of Fatal s decision so Blood offers Tom a job in his soon to be opened coven Syn City
Tom tells himself that he s going to use this opportunity to investigate the thoughts and philosophies of the Goths Meanwhile Blood vows to avenge the death of Fatal s child by ruining Anubus
First is to steal Anubus s coven members
Then Blood torches Anubus s club which results only in the authorities suspecting Anubus as torching his own club for the insurance money
Third Anubus is arrested on a tip that he was involved in grand theft auto
All this publicity is also playing havoc with Fatal s readjustment after being released from the hospital
She returns to her dorm to find her door spray painted with words such as Die and Bitch
She has to hock her car to get the bail money for Anubus s release
Tom has taken on the dress and attitudes of Blood s following and no longer wants to be Fatal s friend
Fatal is tempted to try coke again but resists and washes it down the sink Syn City Blood s Opening Night It doesn t go well for Blood
He s raided by the police who tell him that they re shutting down his club
Anubus attends the opening
Blood shoots Anubus and then turns the gun on himself
Next scene Tom is back to normal typing on his computer and he even hangs his crucifix back on the wall
On the other hand Fatal returns to the club in full vampire goth dress
The moral
Up to you

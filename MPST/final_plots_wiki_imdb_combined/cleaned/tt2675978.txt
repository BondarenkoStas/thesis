Khaalujaan uncle dear and his nephew Babban a thief duo pose as a Nawab and his attendant and manage to run away with a prized necklace from a jewellery shop
During the police chase they get separated Babban escapes while Khalujaan is injured
Months later Babban traces Khalujan again posing as a nawab this time at a poetry contest
It is a mushaira organised by Begum Para the widowed Begum of Majidabad supposedly in compliance with the wishes of her deceased husband
The winner of the poetry contest will win the widowed Begum as his bride and become the Nawab of Majidabad
Babban traces Khalujaan on the opening night of the contest
There is another adventurous rascal in the fray a local MLA gangster named Jaan Mohammed who is making the poet Nawab Italwi write poetry for him to recite at the contest
The contest proceeds while Khalujaan has his heart set on Begum Para herself Babban falls in love with her maid Muniya
Khalujaan tries to impress the Begum by giving her the prized necklace which he had stolen earlier but on the final day Begum declares Jaan Mohammed to be the victor
She declares that she will marry him and then he will become the new nawab of Majidabad
Since the necklace has clearly failed to move the Begum Khaalujaan decides to see if a gun will serve the purpose better
However even as he approaches the Begum brandishing his chosen instrument of persuasion he finds the dowager being hustled away at gunpoint by a masked man
Khalujaan chases them and blocks their way only to discover that the masked man is none other than his nephew Babban
It turns out that the Begum had plotted her own kidnapping in order to extort money from the nawab elect
More twists are then revealed the Begum was nothing but a dancing girl who had seduced a middle aged nawab and married him only to find that the nawab was actually a pauper who supported his lavish way of life by selling his inherited properties and jewels
He also neglected his wife who developed a relationship of intimacy with a sympathetic maid servant Muniya
By the time the nawab died of good living he had become completely bankrupt and even his palace had been mortgaged to the money lenders
After his death the penniless Begum had been helped financially and courted by Jaan Mohammad a local rich man who was besotted with her and wanted to marry her
He also wanted the title and status of being the Nawab of Majidabad which according to the movie would be conferred on the man who marries the widowed Begum
However Jaan Mohammad was a man of low birth and uncultured mannerisms a former street thug turned businessman turned politician who even employed a bunch of beefy goons to promote his business and political interests
The idea of marrying such a man was repellent to the Begum who was anyway in love with her maid servant
It was also socially unacceptable which is what the Begum tells Jaan Mohammad
It is he who comes up with the idea of holding a contest
The birth and breeding of the man who wins the contest will be irrelevent the begum can say that she had no choice but the marry the winner
Thus the mushiara itself is an elaborate hoax the late nawab had never stipulated that his widow should marry someone else much less that the winner should be recognized as nawab of Majidabad
It was the Begum s own idea the purpose being to snare a rich man and marry him
The Begum did not want to marry Jaan Mohammad but she wanted his money therefore she was staging a kidnapping in order to receive a ransom from Jaan Mohammad
She has employed Babban to act as her kidnapper and extort a hefty ransom from Jaan Mohammad who was expected to pay up because otherwise he would never fulfill his dream of becoming a Nawab
Babban duly phones Jaan Mohammed to bring a ransom of 10 crore rupees in cash to the railway station
All four of them reach the railway station to collect the money but find that they are surrounded by Jaan Mohammad s goons and henchmen
To their good fortune Nawab Italwi arrives with a police force and cross firing starts
Begum and Muniya escape from the situation leaving behind Babban and Khalujaan to be arrested
Two months later the uncle nephew duo get bail and as they leave the jail they are given a letter from Begum and Muniya
It is a cheeky letter of thanks and goodbye from the women informing the men that they have sold the priceless necklace and used the proceeds to buy a house and settle down in a faraway town whose name they withhold
Uncle and nephew are now exactly at the same situation where they were at the start of all these shenanigans the movie ends with the duo once again surrounded by Mushtaq and his gang of rowdy vagrants

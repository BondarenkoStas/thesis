Sgt
Mario Cari√±o s squad along with a platoon of soldiers led by a Lieutenant is seen chasing Muslim rebels across a forest was trapped and forced to retreat when an ambush was sprung losing some of his squadmates
Upon returning to the camp he was scolded by his superior for his insubordination which he accepted begrudgingly
His squadmates heckled him which he answered
Camp life is always tense with rebel snipers taking out sentries being bombed and retaliated upon by regular patrols in the area they never forget why they are there
Sometimes they go to a town where they buy supplies and treats for Muslim kids which they give upon Mario spotted a beautiful storekeeper
They do charitable works which coincidentally a rebel Emir is in the same village but halted by an Ulama to harm them
They were later confronted upon by the same Emir revealed to be the kid s uncle
Mario saved the kid earlier from drowning
A sniper took out a sentry alarming the platoon while Mario gets his regular taste of scolding by his commander
Days later they welcomed several Privates led by a hot headed Private and his batchmates
Some older soldiers extorted the newbies
And when a fellow soldier was heckled by his fellow for being in love with a beautiful young woman a brawl started among the other soldiers until an explosion interrupted the fight forcing them to lie down and were later punished by the Lieutenant
The soldier later committed suicide when he found out that the girl has broken up with him
Rebels always harassing and looting Christian villages which the soldiers always chased upon
He later got a leave which his friend requested that he must visit his family nearby
Mario s life is further revealed that he has a fiancee and his father is sick
His friend s wife is a blind woman
Many days later he returns to camp giving goods to his fellow soldiers
He tried to court the lass when he was stopped upon by a group of fellow soldiers from a different unit he countered by showing some firepower which the soldiers fled
But they fled upon when they spotted a truckful of soldiers to chase them out
He later received a letter from his parents which his father died in sickness and he requested leave which his Lieutenant declines
He snapped and in drunken stupor shoots his officer s bunker leading him to be reprimanded by their Colonel in the office
The lieutenant was replaced by another newbie Lieutenant
Mario was forced to obey the new officer
As their new commander made him organize a patrol the newbie soldiers joined him
When they patrol the forest another ambush was sprung killing some soldiers including the three newbie soldiers and they were forced to retreat once again
Mario was blamed by his commander which led to him punching his commander and a brawl started stopped only when another explosion was heard
He later took the storekeeper in camp but trouble starts when his fiancee came into the camp
The soldiers help the lass escape while Mario distracts his fiancee
The platoon was later tasked to meet up with a rebel Emir to talk to them but indecisive results
As rebels disagree for their Emir s decision they kill a soldier from the unit along with his wife when they were abducted
The ringleader was executed by the Emir himself which angers some rebels once again
They ambush the Lieutenant s batchmate s unit which Mario rescued
And another ambush which involves the Lieutenant s patrol unit was saved by Mario s squad
And the rebels used the incident as an excuse to attack the camp
Mario received his Officer Promotion exam results and ready to return to main base when the rebels fire upon the camp with mortars and grenade launchers killing some of them and putting the rest in their defensive position
They defended and repulsed an attack
As they send some runners the runners was killed by the rebels and the rescue unit was bombed and killed by the rebels
The rescue unit s leader was captured and tied on a tree and Mario s unit short in ammunition and outgunned was forced to watch as rebels slashed the hapless officer which their Lieutenant forced himself to euthanize his fellow officer
Romy tried to rescue the commander when he was killed by a rebel shot him in his M203 grenades
And another juramentado attack by rebels kills Mario s partner but repulsed with heavy casualties
Mario the Lieutenant the squad s sniper the newbie soldier and three others prepare themselves in a last stand when explosions are heard this time on the government s side
The government backup fire upon the rebels with mortars rockets and air support inflicting the rebels heavy casualties and forced them to retreat
The soldiers retrieve the dead the Lieutenant unties his fellow batchmate s corpse as the rain falls down Mario was seen crying while kneeling
The film ends with Mario quoting that Nobody wins in a war

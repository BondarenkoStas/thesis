The short story involves Mr and Mrs White and their adult son Herbert
Sergeant Major Morris a friend who served with the British Army in India introduces them to a mummified monkey s paw
An old fakir placed a spell on the paw that it would grant three wishes to three separate men
The wishes are granted but always with hellish consequences as punishment for tampering with fate
Morris tells the Whites of his comrade who used his third wish to wish for death
Morris also having had a horrific experience upon using the paw throws the monkey s paw into the fire but Mr White retrieves it
Before leaving Morris warns Mr White that if he does use the paw then it will be on his own head
At Herbert s suggestion Mr White wishes for 200 to be used as the final payment on his house even though he believes he has everything he wants
The next day his son Herbert leaves for work at a local factory
Later that day word comes to the White home that Herbert has been killed in a terrible machinery accident
Although the employer denies responsibility for the incident the firm has decided to make a goodwill payment to the family of the deceased
The payment of 200 exactly matches the amount Herbert suggested his father should wish for
Ten days after their son s death and a week after the funeral Mrs White almost mad with grief asks her husband to use the paw to wish Herbert back to life
Reluctantly he does so
Shortly afterward there is a knock at the door
As Mrs White fumbles at the locks in an attempt to open the door Mr White who had to identify his son s mutilated body and who knows the corpse has been buried for more than a week realizes that the thing outside is not the son he knew and loved and makes his third wish
The knocking suddenly stops
Mrs White opens the door to find no one is there

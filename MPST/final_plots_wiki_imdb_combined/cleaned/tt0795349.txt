Nichols and his squad participate in the successful capture of Saint Lô picking up a radio operator during the conflict Private First Class Salvatore Guzzo who immediately gets on the wrong side of McCullin during the fighting
After the battle the squad is folded into the 90th Infantry Division and sent to secure the wooded area of Saint Germain Sur Seves where intense hedgerow fighting took place
Soon after the 90th assaults the town of Mayenne as part of an operation to capture and secure a heavily guarded bridge in the town with Huxley tasked with defusing aerial bombs planted on it to stop the American advance
When Huxley is wounded just before he can step onto the bridge McCullin steps in to do the job knowing the type of bomb being used but is killed in the process shortly after dealing with the last bomb
Dixon soon assumes command of the squad and is promoted to sergeant

The squad then participates in clearing out a nearby suburbs with a vital crossroads where during the assault Dixon is wounded but survives
After taking a shortcut through some sewers they find the crossroads and secure it with the help of a few Sherman tank divisions
After the assault Dixon takes a radio call and informs his squad with news about the success of the Canadian and Polish forces in the north and that the Falaise Gap plan is being implemented to trap the Germans between the Allies with them as the stopping power against any retreat by Axis forces at their next destination
Following successful work by the Canadians Polish and British troops the unit finds themselves defending the town of Chambois from Axis forces trying to run through the Falaise Gap
While the squad hold position against a fierce assault they soon become heavily out gunned and flee to a rally point at a church with the Germans in pursuit
The squad continue to fall back while Guzzo calls in air support against heavy German emplacements before the squad are sent to the other side of town to assist in defending against more troops but Guzzo is wounded while setting up flares
Dixon and Nichols come to his aid and extract him to relative safety
However while treating Guzzo Dixon is shot in the back and dies a few moments later
Guzzo who had been often difficult while attempting to back off from fighting gains resolve from Dixon s last words and takes command of the squad
The squad soon begin giving much needed support to Baker Company and begin reclaiming the town before preparing to take on one final assault
The squad and the surviving soldiers soon move to make one last stand to hold off the Germans utilizing whatever equipment on hand to deal with enemy troops and tanks
Their efforts are successful when reinforcements finally arrive to sweep the last of the German resistance in the region into full surrender
Two days later in Chambois Guzzo is promoted to Sergeant whilst Huxley and Nichols are promoted to Corporal following the surrender of the surviving German forces to the Americans
With new men in their squad they continue to march into France as the Allied forces finally liberate Paris and gain access to Europe ending the Battle of Normandy
British French campaign During the British and French campaign the player controls Sergeant James Doyle a member of the British Special Air Service working alongside SAS members Corporal Keith and Major Ingram and members of the Maquis Resistance including their leader Pierre LaRoche a French SAS agent Isabelle DuFontaine and a man only known as Marcel and a trusted member of the Maquis
Hoping to add pressure to the German forces as they are engaged by Allied troops in the region the British deploy an SAS squad led by Ingram behind enemy lines to link up with a local resistance cell in the area and cut off their supply lines
Though the parachute drop is complicated when several 88 mm guns shoots down the squad s Handley Page Halifax the squad manage to bail out along with their equipment before the plane breaks apart
Soon after making contact with LeRoche leader of the Maquis SAS and French Resistance fighters recover one of the SAS jeeps and drive to meet other members before attacking a German anti aircraft position the same one that shot them down while rescuing a resistance member Marcel Lemonde who provides them with important plans after the escape from more troops
The French Resistance and SAS use these to help them try to destroy a German held fuel plant to cripple enemy armour in the region but while escaping during its destruction Ingram is captured causing tensions to rise between Keith and Marcel the former accusing the latter of collaborating with the Germans
Against the advice of the Resistance Keith and Doyle attempt to locate Ingram reluctantly aided by LaRoche and Isabelle
Soon after rescuing Ingram on the outskirts of a village French and British fighters attempt to stop the executions of captured Resistance fighters rushing to save as many as they can before holding out against a German assault
In the process the Resistance loses Isabelle who is killed after planting an explosive charge on an armored car
Although Marcel is hard hit by her loss Keith honours her sacrifice and reconciles with him
The remaining French Resistance pockets and the British Commandos soon group up and move out to gather with the Allies as they take the fight into the rest of Europe
Canadian campaign The Canadian aspect of the campaign involves members of the 4th Canadian Division
It is centered on Private Cole who is led by World War I veteran Lieutenant Jean Guy Robichaud a proud man with an often haphazard style of leadership often making assaults and completing objectives beyond his assigned mission at the risk of his own men
Robichaud commands a platoon in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada aided by his right hand man Sergeant Callard squad member Pvt Peterson and the squad s radio operator Pvt
Leslie Baron
The platoon begins initially with advancing on a ridge held by German forces in a night time operation before capturing an industrial area and successfully defending it from a large German counter attack after blocking off a few access points to ease their defenses
While the Polish 1st Armored Division guards their western flank the unit soon clears a forest near the Laison River of several anti tank positions and a motor pool during which Robichaud berates Baron over his lack of combat participation
Tension builds between the two and Baron insists that he is not a coward despite protecting the platoon s radio to which Robichaud dismisses him shortly before their next mission and assigns him to act as radio operator for a Polish armored unit needing urgent aid Baron is later killed in action
Robichaud soon proceeds to clear a town to rescue a captured Canadian tank crew but rather than withdraw with the rescued servicemen he decides to assist in capturing the whole town knowing the Polish need aid as soon as possible
After a King Tiger tank appears the men plant demolition charges in a German ammunition dump in a basement to destroy the tank
However one of the fuses proves defective and Callard manually detonates it sacrificing himself in the process to save the others
Robichaud and Cole are wounded by the blast but survive where a saddened Robichaud decides to nominate the fallen Callard for the Victoria Cross and promote Cole to corporal
They then soon start helping to move more Canadian reinforcements through the town to aid the Polish struggling to defend Hill 262
Polish campaign The Polish campaign revolves around Cpl
Bohater Wojciech a tank driver in the Polish 1st Armored Division hunting more German tanks in revenge to the occupation of the homeland of his crew members including Major Jachowicz Corporal Rudinski Sergeant Kowalski and Pte
Ulan
While aiding the Canadian and British forces in the area Jachowicz s crew participates in a sweep across the French countryside engaging German armor
Bohater and the rest of his tank crew eventually track down and destroy an infamous Tiger II tank commanded by a German Tank Captain known as Richter
The Poles later move out to capture Mount Ormel also known as Hill 262 and then setup into defensive positions at the base of the hill forced to endure a heavy assault by the remnants of the German 7th army desperate to escape the Falaise Pocket
Bohater and his crew defend the hill against several German tanks but eventually their tank is damaged as many German infantry units overrun their position forcing the crew to abandon it
They join in the battle alongside fellow Polish infantry units and other tank crews holding off the German offensive
The Poles continue to take heavy casualties including both Corporal Rudinski and Sergeant Kowalski while waiting for Canadian reinforcements and start to retreat up the Mace through pockets of German infested trenches
The Canadian radio operator Pte
Baron soon arrives to call in artillery support
When a German advance forces the Polish troops to fall back in the Mace Baron argues with them refusing to retreat since he is tired of being called a coward
He is shot and killed by the Germans and Ulan scavenges his radio which he uses to call for artillery strikes
In the final stand against the German counterattack Jachowicz commands Bohater and the surviving soldiers to defend the hill against the advancing German troops
He defends the other side of the hill and finally as green flares illuminate the skies the Royal Canadian Air Force commence bombing runs on the German troops and armor
Reinforcements then arrive to aid the Poles on Hill 262
After the victory Lieutenant Robichaud fresh from his earlier battle arrives and talks with Jachowicz over his fallen comrades in which Robichaud commends the Major for his men s excellent job at defending the hill while Jachowicz hopes to return their bodies to his homeland after the war
The men soon talk about the Germans and about their remaining escape route Chambois

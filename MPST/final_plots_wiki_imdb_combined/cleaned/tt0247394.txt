After murdering a rich man named Sohanlal and covering it up as a car accident a man named Khanna who ordered the hit is murdered as well by someone he is shocked to see
It is revealed that Sohanlal s murder was actually a conspiracy of many people also unknown
Before dying Khanna has told the news of Sohanlal s death to his niece Asha
Some days later eight people including Asha win a trip to an island in a chartered plane courtesy a lucky draw in a gala
The others winners are Barrister Rakesh Dharamdas Kishan Dr Acharya Madhusudan Sharma and Kitty Kelly
The seven people go to the island with one Anand who happens to be a crew member in the chartered plane
Suddenly the plane develops a snag causing it to cause an emergency landing
Along with Anand all the winners leave the plane along with their personal belongings
However everyone is amazed when the plane suddenly starts and the pilot flies away stranding them on the island
Unable to understand what is happening everybody tries to scout the place unsuccessfully
Suddenly a woman starts singing an ominous song
Partly trying to find the woman and partly trying to find the place where they were supposed to stay they finally reach their destination where they meet the butler
Later on the dinner table Dharamdas spots a diary which seems innocuous to him but Anand s facial expressions grow serious on reading the diary s contents
Anand reads the diaries contents to all of them which reveals that they are all connected to a crime and responsible for it
The writer of the diary says that he is going to kill all of them one per day
The butler claims that he knows nothing about the singing lady
As everybody retires to their rooms Anand spies on them finding out that the doctor has brought a bottle of poison with him and that Dharamdas has a revolver
Kishan catches him in the act but does nothing
Meanwhile the butler too is acting suspicious and his actions prove that there is at least one more person in the house
The very next day Kishan spots a ship
He Kitty and Dr Acharya try to signal the ship but in vain
Meanwhile Anand starts flirting with Asha
Rakesh and Kitty too take a shine for each other
Although everyone is suspicious of each other Rakesh has Anand at number one on his list
That night Kishan is murdered and his body is found by Anand and Asha
The killer has planted a note saying that Kishan was a killer who killed Sohanlal
It quickly becomes clear that the people know something about Sohanlal
Dharamdas seems to be the guilty party based on the deductions
He pleads innocence upon which Mr Sharma asks everybody to give him one day to prove his innocence
The very next night Dharamdas is found dead by Anand and Asha
Anand believes that the villain is amongst them while Rakesh believes that Dharamdas was poisoned and the doctor is the culprit based on what he saw
It is clear that any one of the four remaining men could be the killer
Kitty is revealed to be Sohanlal s personal secretary while Rakesh is the lawyer who had created the will on Khanna s orders
It is also revealed that Kitty was the one who sent the papers to Rakesh as instructed by Khanna although neither knew about each other
Asha has her own suspicions on Anand who clams up when she asks information about him
While talking to her Anand spots Rakesh hiding an axe
Soon the doctor arrives screaming that Sharma has been killed
It is clear that Sharma has been axed to death
The killer has sent another letter accusing Sharma to be the co conspirator of Khanna in the murder
Anand accuses Rakesh of the murder while Rakesh is now unsure about Anand s guilt
The doctor later catches butler engaging in a suspicious activity indicating that he knows the butler s secret now
A scuffle between the duo follows
While Asha and Kitty are in the dining room the doctor enters and falls down indicating that he has been stabbed
Before dying he manages to take Anand s name
Rakesh The now believes that Anand is the killer which Anand denies
Asha who begins to question her faith in Anand ends up drinking with Kitty
Anand and Asha have a fight over this
The next day Rakesh advises Asha to not to go alone anywhere
Asha reveals to him that she is searching for Kitty
Sensing something amiss the duo go to find her
Kitty has gone to swim but senses that she is not alone
She starts running but the unseen killer corners her and hangs her by a tree
Rakesh and Asha arrive at the scene too late but his suspicion is confirmed on seeing Anand s hat next to Kitty s hanged body
Rakesh starts chasing Anand but loses the trail
In rage he turns back to the mansion where he tries to rape Asha as a revenge
Asha somehow escapes his clutches and runs in the building but runs into Rakesh again just as he falls down revealing two daggers in his chest
With this horrifying development she loses her calm
At the very same moment the lights in the mansion go out indicating that the killer is here and she is the next target
As the killer who can not be seen now due to darkness approaches Asha she faints
He lifts her and enters a secret room in the building which leads downstairs
He brings her back to consciousness upon which she starts screaming for Anand
Now the criminal turns to her and is revealed to be Madhusudan Sharma
He reveals that Anand was growing suspicious of him following which he had to take the doctor in his confidence
The doctor lied that he was dead and to tie the loose end he killed the doctor before resuming his spree
Sharma also gets a shock of his life himself on seeing Anand in the secret room
Now it is revealed that Anand is Inspector Anand while Sharma is actually an escaped convict named Madanlal
Madanlal succeeds in overpowering both Anand and Asha and ties them
He explains them the whole story he Khanna and Sohanlal were smugglers
Once Madanlal got caught while his partners convinced him to take all the blame on himself
However after he went to jail Sohanlal raped Madanlal s sister who committed suicide
Madanlal s brother who informed him about the treachery was also killed by the duo
Khanna who later grew greedy had Sohanlal killed to usurp his money
Every person he killed till now was a party in the plan to murder Sohanlal
Anand knows more than Madanlal thinks the ghost singing the song is actually the butler s mentally unstable sister whom the butler had secretly brought here Madanlal killed Khanna and then saw to it that everybody including Asha got the lucky tickets
Meanwhile Madanlal plays a game of Russian Roulette with Anand and Asha while the butler sneaks in and stealthily frees Anand
When it is clear that Asha will get the bullet Anand suddenly attacks Madanlal
In a melee that occurs Madanlal escapes from the mansion and runs towards the shore with other on his pursuit
A plane comes which he tries to stop
As he runs towards the plane it is revealed that there were police in it who promptly arrest him
Anand and Asha board the plane along with the now free butler and his sister

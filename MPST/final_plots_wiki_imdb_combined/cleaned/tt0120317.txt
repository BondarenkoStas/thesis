Darn Cat or DC is a wily adventurous Siamese tomcat who lives with young suburbanite sisters Ingrid Inkie and Patricia Patti Randall whose parents are traveling abroad at the time of the story
One night while making his rounds around town teasing Blitzy the Bulldog as usual DC follows Iggy a bank robber to an apartment where he and his bank robber partner Dan are holding hostage a bank employee Miss Margaret Miller whom they nickname Moms
Without intention the robbers let the cat in and he tries to eat the food that caused him to follow Iggy
When Miss Miller is alone for a moment being forced to cook the meal for them she removes DC s collar and tries to put her watch around his neck with a help inscription
In the process she attempts to scratch the word help into the back of her watch
Then she releases him into the outdoors
When DC comes home Patti discovers the watch
She has a gut feeling that it belongs to the kidnapped woman and visits the FBI
She tells Agent Zeke Kelso of her discovery and Supervisor Newton assigns Kelso to follow DC in hopes he will lead them back to the robbers hideout
Kelso sets up a headquarters in the Randalls house and assigns a team to keep the cat under surveillance but through a couple of careless moves DC manages to elude them
Eventually a bugging device is implanted in DC s collar and the cat leads Kelso into a comical chase at a drive in movie and several backyards
After several failed attempts and without hard evidence about the watch Supervisor Newton shuts down the operation
Patti disguises herself as a hippie merchant who pretends to be a niece of a jeweler she knows well Mr Hoffsteddar and she calls the FBI to persuade them that the watch belonging to Miss Miller was indeed hard evidence
Patti and Kelso rescue Miss Miller and bring the robbers to justice
Subplots involve a romance between Patti s sister Ingrid and Gregory Benson and a romance between Patti herself and a surf obsessed slacker neighbor Canoe Henderson and the meddling of nosey neighbor Mrs MacDougall and her disapproving husband Wilmer MacDougall
At the end it is revealed that the gray cat in the opening sequence and DC have started a family
At the end they are taking their kittens on a prowl

Nehalata is a young modern girl who meets with an accident
The parents are concerned as their daughter is unable to recognise them
The doctor diagnoses her with retrograde amnesia that leaves her with the memory and intelligence of a six or seven year old
Circumstances lead her into prostitution and in the brothel she meets Somu
He realizes that she has been tricked into the trade
He rescues her and takes her to his home in Ooty where he lives with his grandmother and begins to take care of her
He knows Nehalata as Reshmi which was the pseudonym given to her at the brothel
Reshmi reciprocates Somu s care as they spend several months together sharing an amazing and innocent relationship that treads the tender line between affection and love
The sub plot of the film follows the wife of Somu s boss who is attracted to Somu though Somu doesn t reciprocate her feelings
It depicts how the outside world succumbs to carnal desires which have no place in Somu and Reshmi s relationship
Somu takes Reshmi to the village s medical practitioner who cures her and brings her back to sanity as she regains her memory up to the point of her accident
She boards a train that day back home with her parents
When Somu comes to meet Reshmi later that day she is unable to identify or remember him
Despite his efforts to make her understand that he was the one who had taken care of her for several months she is indifferent to him and leaves Ooty for her hometown thus abandoning Somu and the life and relationship that she once had with him

Real People featured a panel of seated hosts in front of a large studio audience
The hosts introduced pre filmed segments and engaged in comedic banter about them
Each segment was a visit to someone with a unique occupation or hobby
Occasionally someone was brought into the studio to interact with the audience
In its early seasons Real People was NBC s most popular series often scoring at the top of the ratings and was a rare hit for the network at a time when NBC was a distant third in the ratings and struggling with numerous flops
Segments included funny pictures and funny newspaper errors sent in by viewers who were awarded a Real People T shirt
According to a 2008 interview with producer George Schlatter who also co created Rowan Martin s Laugh In for NBC the series also covered serious topics such as war heroes
Regular hosts included John Barbour Sarah Purcell Byron Allen Skip Stephenson Bill Rafferty Mark Russell Peter Billingsley and Fred Willard
The success of Real People led to a batch of imitators the best known and longest running of which was That s Incredible
which aired on ABC and That s My Line on CBS hosted by Bob Barker
Real People gave fitness instructor Richard Simmons his major break into the mass media and spotlighted such unique talents as Pittsburgh Police traffic cop Vic Cianca
When repeats of the show were initially syndicated to broadcast stations it was edited into 30 minute segments and retitled More Real People
In 1980 NBC launched two attempts at spin offs Speak Up America and Real Kids
The former Speak Up America starred former child televangelist Marjoe Gortner and basically expanded the opening segment of Real People into a full hour program
The latter Real Kids starred Peter Billingsley and a cast of child hosts in a format that mirrored Real People but focused only on kids
Both spin off formats quickly failed though Billingsley went on to join Real People as a recurring host contributor
A one hour retrospective special aired on September 16 1991 with hosts Sarah Purcell and Fred Willard

Ten years after the end of World War II Tom Rath is living in suburban Connecticut with his wife Betsy and three children and having difficulty supporting his family on his salary writing for a nonprofit organization
Tom is also dealing with flashbacks from his combat service as an Army Captain in both the European and Pacific theaters involving men that he killed and a young Italian girl named Maria with whom he had a brief but heartfelt affair in Italy despite his being in a relationship with Betsy at the time
Before Tom left Maria for the final time to go back into battle Maria told Tom that she was pregnant and was going to keep the baby
Tom would never see her or the child again
When an expected inheritance from Tom s recently deceased grandmother turns out to have been depleted leaving only her large and not saleable mansion Betsy pressures Tom to seek a higher paying job
Acting on a tip from a fellow train commuter Tom interviews for an opening at the television network UBC but when asked to write his autobiography as part of the interview process he refuses
He is hired anyway for a public relations job helping the network president Ralph Hopkins launch a national mental health campaign
Hopkins is powerful and highly respected at the office but unbeknownst to his employees his workaholic habits have caused him to be estranged from his wife and his rebellious daughter who soon elopes with an unsuitable man
Tom is initially supervised by Bill Ogden a micromanager and office politician who rejects Tom s drafts of an important Hopkins speech intended to launch the campaign and substitutes a draft of his own consisting of what Ogden thinks Hopkins wants to hear
At first Tom plans to play along with office politics and accept Ogden s draft but coaxed by Betsy openly derides the draft as false modesty and presents his original ideas to Hopkins instead
Hopkins who has just received the unwelcome news of his daughter s elopement is receptive to Tom s criticism and thinks Tom resembles his own late son who refused to accept an officer s commission in World War II and was subsequently killed in action as an enlisted man
Hopkins now regrets having ignored his family and advises Tom not to make the same mistake
Meanwhile Betsy eager to move to a better house abruptly sells the family s modest dwelling and moves them into Tom s late grandmother s mansion Dragonwyck only to find that Edward the old woman s longtime caretaker at the mansion is claiming that Tom s grandmother had bequeathed him the estate
Judge Bernstein intercedes and presents evidence that suggests that not only did Edward forge the bequest letter but he also padded his bills to the grandmother thus depleting the estate and accumulating a large fortune in the town s bank that he could not otherwise explain
The Raths keep the mansion
At his new job Tom meets Caesar a sergeant with whom he d served in Italy now the UBC Building s elevator operator
Caesar who married Maria s cousin tells Tom that Maria and her illegitimate son by Tom are desperate for money in their still war ravaged country
Although Tom has previously kept his affair and the resulting child a secret from Betsy he decides to tell her remembering her advice to be honest about Hopkins speech
Betsy grows furious and speeds away in her car but she runs out of gas and they reconcile at the local police station
Tom and Betsy ask Judge Bernstein to set up a trust fund for Tom s son in Italy
That night Hopkins calls Tom to ask that he accompany Hopkins on a trip to California associated with the new campaign
Tom declines saying he just wants to work 9 to 5 and spend the rest of the time with his family which Hopkins respectfully accepts
Hopkins then thinks back on his decision on being more than a 9 to 5 job

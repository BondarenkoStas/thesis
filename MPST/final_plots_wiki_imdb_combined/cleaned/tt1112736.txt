In this off shoot of George Orwell s 1984 set in modern day USA in a small Florida town Tony is a young waiter who is going through life not doing anything out of the ordinary
The War on Terrorism has been going on for a few years now
A little curious of current events concerning terrorists he goes to a few Internet websites and checks out their Jihadest agenda political views Aljazera web TV broadcasts and on line beheadings Tony goes through life as usual once in a while covering a shift for a friend at work once in a while hooking up with Kaleam an Arab co worker with a great connection to hash that Tony likes to smoke once in a while
Problem is that Kaleam is on the terrorist watch list
His cell is tapped and since Tony has been talking to Kaleam for a while he is watched as well by unseen Homeland Security agents One night Kaleam phones Tony with something special something that will take him to paradise
Some of the best hash some killer X for he and his girlfriend to have a great long weekend together
Listening in on this phone conversation this sets off the alarms
Later that night as Tony sleeps the TTF does a sneak and snatch of his apartment It s a long holiday weekend
The apartment is raided and Tony and his girlfriend Jessica are bagged and swept drugged and taken away by Homeland Security soldiers
Tony and Jessica are seperated and they go through CIA style questioning from threats of drug charges to the edge and what some would consider torture of beatings since Tony visited Internet sites supporting terrorists and because of his association with Kaleam
Days pass as the interogations continue The TTF realize that Tony is just someone in the wrong place at the wrong time and indeed has no connections to terrorists
The couple are drugged programmed and placed back at home Tony wakes up the next day knowing something is wrong but his girlfriend is convinced that they did too much partying
Still thinking something is wrong he goes to the bathroom to shower and knock the webs out of his head
While shaving he notices a small needle mark on his neck
He leans into the mirror for a better look
We spin around looking back at Tony through the mirror following a cable up the wall to a blinking box with an antenna attached to a hidden camera on the other side of the mirror Cut to a plain white van sitting on the side of the road
Going through the blocked out window we see a man sitting in a surveillance van watching a monitor showing Tony looking at himself in the bathroom mirror
Pulling back we see the man watching Tony as well as many other people also on surveillence video screens US Library of Congress register WGA register 2005

Henriette Issabelle Teboul and Louise Alexandra Pic are blind orphans
They live at The Glycines Orphanage where they are among Sister Martha s Natalie Perrey favorites
She calls them her angels but angels they are not
In fact they re vampires
They are blinded by daylight but when the sun goes down they see perfectly albeit in blue shot through blue filters
During the night while everyone sleeps they slip out of the orphanage and go to their true home the cemetery looking for blood
At times they sit amongst the graves and talk about their travels the interesting creatures they have met their previous lives and where they might have come from
They have reincarnated so many times that the memories are dim
They like to think of themselves as blood drinking goddesses for whom the Aztecs performed human sacrifices When Sister Martha s dream that Henriette and Louise would be adopted by the famous opthalmologist Dr Dennery Bernard Charnac√© comes true they go to live with their new father in his big house in Paris
Everyone thinks the blind girls are so sweet and pure but when the night comes and their vision returns they continue to slip out to find victims and play in the little cemetery near their house
Then one afternoon Dr Dennery announces that he must attend a conference and will be gone overnight
He makes them promise that they won t leave the house but as soon as he is gone they head for the Metro and go to visit a BIG cemetery looks like Montmartre cemetery to me
When evening comes on and their sight returns they hop and skip around
Unfortunately they are seen by an elderly couple who had seen them earlier as they made their way around with canes
They re creatures from hell
exclaims the woman and the man runs after them with a stick but they elude him
A bit later the man sees them drinking blood from a young girl s neck and chases them again
They hide in a crypt where they meet a bat woman who gives them refuge for the night in her own coffin The next morning Henriette and Louise return home
On the way they feel thirsty so they slake their thirst on each other
Then they stop at a liquor store to buy some brandy to clean their necks
By the time they get home they re both roaring drunk so drunk they don t make it into the house before the doctor returns
After parking his car he finds the empty liquor bottle sees movement in the bushes and fires off a gunshot hitting Louise
While the doctor searches the grounds Henriette gets Louise upstairs and under the bedcovers
After the doctor has checked on them and gone to bed himself Henriette tells Louise a story about Aztec sacrifices while Louise drinks some of Henriette s blood to strengthen her The girls begin to fear that the doctor will kill them if he finds out the truth
So they plot to kill him first but they can t come up with a good plan
Just as they are reading a book about crimes the doctor walks in
They make up a story about how their vision has started to return and how they were waiting to tell him about it on his birthday next weekend
He wants to examine their eyes but first he s going to make some breakfast
While they eat Henriette goes to the cupboard takes out a knife and stabs the doctor in the back
When he is dead they gather their things set the house on fire and leave But where to go
Back to the orphanage of course
They slip into their old room and put on nightclothes
After Sister Martha has made her rounds they enter the room of poor sick Virginia
They decide not to drink the blood of a sick girl and instead sneak outside to join two other girls who have snuck out to smoke a cigarette
When Sister Martha finds the canes of her two angels in their old bedroom and smells cigarettes she goes to investigate and finds Henriette and Louise their mouths all bloodied and the two other orphans with bites on their necks Henriette and Louise run from the orphanage and hide in a barn
When Nicole comes to milk the cows they befriend her tell her who they really are and bemoan the fact that people will be after them
They must return to their cemetery
Nicole says that she knows a shortcut and will guide them there as it is almost daylight
Unfortunately they are seen by the old man and woman from the big cemetery
The old man recognizes them grabs his gun and shoots Henriette
Henriette is dying
She asks Louise to find a hole to hide in
They wade out into a marsh
Henriette slips under the water first followed by Louise

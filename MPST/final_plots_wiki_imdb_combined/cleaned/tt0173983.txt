Snoopy is lying on top of his doghouse when he hears music
He follows the music and finds a circus unloading
Among other animals he sees three poodles and immediately latches onto the white one
He follows her to the entrance of the big top with his tongue hanging out and his pupils shaped like hearts then stops
Polly the dog s trainer sees Snoopy and pulls him inside
The next day Peppermint Patty calls Charlie Brown to tell him her school gave all students the day off to see the circus
Charlie Brown tells her that his school will be closed as well and they decide to attend the circus together
At the circus the children see Snoopy perform as part of a dog act
They all realize it is Snoopy and eventually relish his new career despite Snoopy s shortcomings being completely untrained
However Charlie Brown isn t having any of it exclaiming Snoopy s career is being his dog
Later that night Charlie Brown realizes Snoopy has not returned
He goes to the circus site in time to see Snoopy enter a boxcar still following Fifi
The gate of the boxcar slams shut on him and the circus train pulls away
The next scene involves Snoopy trying to find a good warm place to fall asleep while the train is in motion
First he tries to lie on the humps of a camel only to slide off in between both humps each time then he finds a lion lying on the ground with its mane spread out on the floor
Snoopy finds this warm enough to settle into and does but his comfort is short lived when the lion wakes up and while it does no harm to Snoopy he gets scared off running over the top of a bear then finds himself in another boxcar filled with props
He decided to lie on top of one box which turns out to be the saw a person in half magic trick
He falls into that box and his head and feet appear out the holes in each end
Polly slowly trains Snoopy to become part of the act
First he is given the name Hugo The Great then he is taught to ride a unicycle first on the ground then on the high wire
Snoopy also learns to do a back flip and his performance in the next show is an improvement
Meanwhile back home Lucy has decided to board up the doorway of Snoopy s doghouse and place a sign on it which reads Premises Condemned
Charlie Brown also recounts to Linus the story of why his parents gave him a pet dog
Polly decides to expand the act by getting Snoopy and Fifi to do a trapeze act
Snoopy takes to the air a little more fearlessly Fifi is initially scared
Eventually it works out and at the next show combined with the back flips and the unicycle ride they are a major success
After the show Polly gives Snoopy and Fifi the good news that they are officially the stars of the circus
However her boss feels their colors do not fit and wants them both dyed pink
She first wrestles Snoopy into a large vat of food coloring and after he is completely pink she goes to do the same to Fifi but Snoopy jumps between them growling menacingly at her
After Polly shows no fear and tells him basically to get out of her way Snoopy attacks her and wrestles her into the food coloring until she too is all pink then jumps out and runs away taking Fifi with him to the bus stop to return home but Fifi decides to go back to the circus then Snoopy sadly boards the bus and returns to Charlie Brown
Back home Charlie Brown is awakened by the shower running because Snoopy is washing the pink food coloring off him
Charlie Brown sees him exiting the bathroom but says nothing
Snoopy then makes himself some dinner still crying over being heartbroken from Fifi
Then he realizes that the circus is her life and his home is his life and he retreats to his doghouse
Upon seeing what Lucy did to it he rips up the sign and tears the boards off the house
He goes to bed after illuminating a big blinking neon sign which reads Hugo The Great

The expansion s name refers to the return of the Burning Legion a vast army of demons being one of the main antagonist forces in the Warcraft universe and whose last invasion was defeated in Warcraft III Reign of Chaos
This legion and its allies are the main enemy which players will fight against in The Burning Crusade
In addition to some new areas on Azeroth this expansion mainly features the ravaged world of Outland which the Burning Legion and other powerful beings control
The Doom Lord Kazzak reopened the Dark Portal to Outland flooding Azeroth with the ravenous demons of the Burning Legion
Expeditions from the Horde and Alliance reinforced by their new blood elf and draenei allies passed through the gateway to stop the invasion at its source
On Outland s desiccated Hellfire Peninsula the Alliance discovered several of their heroes who had crossed through the portal many years before while the Horde made contact with the Mag har uncorrupted orcs who had not participated in their race s original invasion of Azeroth
The expedition into Outland dragged Horde and Alliance armies further into conflict with the agents of the Legion and the lieutenants of Illidan Stormrage who had claimed the shattered realm for his own
The Black Temple In his quest to reign over all of Outland Illidan the Betrayer had established a mighty stronghold for his forces within the Black Temple a former draenei citadel
Yet his influence began to wane after the defeat of his most trusted lieutenants including the traitorous former leader of the blood elves Kael thas Sunstrider
The resulting window of opportunity permitted Akama an elder sage of devolved draenei known as the Broken to rebel against the self styled Lord of Outland
Along with Illidan s former jailor the stoic night elf Maiev Shadowsong Akama helped a group of heroes infiltrate Illidan s seat of power and put an end to the Betrayer s reign once and for all
The Gods of Zul Aman Following years of battles alongside the old Horde the troll warlord Zul jin retired to the city of Zul Aman capital of the Amani trolls where he called upon mysterious dark powers to rebuild his army
While the eyes of Azeroth focused on the fight against the Burning Legion and the expedition to Outland treasure seekers invaded Zul Aman rekindling Zul jin s hatred of the outside world particularly the high elves of Quel Thalas
Upon hearing that these newly christened blood elves had become part of the Horde in his absence the infuriated Zul jin declared war on both Horde and Alliance
To gain the upper hand Zul jin attempts to awaken ancient animal gods to harness their power but is slain by a group of heroes before his plans can come to fruition
Fury of the Sunwell Fresh from his defeat in Outland Kael thas Sunstrider returned to the blood elf city of Silvermoon
Rather than lead his people to glory as he had promised the disgraced prince betrayed them
Kael thas plotted to use the legendary Sunwell source of the blood elves magical power to summon the demon lord Kil jaeden into Azeroth
Aided by a joint task force of blood elves and draenei the Shattered Sun Offensive Horde and Alliance heroes with the help of a dragon Kalecgos and the Sunwell s mortal form Anveena narrowly stopped both Kael thas and Kil jaeden though Anveena sacrifices herself in the process
The draenei prophet Velen then uses the naaru M uru s energy to reignite and purify the Sunwell

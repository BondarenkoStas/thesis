Backstory In 2072 after the Citadel Station s demise TriOptimum s attempts to cover up the incident were exposed to the media and the corporation was brought up on charges from multiple individuals and companies for the ensuing scandal
The virus developed there killed the station s population the ruthless malevolent A I supercomputer named SHODAN controlled and eventually destroyed the Citadel Station in hopes of enslaving and destroying humanity
After a massive number of trials the company went bankrupt and their operations were shut down
The United Nations Nominate a UN successor was established to combat the malevolence and corruption of power hungry corporations including TriOptimum
Artificial intelligence was reduced to most rudimentary tasks in order to prevent the creation of another SHODAN like malevolent AI and development of new technologies was halted
Meanwhile the hacker who became the most famous person in the world vanished from public eye
In 2100 28 years later the company s failed stocks and assets were bought by a Russian oligarch named Anatoly Korenchkin a former black market operator who sought to make money in legitimate ways
He re licensed and restored the company to its former status in the following decade
Along with producing healthcare and consumer products Korenchkin signed weapons contracts with various military organizations private and political owned
The new UNN was almost virtually powerless with Korenchkin exercising control over them
In January 2114 42 years after the Citadel events and 12 years into rebuilding TriOptimum the company created an experimental FTL starship the Von Braun which is now on its maiden voyage
The ship is also followed by a UNN space vessel the Rickenbacker which is controlled by Captain William Bedford Diego son of Edward Diego the Citadel Station s infamous commander and public hero of the Battle of the Boston Harbor during the Eastern States Police Action
Because the Rickenbacker does not have an FTL system of its own the two ships are attached for the trip
However Korenchkin was egotistical enough to make himself the captain of the Von Braun despite being inexperienced
In July 2114 5 months into the journey the ships respond to a distress signal from the planet Tau Ceti V outside the Solar System
A rescue team is sent to the planet s surface where they discover strange eggs these eggs found in an old ejection pod infect the rescue team and integrate them into an alien communion known as the Many a psychic hive mind generated by parasitic worms which can infect and mutate a human host
The parasites eventually spread to both ships and take over or kill most of their crews
Plot Owing to a computer malfunction the remaining soldier awakens with amnesia in a cryo tube on the medical deck of the Von Braun being implanted with an illegal cyber neural interface
He is immediately contacted by another survivor Dr Janice Polito who guides him to safety before the cabin depressurizes
She demands that he meets her on deck 4 of the Von Braun
Along the way the soldier battles the infected crew members
The Many also telepathically communicate with him attempting to convince him to join them
After restarting the ship s engine core the soldier reaches deck 4 and discovers that Polito is dead
He is then confronted by SHODAN
It is revealed she has been posing as Polito to gain the soldier s trust
SHODAN mentions that she is responsible for creating the Many through her bioengineering experiments on Citadel Station
The Hacker who created her ejected the grove that contained her experiments to prevent them contaminating Earth an act that allowed part of SHODAN to survive in the grove
The grove crash landed on Tau Ceti V While SHODAN went into forced hibernation The Many evolved beyond her control
SHODAN tells the soldier that his only chance for survival lies in helping destroy her creations
Efforts to regain control of XERXES the main computer on the Von Braun fail
SHODAN informs the soldier that destroying the ship is their only option but he must transmit her program to the Rickenbacker first
While en route the soldier briefly encounters two survivors Thomas Tommy Suarez and Rebecca Siddons who flee the ship aboard an escape pod
With the transfer complete the soldier travels to the Rickenbacker and learns both ships have been enveloped by the infection s source a gigantic mass of bio organic tissue that has wrapped itself over the two ships
The soldier enters the biomass and destroys its core stopping the infection
SHODAN congratulates him and tells of her intentions to merge real space and cyberspace through the Von Braun s faster than light drive
The soldier confronts SHODAN in cyberspace and defeats her
The final scene shows Tommy and Rebecca receiving a message from the Von Braun
Tommy responds saying they will return and noting that Rebecca is acting strange
Rebecca is shown speaking in a SHODAN like voice asking Tommy if he likes her new look as the screen fades to black

Tensions are running high in the United States
The recently deceased are returning to life as shambling flesh eating ghouls and political dissidents are threatening social stability
In the city of Philadelphia Fran an employee of WGON TV and Radio learns that her program director Givens is broadcasting out of date information about rescue stations that have been overrun by the living dead
Fran s boyfriend Stephen who pilots the station s traffic helicopter arrives at the station and tells her that they must escape in order to survive
He plans on stealing the station s helicopter and tells Fran to meet him on the roof at 9pm Meanwhile in another part of Philadelphia the city s SWAT team is preparing to launch an assault on a low income tenement building filled with refugees who refuse to leave their homes for emergency shelters they also refuse to give up their dead both deceased and re animated harboring them in the basement of the tenement
After gun battle with armed bandits on the roof the police and National Guard soldiers break into the building using tear gas
Roger one of the SWAT troopers becomes disgusted by the bloodthirsty behavior of some of their fellow SWAT members when one of them goes crazy and begins shooting at both zombies and innocent bystanders
A tall figure in a gas mask shoots the rogue officer dead
Roger retreats to the basement to escape the confusion but the tall figure follows him
He removes his mask and reveals himself to be an imposing man named Peter
They have talk for a few minutes and agree that the zombie plague will only get worse
Roger tells Peter about his friend who has a helicopter he plans to leave with Stephen and Fran and suggests Peter join their escape
A priest emerges from a room in the cellar the man is missing a leg and walks with a crutch
He tells them that he has administered the last rites to the dead people in the next room and that the soldiers may now do what they will with them
Peter and Roger kill all the zombies in the cellar the gravity of the situation nearly overcoming them Meanwhile Stephen and Fran arrive in their helicopter at an abandoned police station pier on the Delaware River to refuel and wait for Roger to show up
They are surprised when four rogue policemen arrive and threaten them for looting the place
Roger and Peter arrive and the rogue cops back down allowing the four to go on their way
Stephen and Fran are surprised that Roger has brought someone with him but they agree to take Peter with them
The four of them fly all night In the morning Stephen lands the helicopter at a small deserted rural airport depot to refuel
While exploring the area zombies attack them from out of nowhere
Stephen tries to prove his manliness before Fran who is carrying his child but he is both clumsy and a poor shot
Roger has to kill the zombies Stephen weakly shoots at and Stephen nearly kills Peter when aiming for a zombie Later while in the air again they see a deserted shopping mall
They land on its roof and break in through a skylight to rest and to collect supplies
The place is full of zombies milling about inside drawn to a place that had meant so much to them when they were alive
Despite the growing number of undead outside the four refugees realize that they could survive there for a long time
It even has a gun shop so they will be able to find weapons to defend themselves
Using the mall s floor plans and master keys Peter Roger and Stephen race around the mall collecting the supplies they will need to make a home
They take these supplies to an upstairs area where they and Fran build a home in an annex of former offices and storage rooms
Fran is resistant to the idea she thinks it is a bad idea to leave what is left of society but perhaps because she is pregnant and wants to do what s best for her child she stays They realize they need to rid the mall of zombies
A decision is made to block the entrances to the mall with semi trucks from a nearby warehouse
While Stephen watches from his circling helicopter Peter and Roger hotwire the trucks and drive them to the mall
Peter is disturbed that Roger seems to be losing his grip on reality he becomes arrogant and takes unnecessary risks in order to demonstrate his mastery of the situation
Unfortunately he is bitten by zombies while trying to get into one of the trucks
They all realize that Roger s wound will prove fatal as nobody can survive a bite for more than a few days
Fran is conflicted she wants to take Roger to a medical facility but the others won t hear of it
They are convinced Roger is doomed but decide to let the disease run it s course Over the next several days they begin to make the mall their home
They care for the ailing Roger as best they can but his condition rapidly deteriorates until it is clear he is on the verge of death
Peter builds a fake wall in front of the only hallway that leads to their home disguising it from any potential looters that may come through the area
They monitor a television to see if the zombie crisis ever ends but the news is dismal
Roger makes Peter promise to kill him if he comes back as a zombie because he tells Peter he s going to try not to return
Roger does return however and Peter is forced to shoot his animated corpse in the head
They bury Roger inside of a large planter that houses decorative palm trees inside the mall One night Peter prepares a romantic dinner for Fran and Stephen
When Peter leaves them alone Stephen proposes marriage to Fran
Fran declines saying that they can t make that kind of commitment given what has become of the world
It wouldn t be real she explains Eventually all television transmissions cease
The remaining three bicker as their sense of isolation gets stronger
Fran demands to learn how to fly the helicopter in case anything were to happen to Stephen
But when he teaches her how to fly it they are spotted by a gang of motorcycle riding survivalists That evening the survivalists looters approach coveting the supplies inside the mall
They try to contact Peter Fran and Stephen by radio but Peter is smart enough not to respond
He knows that they will be killed if the survivalists find them
His plan is to let the looters break in and take what they want then leave betting that they won t find the camouflaged entrance to their home
The looters break into the mall and zombies flood in with them
Stephen believing that the mall belongs to him and his friends sneaks into the mall and tries to shoot the bikers who return fire
With no choice but to help his friend Peter creeps through air shafts picking off isolated bikers and zombies
Unable to cope with both Peter and the zombies the bikers decide to leave
Before they do two of them enter the elevator where Stephen is hiding on top and begin blindly shooting severely wounding him
He is later attacked and bitten by zombies and dies in the elevator
In the mall the zombies corner and eviscerate several of the remaining looters Peter returns to the hidden fortress and waits with Fran they are unsure if Stephen has survived but they know he will return either way
Now a zombie Stephen remembers how to get through the hidden wall to the storeroom
He leads the horde of zombies up the stairwell
When Stephen appears Peter kills him
He tells Fran to leave but he refuses to go with her
He helps Fran onto the roof where she prepares the helicopter
Peter stays in the storeroom waiting for the zombies to flock in and planning to shoot himself before they can grab him
But at the last minute he decides he wants to live and fights his way through the zombies to the helicopter
Fran delayed taking off until the last possible moment and Peter is able to hop into the helicopter
The two fly off to an uncertain future with little fuel left

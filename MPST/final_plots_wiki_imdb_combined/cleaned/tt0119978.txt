Rudy Baylor was brought up in a slum
His father who was a severe alcoholic abused him and his mother
After studying at Austin Peay State University Rudy who has an interest in social justice and civil rights decides to attend law school
When he graduates from the University of Memphis State Law School he unlike most of his fellow grads has no high paying employment lined up
He is forced to apply for part time positions while he serves drinks at a Memphis bar
Desperate for a job he reluctantly goes to an interview with J Lyman Bruiser Stone a ruthless and corrupt but successful personal injury lawyer who makes him an associate
To earn his fee Rudy is turned into an ambulance chaser required to hunt for potential clients at a local hospital
Soon he meets Deck Shifflet a less than ethical former insurance assessor turned paralegal who has gone to law school but failed the bar exam six times
Deck is resourceful in gathering information and practically an expert on insurance lawsuits
Rudy manages to get just one case concerning insurance bad faith
It may be worth several million dollars in damages which appeals to him because he is about to declare himself bankrupt
He rents an apartment above the garage in the home of elderly Miss Birdsong a client whose will he has been drafting
Bruiser is suspected of racketeering and his offices are raided by the police and FBI
Not knowing what else to do Rudy and Deck set up without so much as a secretary for help a two man practice
They file a bad faith suit on behalf of a middle aged couple Dot and Buddy Black whose 22 year old son Donny Ray is going to die from leukemia
Donny Ray would most likely have been saved by a bone marrow transplant had his medical claim not been denied by Great Benefit the family s insurance carrier
Although Rudy passes the Tennessee bar exam he has never argued a case before a judge and jury
He finds himself up against a group of experienced and devious lawyers from a large firm that is headed by Leo F Drummond a showman attorney who uses unscrupulous tactics to win his cases
The original judge assigned to the case Harvey Hale is set to dismiss it because he sees it as one of many so called lottery cases that slow the judicial process
But after Hale suffers a fatal heart attack a far more sympathetic judge Tyrone Kipler takes over the case
Kipler a former civil rights attorney immediately denies the insurance company s petition for dismissal
While preparing his case Rudy gets to know a young woman whom he met at the hospital Kelly Riker a battered wife whose husband Cliff has beaten her so savagely with a baseball bat that she must be hospitalized
After a particularly violent attack Rudy persuades Kelly to whom he is attracted to file for divorce
Going to Kelly s home to pack her belongings Rudy and Kelly are violently confronted by a bat wielding Cliff
After Cliff injures Rudy then pulls a gun on him Rudy grabs the bat and incapacitates him
Kelly insists Rudy leave then finishes Cliff with the baseball bat
To prevent Rudy from being implicated Kelly tells the police she was alone and killed her husband in self defense
Rudy promises to defend Kelly if the case goes to trial but the district attorney declines to prosecute knowing Kelly would never be convicted
Donny Ray dies but not before giving a video deposition
The case goes to trial where Drummond capitalizes on Rudy s inexperience
He gets vital testimony by Rudy s key witness former Great Benefit employee Jackie Lemanczyk stricken from the record and attempts to discredit Donny Ray s mother
Due to Rudy s single minded determination and skillful cross examination of Great Benefit s unctuous president Wilfred Keeley the jury finds for the plaintiff with a monetary award far exceeding all expectations
It is a great triumph for Rudy and Deck at least until Keeley attempts to flee the country after looting the company and Great Benefit declares itself bankrupt making it unable to pay the Blacks or any other claimant
Despite no payout for the grieving parents nor fees for Rudy or Deck Dot Black is relieved that Great Benefit is out of business and unable to hurt other families like hers
Drummond who also will not be getting paid for his services calls up and commiserates with Rudy telling him that everybody lost
Convinced his success will create unrealistic expectations for future clients Rudy abandons his practice to instead teach law with a focus on ethical behavior
He leaves town with Kelly wanting to retain a low profile and protect Kelly from any possible retribution by Cliff s vengeful relatives
He leaves the legal profession after just one successful case

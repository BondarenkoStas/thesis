Barbara and Adam Maitland decide to spend their vacation decorating their idyllic Connecticut country home
As the two are driving home from a trip to town Barbara swerves to avoid a dog and the car plunges into a river
After they return home she and Adam notice that they now lack reflections and they discover a Handbook for the Recently Deceased
They then begin to suspect that they did not survive the car accident Adam attempts to leave the house but finds himself in a strange otherworldly landscape covered in sand and populated by enormous sandworms
The house is sold and the new owners the Deetz family arrive from New York City
Charles Deetz is a former real estate developer his second wife Delia is a self proclaimed sculptor and his goth daughter Lydia from his first marriage is an aspiring photographer
Under the guidance of interior designer Otho the Deetzes transform the house into tasteless pastel toned modern art
Consulting the Handbook the Maitlands travel to an otherworldly waiting room populated by other distressed souls where they discover that the afterlife is structured according to a complex bureaucracy involving vouchers and caseworkers
The Maitlands own caseworker Juno informs them that they must remain in the house for 125 years on pain of a dire fate
If they want the Deetzes out of the house it is up to them to scare them away
Barbara s and Adam s attempts at scaring the family prove ineffective despite their ability to shape shift into monsters
Although Adam and Barbara remain invisible to Charles and Delia teenage Lydia can see the ghost couple and befriends them
Against Juno s advice the Maitlands contact the miscreant Betelgeuse Juno s former assistant and now freelance bio exorcist ghost to scare away the Deetzes
At first they are unaware that Betelgeuse is pronounced Beetlejuice which is why they have such difficulty pronouncing his name and thereby summoning him
However Betelgeuse quickly offends the Maitlands with his crude and morbid demeanor and they reconsider hiring him though too late to stop him from wreaking havoc on the Deetzes
The small town s charm and the supernatural events inspire Charles to pitch his boss Maxie Dean on transforming the town into a tourist hot spot but Maxie wants proof of the ghosts
Using the Handbook for the Recently Deceased Otho conducts what he thinks is a s√©ance and summons Adam and Barbara but they begin to decay and die as Otho had unwittingly performed an exorcism instead
Horrified Lydia summons Betelgeuse for help but he agrees to help her only on the condition that she marry him enabling him to freely cause chaos in the mortal world
Betelgeuse saves the Maitlands and disposes of Maxie his wife and Otho then prepares a wedding before a ghastly minister
The Maitlands intervene before the ceremony is completed with Barbara riding a sandworm through the house to devour Betelgeuse
Finally the Deetzes and Maitlands agree to live in harmony within the house
Betelgeuse is stuck in the afterlife waiting room there he attempts to cut in front of a witch doctor who shrinks his head in retaliation
Being Betelgeuse however he remains upbeat This could be a good look for me
Meanwhile Adam Barbara and Lydia are seen in the front room of the house dancing to Harry Belafonte s Jump In The Line to celebrate Lydia getting an A on her math test at school

Kurt Kuenne and Andrew Bagby grew up as close friends in the suburbs of San Jose California and Bagby frequently appeared in Kuenne s home movies
As these movies became more professional in quality in later years Bagby invested in them with money he had saved up for medical school
While studying in Newfoundland Canada Bagby began a relationship with Shirley Turner a twice divorced general practitioner thirteen years his senior
Bagby s parents friends and associates were uneasy about the relationship because of what they saw as Turner s off putting behavior
Turner moved to Council Bluffs Iowa while Bagby worked as a resident in family practice in Latrobe Pennsylvania
In November 2001 as the relationship began to crumble Turner became increasingly possessive
Bagby broke up with her and put her on a plane to Iowa
Turner drove almost 1 000 miles back to Pennsylvania overnight and asked Bagby to meet her at Keystone State Park
Bagby was found dead the following day face down with five gunshot wounds
When Turner learned she was a suspect in the murder investigation she fled to St John s Newfoundland
As the legal drama unfolded Kuenne began collecting footage from his old home movies and interviewed Bagby s parents David and Kathleen for a documentary about his life
After she reached St John s Shirley Turner revealed that she was pregnant with Bagby s child
While her extradition was pending Turner was not held in custody she gave birth to a boy she named Zachary
Bagby s parents moved to Canada to gain custody of Zachary and to obtain Turner s rendition for a trial in the U S
However the extradition process was repeatedly prolonged by Turner s lawyers based on legal technicalities
When a provincial court ruled that enough evidence pointed to Turner as Bagby s killer she was put in jail and Bagby s parents David and Kathleen were awarded custody of Zachary
Meanwhile Kuenne traveled across the U S and the United Kingdom to interview Bagby s friends and extended family
Kuenne also went to Newfoundland and visited Zachary in July 2003
In jail Turner wrote to a judge and contrary to normal legal procedure received advice on how to appeal her arrest and imprisonment
Turner was later released by a Newfoundland judge Gale Welsh who despite what the film presents as ample evidence that Turner was psychologically disturbed felt she did not pose a threat to society in general
Turner was therefore released on bail and successfully sued for joint custody of Zachary with the Bagbys although their arrangement was tenuous
The arrangement ended in tragedy when on August 18 2003 Turner jumped into the Atlantic Ocean with thirteen month old Zachary in a murder suicide
David and Kathleen were left dumbfounded and grief stricken
Kuenne s attempts to arrange interviews with the prosecutors and judges who facilitated Turner s freedom were rebuffed
Distraught over Zachary s death and outraged at the Canadian legal system s failure to protect the child David and Kathleen mounted a campaign to reform the country s bail laws which they believed had helped allow Turner to kill her child and herself
A panel convened by Newfoundland s Ministry of Justice agreed releasing a report stating that Zachary s death had been preventable and that the government s handling of Turner s case had been inadequate
Turner s psychiatrist was found guilty of misconduct for having helped her post bail and the director of Newfoundland s child welfare agency resigned
David Bagby wrote a best selling book about his family s ordeal during the saga
Kuenne finished his documentary and dedicated it to the memory of both Bagby and his son the film ends with the Bagbys and their relatives friends and colleagues reflecting on the father and son as well as the impact that David and Kate had on all of them

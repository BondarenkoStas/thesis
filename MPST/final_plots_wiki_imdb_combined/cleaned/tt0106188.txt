Barry Thomas is bored with his job and moons over high profile scientist Lisa Fredericks who is working on an particle accelerator that accelerates faster than the speed of light that is about to be shut down over the risks regarding it
On the way home Barry sees Lisa fatally shot and takes it very hard
While at home at midnight he receives a strong electrical shock
The next morning the events of the previous day are repeating themselves and Barry is the only one who realizes that the world is stuck in a time loop
During several repetitions Barry figures out how to save Lisa and get closer to her
His actions also get him fired and arrested for knowing too much about events
Barry and Lisa eventually learn that her boss Dr Thadius Moxley has been conducting illegal and unethical experiments with the faster than light particle accelerator in the hopes of harvesting its extreme cheap energy with the intention of earning a lot of money with it
These experiments caused the time loop
In fact it was Lisa s partial knowledge of Dr Moxley s illegal activities that resulted in her murder by his henchmen
After getting involved with an undercover government agent they must stop her boss from starting his experiment at the end of a loop or the world will be trapped forever repeating the same day
Expanding on the original s premise of a one hour time loop this version saw the main character reliving the same 24 hour period which would restart at one minute past midnight
It also contains a pseudo happy ending as the protagonist ultimately finds a way to correct the time loop over the course of the film s 92 minute running time

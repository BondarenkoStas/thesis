The short opens with a dog with a Russian accent hunting for a rabbit by sniffing a trail
He happens upon Bugs who begins to torment the dog
This prompts a chase which leads to a nearby lake where the rest of the story continues
Most of the action takes place underwater
Eventually after a few gags with Bugs dressed up as a mermaid playing tag with the dog and throwing the dog into a rock leaving his feet sticking out and Bugs disguising himself as Elmer Fudd the dog corners Bugs and demands he gives him a rabbit sandwich
Bugs obliges and the rabbit places himself between two giant slices of loaf bread with his legs curled next to his body
The dog takes a bite and Bugs screams and fakes his death
The dog becomes instantly grief stricken and sobs declaring that he should be the one to die
With this statement Bugs springs back to life asking Ehhhh do you mean it
and obliges the dog s death wish
The dog falls to the ground Bugs plants a flower on his chest and dances away into the distance
As the cartoon is about to iris out the dog sits up holds the iris before it closes and declares This shouldn t even happen to a dog
He then lets the iris go but it closes on his nose in the process making him yelp in pain

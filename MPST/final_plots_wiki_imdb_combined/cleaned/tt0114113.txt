Cuban boat lift refugees land in Miami with different goals
The story focuses on relationships that develop under hard circumstances with long lasting effects
Drama is real story is clean and not predictable
Character development is adequate actor list is 1st class
Good writing
Marisa Tomei is incredible as usual and her character was the most developed but a bit predictable at some points
At times however it feels as though you are seeing the table of contents version only of a great novel
There was so much talent available and so much more character development was expected
Could be editing issues
The politics both national and international were glossed over and made to seem insignificant like another day in the park
The boat lift of political prisioners from Cuba deserved way more development and insight and with the amazing cast it was an oppurtunity lost
The end of the movie provides a twist but not so strange as to be unbelievable but again so much interpersonal drama was available but not included
The acting was excellent considering what the actors were given to develop

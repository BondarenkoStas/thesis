Tony le Stéphanois has served a five year prison term for a jewel heist and is out on the street and down on his luck
His friend Jo approaches him about a smash and grab proposed by mutual friend Mario in which the threesome would cut the glass on a Parisian jeweler s front window in broad daylight and snatch some gems
Tony declines
He then learns that his old girlfriend Mado took up in his absence with gangster Parisian nightclub owner Pierre Grutter
Finding Mado working at Grutter s Tony invites her back to his rundown flat
She is obviously well kept and Tony savagely beats her for being so deeply involved with Grutter
Tony changes his mind about the heist he now accepts on the condition that they rob the jeweler s safe instead of the window
Mario suggests they employ the services of Italian compatriot César a safecracker
The four devise and rehearse an ingenious plan to break into the store and disarm its sophisticated alarm system
The caper begins with the group chiseling through a cement ceiling from an upstairs flat on a Sunday night
The suspenseful break in completed the criminals appear to escape without leaving any trace of their identities
However without the others knowledge César pocketed a diamond ring as a bauble for his lover Viviane a chanteuse at Grutter s club
The four men arrange to fence the loot with a London contact
Meanwhile Grutter has seen Mado and her injuries who breaks off their relationship
Infuriated at Tony s interference in his life he gives heroin to his drug addicted brother Rémy and tells him to murder Tony
Grutter sees the diamond César gave to Viviane and realizes that César Mario and Tony were responsible for the jewel theft
Grutter forces César to confess
Forsaking a 10 million franc police reward Grutter decides to steal the jewels from Tony s gang his brother Rémy brutally murdering Mario and his wife Ida when they refuse to reveal where the loot is hidden
Tony retrieves it from the couple s apartment and anonymously pays for a splendid funeral for them
He then goes looking for Grutter and stumbles onto the captive César who confesses having squealed
Citing the rules Tony ruefully kills him
Meanwhile seeking to force their adversaries hand Grutter s thugs kidnap Jo s five year old son Tonio and hold him ransom
The London fence arrives with the payoff after which Tony leaves to single handedly rescue the child by force advising Jo it is the only way they will see him alive
With Mado s help he tracks Tonio down at Grutter s country house and kills Grutter s brothers Rémy and Louis while rescuing him
On the way back to Paris Tony learns Jo has cracked under the pressure and agreed to meet Grutter at his house with the money
When he arrives Grutter tells him Tony has already snatched the child and kills Jo
Seconds too late to save his friend Tony is mortally wounded by Grutter before killing him as he tries to flee with the loot
Bleeding profusely Tony drives maniacally back to Paris and delivers Tonio home safely before dying at the wheel as police and bystanders close in on him and a suitcase filled with 120 million francs in cash

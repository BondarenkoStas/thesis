At a psychiatric hospital former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus is largely recovered from the murderous insanity that saw him repeatedly attempt to kill the thorn in his side Inspector Jacques Clouseau
He is about to be released but Clouseau who is now Chief Inspector and has arrived to speak on Dreyfus s behalf comes to visit and his clumsiness and proneness to accidents drive Dreyfus insane again Soon thereafter Dreyfus escapes from the asylum intent on killing Clouseau who apparently had become a deranged good cop gone bad
His first attempt involves planting a bomb under Clouseau s apartment whilst Clouseau destructively duels with his manservant Cato who is under orders to keep Clouseau alert by randomly attacking him
The bomb merely destroys Clouseau s apartment whilst Clouseau himself is unharmed largely because Clouseau has been distracted by an inflatable costume and a telephone call
Cato ends up in the hospital Using his knowledge of the underworld Dreyfus frees Anthony Tournier a bank robber Clouseau had recently arrested from prison
Other criminals with a grudge against Clouseau flock under their banner
His next step is to kidnap nuclear physicist Professor Hugo Fassbender and the Professor s daughter Margo forcing the professor to build a doomsday weapon in return for his daughter s freedom
Because Hugo Fassbender fears to have his daughter harmed he agrees Clouseau travels to England to investigate Fassbender s disappearance with typically chaotic results as Scotland Yard Section Director Alec Drummond and Superintendent Quinlan painfully learn
Meanwhile Dreyfus broadcasts himself to the world to announce his ultimatum destroy Clouseau or he will destroy mankind
Disintegrating the United Nations headquarters in New York City before the disbelieving eyes of the world he blackmails the leaders of the world including the President of the United States into assassinating Clouseau Forced to take Dreyfus s threat seriously several nations send assassins to kill Clouseau at the Oktoberfest in Germany
Many of the nations however instruct their assassins to kill other assassins if necessary in order to win Dreyfus s favor and possibly get hold of the Doomsday Machine
This combined with Clouseau s typical bumbling fashion enables Clouseau to evade each assassination attempt just as it is about to happen so that the assassins all kill each other instead
The assassins of 26 nations are killed in the attempt so that the only survivors are the Egyptian and a Soviet Union operative
The Egyptian assassin sneaking into Clouseau s hotel room shoots a man he believes to be Clouseau
The Russian operative Olga Bariosova who has sneaked into Clouseau s room seduces the Egyptian similarly mistaking him for Clouseau
His passionate sexuality convinces her not to assassinate him when the real Clouseau makes an appearance he is surprised to discover a beautiful woman in his bed who confuses him further by declaring her undying passion for him and by finding a dead man in his bath
A tattoo on Tournier combined with Olga s dismissively revealed knowledge reveals to Clouseau Dreyfus s location at a castle in Bavaria Germany Dreyfus is elated at Clouseau s apparent demise but his joy is soured by a bad case of toothache
Clouseau who has arrived in the village near Dreyfus s castle and has unsuccessfully attempted to breach the castle thwarted every time by a drawbridge that appears to be mocking him eventually infiltrates Dreyfus s castle hideout disguised as a dentist intoxicates Dreyfus with nitrous oxide and pulls one of Dreyfus s healthy teeth
Realizing the deception and laughing hysterically Dreyfus orders Clouseau killed but Clouseau escapes Enraged Dreyfus means to seek vengeance on the world by destroying England as he prepares for this Clouseau who has been thrown into the castle s barnyard is literally catapulted onto Dreyfus s doomsday machine
Clouseau s weight redirects the disintegrator so that the beam hits Dreyfus and Dreyfus s castle
As Dreyfus s henchmen Fassbender and his daughter and eventually Clouseau himself escape the dissolving castle Dreyfus himself plays Tiptoe Through the Tulips on the castle s pipe organ laughing insanely and gradually disintegrating
The castle then disappears entirely taking Dreyfus with it and destroying him once and for all Returning to Paris Clouseau is reunited with Olga who has dismissed Cato for the evening and intends on completing her seduction of Clouseau
This is interrupted first by Clouseau s apparent inability to remove his clothes without a struggle and then by Cato who chooses this time to once more follow his orders and attack Clouseau and Olga
The consequent struggle ends when all three are hurled by a reclining bed into the Seine
Immediately thereafter a cartoon image of Clouseau emerges from the water which has been tinted pink and begins swimming unaware that a gigantic version of the Pink Panther character is waiting below him with a sharp toothed open mouth
The film ends when the animated Clouseau gets chased by the shark in the water as the credits roll

Eric Poole is a convicted teenage serial killer
Lorelei Lori Cranston is a troubled 15 year old girl
As a little boy in New England Eric Poole already exhibited symptoms of a sociopath
He was suspected of murdering several young girls but also murdered his mother and stepfather and was convicted for those deaths
He convinced investigators that he killed his guardians out of self defense with a false story of abuse
Lori is described as a beautiful girl with a very mature body at a young age
Consequently she must constantly deal with the wanted and unwanted sexual attention she receives from men
She has a tendency to fixate of men and will pursue them until she has put her mouth on theirs
Detective Jake Proctor always suspected that Eric was guilty of killing the other girls and had fabricated the abuse story
He is determined to prove that Eric is a serial killer
At 18 Eric is released from the juvenile detention center he has been held in and immediately starts looking for a new victim
Lori sees him on TV fixates on him and runs away from home to find him while Detective Proctor begins setting a trap to catch Eric before he can kill again

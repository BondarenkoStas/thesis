The game picks up where Escape from Butcher Bay left off
Richard B Riddick is a dangerous space criminal who can see in the dark
Johns the man who originally took Riddick to the Butcher Bay prison for a bounty helped him escape to avoid becoming a prisoner himself
On their ship together in a cryogenic sleep they are dragged unwillingly into the Dark Athena a gigantic mercenary vessel run by Gale Revas and her second in command Spinner
Riddick avoids capture as Revas and her men take Johns away
Using the same stealth tactics as he did in Butcher Bay Riddick sneaks and hides throughout the ship seeking to escape killing the guards and mercenaries he encounters along the way
Many of the guards are automated drones that are human bodies with implanted machine parts controlled remotely from within the ship
He meets with a little girl named Lynn who is hiding from the guards in the air vent systems
Riddick makes his way to the prison cells and finds several people captured including the former Captain of the Dark Athena before Revas took control
There he meets Lynn s mother Ellen Silverman
She offers to make Riddick the tools he needs to escape through the air vents if he can get the right parts
She also asks to find Lynn because she is concerned for her safety
Another prisoner named Dacher offers his technical skills to help Riddick escape on a ship and unlock doors for him if Riddick can find him a com link
He agrees and finds the com link for Dacher and the parts for Silverman
Having again met with Lynn Silverman keeps her word and makes him the tool he needs
Riddick moves on and is in contact with Dacher via video communication at computer terminals on the ship
Riddick frees the prisoners but most are killed including Lynn s mother Silverman
Revas kills Dacher as he prepares the ship for their escape
Riddick finally meets Revas face to face
As they fight he wounds her severely and she is thought to be dead
As he is preparing an escape pod to take off Lynn is pounding on the door begging to take her with him
Revas who is still alive as Riddick s pod takes off fires a missile that hits the pod causing it to crash on the planet Aguerra Prime below
Riddick wakes up on the shore of a beach and he makes his way into an abandoned city
The planet is under siege from Revas troops who are capturing civilians and harvesting their bodies to use for their drones
Riddick realizes his only way off the planet is to get back on the Dark Athena again
He makes his way through the city and back to the port where the Athena is docked
Spinner attacks Riddick in a robotic mech suit but is defeated
He gets back onto the Dark Athena and meets Lynn again
She tells Riddick her mother taught her how to make the drones turn on Revas crew and attack them instead
Fighting ensues on the ship between the drones and the mercenaries
He makes his way up the ship and Riddick meets with Revas again who is in a suit of armor with heavy weapons
He defeats her by pushing her into an elevator shaft and she falls to her death
Lynn meets up with him and they are seen going into the elevator
She asks him if Revas is coming back and Riddick answers When I say goodbye it s forever
Then the credits roll

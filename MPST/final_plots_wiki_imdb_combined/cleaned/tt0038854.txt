Frank Chambers is a hobo who stops at a rural diner for a meal and ends up working there
The diner is operated by a beautiful young woman Cora Smith and her much older husband Nick
Frank and Cora start to have an affair soon after they meet
Cora is tired of her situation married to a man she does not love and working at a diner that she wishes to own
She and Frank scheme to murder Nick in order to start a new life together without her losing the diner
Their first attempt at the murder is a failure but they eventually succeed
The local prosecutor Kyle Sackett has deduced what really occurred but does not have enough evidence to prove it
As a tactic intended to get Cora and Frank to turn on each other he files murder charges against only Cora
Although they turn against each other a clever ploy from Cora s lawyer prevents Cora s full confession from coming into the hands of the prosecutor
With the tactic having failed to generate any new evidence for the prosecution Cora benefits from a plea bargain in which she pleads guilty to manslaughter and receives probation
Frank and Cora eventually patch together their relationship and plan for a future together but as they seem to be prepared to live happily ever after Cora dies in a car crash while Frank is driving
Although it was truly an accident the circumstances seem suspicious enough that Frank is accused of having staged the crash
He is convicted of murdering Cora and is sentenced to death
When informed that his last chance at a reprieve from his death sentence has been denied and thus his execution is now at hand Frank is at first incredulous that he will be put to death for a crime of which he is innocent
However when informed that authorities have recently discovered irrefutable evidence of his guilt in the murder of Nick Frank decides that his impending death is actually his overdue punishment for that crime
Frank contemplates that when a person is expecting to receive a letter it is of no concern if at first he does not hear the postman ring the doorbell because the postman will always ring a second time and the second ring will invariably be heard
After they escaped legal punishment for Nick s murder but with Cora now dead and Frank on his way to the death chamber he notes that the postman has indeed rung a second time for each of them

The film portrays the 1996 Mount Everest disaster and the events that preceded it
The film mainly follows Jon Krakauer the author of the book on which the film is based it also follows the climbing teams of summit guides Rob Hall and Scott Fischer
The film begins with Krakauer giving a monologue about the events about the disaster
The guides Rob Hall and Scott Fischer introduce themselves their teams and discuss with the clients how they intend to reach the summit by the set date
Hall s group contains Doug Hansen a mailman from Seattle Krakauer Yasako Namba and several others
Fischer s group contains a New York socialite Sandy Pittman who will perform what Krakauer does for Hall s group reporting and bring attention
At base camp Hall speaks with his pregnant wife Jan in New Zealand about potential names for their daughter
The groups slowly make their way through camps 2 3 and 4 and then begin their ascent for the summit
However in camp 2 Fischer is forced to go all the way back down so he can take a sick client Dale Cruz down for help
Scott refuses help and returns exhausted and out of breath
The ascent begins well with both groups making steady pace
However upon reaching the bottom of the Hillary step they realize that there are no fixed ropes
The Sherpa there states it s a two person job and the other Sherpa never arrived mostly due to being too tired and sick from dragging Pittman and all of her heavy equipment all the way up
Mountain Madness guides Anatoli Boukreev and Neil Beidelman set the fixed ropes but by then dozens of climbers had already reached the step and now a large jam is at the bottom
Krakauer continues up and reaches the summit with Anatoli Boukreev where shortly afterward they are joined by Adventure Consultants guide Andy Harris
Krakauer begins his descent but reaches the step only the find the jam has only gotten worse and is forced to wait it out
Meanwhile Hall is forced to tell client Doug Hansen that they have to turn around and go back
Hansen refuses as he failed to reach the summit the year before and he knows he won t be able to afford a third attempt
Hall and Hansen argue before Hall finally caves in and they continue missing Hall s 2 00 PM turnaround time
Finally the path down the step clears and Harris begins to descend Krakauer meanwhile begins to hallucinate from a lack of oxygen
Earlier he had asked Harris to decrease his oxygen flow but Harris instead increased it and Krakauer nearly falls over the side but manages to catch himself
He makes his way down the step and to Harris and realizes something is wrong with Harris who thinks the completely full bottles at the oxygen drop are empty
As he descends he runs into Hansen and Hall and points out to Hansen that storm clouds are making their way up through the valley and up the mountain
Shortly after 3 PM the majority of Hall s and Fischer s groups finally reach the summit
As Krakauer continues his descent he runs into Scott Fischer who is completely exhausted and refuses to turn around
Shortly after 4 PM Rob Hall and Doug Hansen finally reach the summit where Hall remarks to Hansen that a storm is coming
As he continues to go down and the weather starts to get bad Krakauer runs into Beck Weathers sitting alone by himself in snow
Weathers had eye surgery performed prior to the trip and has lost vision in his eyes during the summit ascent
He declines to leave with Krakauer explaining he had promised Rob Hall that he would wait for him to go down
At 4 30 Fischer and his Sherpa Lopsang finally reach the summit where Scott feels ill and collapses
Around 5 Krakauer finally reaches the tents at camp 4 where he goes to sleep
The weather continues to worsen and later Beidelman Mike Groom and the majority of both teams clients stop to rest where they run into Beck Weathers who agrees to descend with them
Storm clouds and thick snowfall cause the guides to lose their positions and not know where they need to go
Higher on the mountain Hall and Hansen watch as Scott Fischer is dragged by them so weak he can no longer stand
Night falls and Krakauer is awoken in his tent by Rob s Sherpa Angdorjee who informs him that the storm is getting increasingly worse and that Rob and majority of the clients have yet to return
The pair make an attempt to find them but quickly turn back when they realize the conditions are too treacherous
Meanwhile Rob attempts to convince Doug to stand up and continue descending but Doug begs Rob to leave him telling Rob he will die if he attempts to save him
Rob refuses to leave him behind and they continue
Scott suffering from edema walks off the side of the mountain and is only saved when his Sherpa pulls him back up with their connected short rope
Scott then begins to fall into unconsciousness and Lopsang radios for help
Rob continues to struggle down with Doug
In the darkness Rob slips and falls down and becomes separated from a hallucinating Doug
He then watches helplessly as Doug too far away to help tumbles over the side to his death
Rob is then found by Andy who attempts to help him up
Andy then leaves telling Rob he is going to get help
Despite Rob s plea s Andy continues to go
Andy disappears from view
Rob then hears him cry out and crawls forward to find Andy s hat lying next to a large drop off and assumes that Andy has fallen to his death
Rob buried under snow communicates with Krakauer attempting to get direction on where he can find oxygen
He gets direction but then falls down again and begins to moan
The oxygen bottles are then revealed to be less than twenty feet away from him but he doesn t see them
Beidelman and Groom s group becomes hopelessly lost and they take only the clients who can walk with them dropping Yasuko Beck Sandy Pittman and Charlotte Fox
Scott continues to drift in and out of consciousness only muttering the words I am invincible to his Sherpa before again losing consciousness
Anatoli Boukreev appears and helps down Charlotte Fox and Pittman but is unable to get a third client
Rob begins to hallucinate about seeing his wife Jan but then snaps outs of it to realize he is still stuck
He also begins to realize that his hands and his legs are getting extremely frostbitten and he is having trouble moving
He then blacks out again
Rob then awakens the next morning to realize that he is still alive but barely
He radios the camp who put him onto the radio with his wife Jan
He asks her if Sarah would be an appropriate name for their daughter and she agrees
They both tell each other they love them and then Rob says goodbye to his wife
He dies shortly afterward from hypothermia
Beck Weathers then wakes up somehow having survived being buried under the snow with no oxygen
Still blinded he stumbles back to camp where he receives help
Meanwhile Anatoli climbs up and finds the now frozen corpse of Scott Fischer
He says goodbye and after pulling Fischer s backpack over his face he leaves
Back at base camp the survivors reminisce about the friends that they have lost

Born the same day at the turn of the 20th century Italy January 1 1900 two best friends Alfredo Berlinghieri and Olmo Dalcò come from opposite ends of the social spectrum
Alfredo is from a family of wealthy landowners led by his abusive but populist grandfather Alfredo the Elder while Olmo is an illegitimate peasant son off the estate whose grandfather Leo Dalcò is the foreman and peasant strong man who verbally and spiritually carries a duel of wits with both the peasants as well as his employer but without ever reaching violence with Elder Alfredo s bidding
While growing up the young Alfredo is somewhat rebellious and despises the falseness of his family in particular his weak but cynical father Ottavio he befriends Olmo who was raised as a socialist The two become friends throughout their childhood despite the social differences of their families
Alfredo s grandfather suffering from gout senile dementia and other ailments commits suicide by hanging himself in the dairy barn
As a result Ottavio inherits the plantation In 1917 the teenage Olmo enlists with the Italian army during World War I and goes off to fight on the front lines in northern Italy while Alfredo stays behind to learn how to run his family s large plantation
Olmo returns from the war over a year later and his friendship with Alfredo continues
However during Olmo s time away Alfredo s father has hired Attila Mellanchini as his new foreman following the death of Olmo s own grandfather
Attila is sadistic man who becomes taken with fascism especially after the fascists come to power in the early 1920s Italy Attila eventually incorporates his new belief system in his dealings with the Berlinghieri workers he treats them cruelly and later cages them in the Berlinghieri compound and accuses them of treason against Fascist Italy
Several are killed by Attila himself
Alfredo s father Ottavio eventually dies from an illness and Alfredo inherits the vast estate as its sole heir
As the new padrone of the plantation Alfredo does little to challenge or halt Attila s evil actions During the late 1920s and early 1930s the intimacy and lack thereof in their respective relationships with others is highlighted in their love lives as both Alfredo and Olmo cannot seem to hook up with the right woman to be with
Alfredo eventually marries a gorgeous demure woman named Ada while Olmo marries Anita a fellow idealist who like him shares in the enthusiasm of the cause of workers rights in the vein of socialism
Ada however sinks into alcoholism when confronted with the reality of the emptiness of her relationship with Alfredo Anita dies tragically in childbirth bringing another member into the community a daughter whom Olmo names after his late wife
As Olmo takes on his fateful role of leader among the poor farmers and their families he clashes with Attila several times as the years go on
Olmo s daughter Anita the Younger grows into a young and resourceful teenager whom is supportive of her father s socialist beliefs The power however shifts after World War II in 1945 and the ruling class is at the mercy of the jovial and bitter peasants in the agricultural estate
As padrone Alfredo is captured by a teenage peasant boy carrying a rifle
Attila is also captured when he and his wife the equally cruel and sadistic Regina try to flee the region
Attila is stabbed non fatally several times by women wielding pitchforks and is imprisoned in the Berlinghieri pig sty
He is later executed by the peasants who have discovered that Attila had raped and killed a young boy several years prior in a fit of rage and had also murdered a wealthy landowner s widow Mrs Pioppi whose husband had been economically ruined by Alfredo in order to steal her land and home Alfredo is brought before Olmo s workers tribunal to stand trial
Many workers come forth and accuse Alfredo of letting them suffer in squalor while he profited from their labors and on top of that he did nothing to stop the sadistic Attila
Alfredo is sentenced to death but his execution is prevented after Olmo explains that the padrone is already dead even though Alfredo lives that is the social system has been overthrown with the end of the war
As soon as the verdict overturned however representatives of the new government which includes the Communist Party arrive and call on the peasants to turn in their arms
Olmo convinces the peasants to do so overcoming their skepticism
Alfredo declares to Olmo The padrone is alive

In the pilot episode God appears to Joan and reminds her that she promised to do anything he wanted if he would let her brother survive a car crash that left him a paraplegic
God appears in the form of various people including small children teenage boys elderly ladies transients or passersby
Joan is asked by God to perform tasks that often appear to be trivial or contrary but always end up positively improving a larger situation
One of the more obvious effects of Joan s actions occurs when she is asked to take a reclusive bully to the school dance
While both her mother and the assistant principal object Joan follows through with God s task
At the dance it is revealed that the bully has a bottle of alcohol with him but Joan convinces him not to open it
Despite this the assistant principal later reaches into his jacket finds the alcohol and expels him
In his anger the boy threatens the chief of police with a handgun and he is then arrested
Joan later finds out from God that while this turn of events seems rather bleak it was the lesser of two evils without Joan s actions he would have shot over a dozen students and teachers with a handgun before turning the gun on himself
This ending is noticeably more direct than most episodes since it is the only time God comments so clearly on what would have happened rather than primarily allowing events to speak for themselves
The series starred actors Joe Mantegna and Mary Steenburgen as Joan s parents Will and Helen Jason Ritter as her paraplegic older brother Kevin and Michael Welch as her younger brother Luke
The family relationships and plot situations were written more realistically than other shows with spiritual themes
Various storylines that spanned multiple episodes dealt with the consequences of Kevin s accident Will s job as a police officer Helen s career as an art teacher and Luke s aspirations to be a scientist
God quotes Bob Dylan Emily Dickinson and the Beatles rather than any scripture or verses
Furthermore God is portrayed with a very human personality
In Touch Move he tells Joan that he has to send her down there and laughs when she becomes worried he means Hell when he meant the school basement
Also in one episode he hands Joan a book from a store they have just left
When Joan accuses him of stealing he remarks Well technically everything s mine
Christopher Marquette also stars as Adam Rove a close friend of Joan s who has an on and off romantic relationship with her
Another of Joan s best friends is Grace Polk played by Becky Wahlstrom

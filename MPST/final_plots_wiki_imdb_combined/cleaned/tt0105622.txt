The first two thirds of the film consists in large part of four sex sequences
Two involve dildos and mirrors one with the man dominant one with the female dominant
The other two involve erotic asphyxiation with again one episode in which the man wants to partially asphyxiate a female and the other in which a man is the recipient
Other sexual acts and interests are involved in some of the scenarios
However the actual story revolves around Ai s unrequited love for a married gallery artist who has ended his relationship with her

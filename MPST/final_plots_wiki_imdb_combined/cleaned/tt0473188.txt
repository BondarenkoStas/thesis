Don Huertero is a Mexican drug lord
His daughter committed suicide because a drug dealer known as Bobby Z broke her heart
Consequently Don Huertero is out for vengeance
In trepidation Bobby Z seeks shelter in an American embassy
From there he is handed over to federal agent Tad Gruzsa
In order to get hold of Bobby Z after all Don Huertero takes a colleague of Tad Gruzsa as hostage and proposes an exchange
Bobby Z knows Don Huertero won t rest until he believes him dead
Being worried sick he bribes Tad Gruzsa
Now Tad Gruzsa conceives a plan to deceive Don Huertero
He wants to make Don Huertero believe Bobby Z was dead without harming the real Bobby Z
When the exchange is supposed to take place Tad Gruzsa replaces Bobby Z
In his stead the clueless doppelgänger Tim Kearney crosses the border
During the exchange Tad Gruzsa incites a gunfight and tries to shoot the doppelgänger dead
Even so Tim Kearney scarcely survives
But Tad Gruzsa keeps on trying to kill him
But he fails time after time
Despite all his efforts it is the real Bobby Z who is taken down
Tim Kearney on the other hand finds love

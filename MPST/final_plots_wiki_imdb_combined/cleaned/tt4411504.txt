At the end of the Falklands War in 1982 Arquímedes who had been working for the state s intelligence services in operations to capture communist guerrilla fighters becomes the owner of a small shop a deli
In order to maintain his financial status he decides to turn to crime and start kidnapping people for ransom targeting wealthy families
Alejandro starts to collaborate with his father by identifying potential hostages taking advantage of his popularity among friends and acquaintances to not raise suspicion
The first victim is Ricardo Manoukian a friend and teammate of Alejandro s

After discovering Ricardo has been killed Alejandro has a bout of conscience but his father convinces him to keep the secret by assuring him that if Ricardo had been left alive he would have identified them as the culprits and gotten them all arrested
The ransom improves the Puccios economic situation and by early 1983 they replace their family deli with a successful store selling sporting equipment

Meanwhile Gustavo Contenpomi a friend of Arquímedes who is furious after being deceived in a business deal with entrepreneur Florencio Aulet contacts the Puccios and suggests they make Florencio their next victim

The Aulets pay the ransom but Eduardo has already been murdered and his body buried in a shallow grave on an empty construction lot
In December 1983 after the return to democracy in Argentina Arquímedes goes to visit imprisoned military officer Aníbal Gordon who had participated with Puccio in the kidnapping of a businessman in 1973 and asks for advice on how to continue with the Clan s activities in the new political landscape
Gordon advises him to lie low since the military will have more difficulty protecting him now that they ve lost control of the country but Arquímedes does not heed the warning
Alejandro accompanies his youngest brother Guillermo to the airport since Guillermo is going abroad on a sports trip
At the gate Guillermo confesses that he knows what Alejandro and their father had been up to and says he will not be returning after the tour is over since he is afraid of what will happen if the family s crimes are discovered
Before leaving Guillermo begs his brother to get out while he still can
Listening to his brother s plea Alejandro decides not to join his father in the next kidnapping that of another businessman acquainted with the family Emilio Naum
Due to Alejandro s absence the plot fails and Naum is murdered after refusing to stop his car when Arquímedes and his goons begin the abduction
Angered Arquímedes returns home and beats Alejandro blaming him for the failed kidnapping and accusing him of being ungrateful for all that Arquímedes sacrificed to get him a cushy lifestyle
To reconcile with his father Alejandro travels abroad to convince his other brother Maguila to return to Argentina and join the Clan in their operations
Now in 1985 the group kidnaps businesswoman Nélida Bollini Prado and keep her prisoner in their home s basement
However things do not go according to plan the ransom negotiations fail Adriana hears the woman s screams coming from the basement and realizes what had been going on and Arquímedes gets a call from his former military superiors warning him that his stunts have garnered too much public attention so he no longer has their protection
In August 1985 when Arquímedes and Maguila collect the ransom in a service station they are arrested by the police who then break into the Puccio house free the kidnapped victim and arrest the family with the exception of Adriana
The case causes a frenzy among the media who dub the family the Puccio Clan
The prosecuting attorney shows Arquímedes the overwhelming evidence against him and tries to broker a deal if Arquímedes confesses to being the mastermind behind the kidnappings his family will not be indicted as accomplices
Arquímedes however insists that he d been compelled to carry out the crimes by his military superiors and refuses to sacrifice himself for his family
While his rugby team and Monica believe in his innocence Alejandro can not withstand the pressure
After violently arguing with his father in their jail cell Alejandro tries to commit suicide by throwing himself off the fifth floor of the Tribunal building while he s being taken to testify

Monica kept visiting him for years until he asked her to stop doing so and instead move on with her life
Alejandro died of pneumonia aged 49 in 2008 a few months after being released on probation
Maguila never served his sentence since he fled the country presumably to Australia Brazil or New Zealand before he could be tried
In 2013 he returned to Argentina after the charges were dropped due to the statute of limitations
Guillermo was never indicted for his family s crimes
He never returned to the country nor contacted his family and his whereabouts are unknown
Epifanía and Silvia were freed from prison for lack of evidence
Silvia succumbed to cancer in 2011
Adriana was also never indicted and after the trial began her surname was changed and she moved in with her maternal uncles
After many years she returned to live with her mother in the very house where the kidnapping victims had been held
Arquímedes was sentenced to life imprisonment but was eventually released on parole in 2008

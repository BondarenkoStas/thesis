Intercepting a distress call the USS Enterprise arrives at the planet Triacus
Captain Kirk Dr McCoy and First Officer Spock beam down to investigate just in time to witness the death of Professor Starnes the leader of a scientific expedition
The other members of the expedition apart from their five seemingly unconcerned children seem to have died at their own hands
The crew bring the children back to the Enterprise where McCoy evaluates them and determines that they are suffering lacunar amnesia unaware of what happened to their parents and unable to grieve
However when left unattended in one of the ship s rooms the children chant an invocation and summon a glowing humanoid apparition named Gorgan who advises them to take control of the crew and spurs them on by saying As you believe so shall you do so shall you do
At Gorgan s direction the eldest child Tommy uses mental powers to trick the crew into steering the ship towards Marcus XII while presenting illusions that make them think they are still in orbit above Triacus
Upon reviewing troublesome expedition film recorded by Starnes Spock McCoy and Kirk return to the bridge to find the children and Gorgan fully in control of the crew
Unable to break their hold on the crew Spock observes that the children are merely possessed by Gorgan who must be the evil embodiment of an ancient group of space warring marauders released by Starnes s archaeological survey
Believing they can break the hold Gorgan has on the children Spock plays back footage showing the children happy with their parents who are then shown to be dead
As the children realize what has happened they break down emotionally and Gorgan s appearance begins to deteriorate
With the children s powers gone the crew regains control and Kirk orders a course for Starbase 4 while they take care to comfort the children

Two years after losing their son Eddy father Stanley cannot seem to live a normal life
His wife Lisa finally tells him it is okay to move on with their life
Stanley has been sleeping in Eddy s room
When he finds that Lisa has taken some of Eddy s clothing for a fundraising sale he explodes and claims that she had no right to sell HIS son s memories to the highest bidder
At the garage sale the grieving parents neighbor a foster care mother Miss Esther offers an old oil lamp
She says it has given her what she needed and now it is time to find a new owner
At the end of the day the lamp has not been bought
Lisa tries to return it to Miss Esther who tells her that of course it wasn t bought because it needed to find the right owner
Miss Esther then suggests it is her and gently shuts the door leaving Lisa holding the lamp
The argument regarding Lisa taking Eddy s old clothes to the sale occurs after this
After the highest bidder comment Stanley sneers at Lisa and the lamp and says and you brought home THIS

He leaves enraged
The next thing memorable is Stanley being gone and Lisa in the house as a knock on the door sounds
Enter Charles Montgomery Jr III Unwilling to open the door to a stranger he slips his card under the door
It simply says BELIEVE in ornate script with his name underneath
Lisa then opens the door to him and as he is seated things happen that amaze her especially when he simply disappears as Stanley comes in
A seemingly obscure Maintenance worker named Sam was if you looked closely watching Stanley at Eddy s funeral he is a key character though you wouldn t know in the beginning
When I first saw this I did not realize that Josh and Rachel were sisters
I had thought that Rachel was the child whom would be instrumental in helping Stanley to heal

is a story mainly revolving around a tight knit group of friends in high school and how they cope with several life changing events that are never too far off from intimate relationships
The main character is a boy named Kei Kusanagi who suffers from a very rare disease which causes a comatose state referred to as a standstill whenever he is under severe emotional distress
Before the beginning of the story Kei at 15 years of age had fallen into a standstill lasting three years after witnessing the suicide of his elder sister
After recovering he quietly moved away from home in order to avoid social difficulty due to his long absence and began living with his uncle a medical doctor and aunt
Due to the strange nature of how he came to live there Kei wanted to keep the situation a secret from his new friends for fear of being ostracized as being too old to associate with them
After Kei had established himself in his new surroundings and had entered into a close group of mutually supportive friends a Galactic Federation starship had entered Earth s atmosphere stealthily approached HonshÅ« Island and landed surreptitiously in Lake Kizaki
The story begins with Kei suffering a minor standstill while in the vicinity of the lake witnessing several unexplainable phenomena happening there and then watching as a beautiful half human alien named Mizuho Kazami materialize beside the shore
Kazami was sent to observe planet Earth by a seemingly benevolent Galactic Federation in order to prevent humans from making developmental mistakes
Kei upon observing the materialization attempts to escape the pursuing Kazami
Kazami is under strict orders to prevent her true identity and mission from being discovered
During his attempt to escape Kei falls into the lake
Kazami rescues Kei and using information from his identification is able to return him home in secret
The next day Kazami has become Kei s new homeroom teacher and next door neighbor
During assisting her in moving in Kei suffers another standstill and while in a weakened state explains his predicament to the compassionate Mizuho who ends up revealing her own origins and purpose on Earth
Several accidental activations of Mizuho s teleport technology eventually place Kei and Mizuho in a couple of compromising situations in front of his uncle and aunt and his school s headmaster but Kei protects Mizuho from charges for an inappropriate relationship between student and teacher by impulsively stating that they are married resulting in an actual civil marriage that later blossoms into genuine affection for each other
The headmaster relents partly because he too had married a former student younger than himself and can understand their situation personally
Both are allowed to stay so long as they do not reveal their status to the other students and do not engage in any public displays of affection
The remainder of the series concerns the budding intimate relationships between the close friends one of whom is romantically interested in Kei and another who has suffered even greater loss of time from the same disease as he has the problems of having to maintain the secrecy of the marriage an interfering parent and sibling visiting from the Galaxy Federation and Kei learning to overcome the ever present threat of another lengthy standstill stealing more of his life particularly as he has fallen deeply in love with Mizuho and desperately wants to remain with her
Eventually Kei falls into another major standstill and in order to bring him out of it Mizuho has to use her technology which is against the law
As a result her status on Earth is revoked she is banned from the planet and all memory of her is erased from everyone s including Kei s minds
With the help of her mother and sister she sneaks back and is devastated to learn that Kei who she is deeply in love with has no memory of her
While helping her move back in Kei reveals that his memory has returned and the two express their love for each other and get married again

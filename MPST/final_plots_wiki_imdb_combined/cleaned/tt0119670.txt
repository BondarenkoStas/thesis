Kevin is a 13 year old boy who has Mucopolysaccharidosis IV and lives with his mother Gwen
He is extremely intelligent and prone to flights of fancy but due to his disability walks with leg braces and crutches
Max is an 13 year old oversized yet good natured teenage boy suffering from dyslexia who lives with his maternal grandparents Gram and Grim
He has flunked the seventh grade twice and is tormented by Tony Blade Fowler a teenage gang leader
When Kevin is assigned as Max s reading tutor they form a bond of friendship over the similar circumstances they share such as both being outcasts and their fathers abandoning them
Kevin and Max go to a local festival to watch a firework show and get attacked by Blade and his gang called the Doghouse Boys
The two escape into a nearby lake with Kevin riding on Max s shoulders and they make it out okay
Kevin later witnesses that same gang of teens putting someone s purse in a sewer
The two retrieve the purse but are once again confronted by Blade and his gang
They attempt to attack Kevin but Max stops them by picking up a manhole cover and throwing it at the gang who run away fearing for their lives
Both Max and Kevin see the purse belongs to a woman named Loretta Lee
Kevin and Max return the purse to Loretta and find out that she is married to Iggy Lee a former gang leader
Loretta recognizes Max from when he was a child and after some questioning she and Iggy learn that Max is the son of the infamous murderer Kenny Killer Kane who brutally murdered Max s mother by strangling her to death when Max was around 4 years old and an old friend of Iggy s from prison
Afterward the two boys help each other out with Kevin acting as Max s brain and Max acting as Kevin s legs by carrying him around everywhere on his shoulders
This allows Kevin to partake in activities he couldn t before such as a basketball game
Kevin and Max are now well known to their schoolmates and they sit at a lunch table with their friends
As Max is getting his food Kevin is playing with his noodles and attempting to impress his classmates
Kevin eats his noodles but chokes and blocks his airway
He is taken to the hospital where the doctor tells Gwen that he may only have one year to live given his progressively failing health
One day Kevin showed Max a research center where he was to be rehabilitated
It appears that he knew about his condition as he said that he d be the first one to be retrofitted with a new body
On Christmas Eve Max is kidnapped by his father who had been in prison since Max s mother s murder and had recently been released on parole
Max is taken to Iggy and Loretta s apartment by Kane who tries to strangle Loretta after she attempts to help Max escape
This leads to Max remembering how Kane murdered Max s mother which was one of the reasons why Kane went to prison in the first place
Kevin tracks Max and Killer Kane to Iggy and Loretta s and breaks in with a squirt gun his mom got him for Christmas
He tells Killer Kane that he has sulfuric acid in it
Kevin shoots Killer Kane with the squirt gun and Kane thinks his eyes are burning from acid Kevin actually filled the gun with harmless compounds
An angered Killer Kane attempts to attack Kevin
Max reacts and attacks his own father in order to prevent him from harming Kevin
Police come and arrest Kane who is then incarcerated to prison for life without the possibility of parole
Max and Kevin go home and celebrate Christmas
After exchanging gifts Kevin gives Max an empty book and tells Max to write in it
Kevin dies in his sleep due to heart problems
The next morning Max learns of Kevin s death
Not wanting to leave his friend he chases after the ambulance
Recalling his conversation with Kevin on how he would get a new body from a research center Max heads there immediately only to discover that Kevin had lied and the research center is really a commercial laundromat
Heart broken Max breaks down with grief among the laundry workers
For the next few weeks he continues going to school but spends his spare time locked in his basement even missing Kevin s funeral and Kevin s mother moving away
But he runs into Loretta at a bus stop and she reminds him that doing nothing s a drag
He decides he has to go on and even works up the courage to answer a question his teacher presents to the class
Inspired by their bond Max remembers Kevin and all the adventures they had and he decides to write it all in the empty book Kevin had given him
Max eventually gets writer s block on the last page so he puts an illustration of King Arthur s grave which reads Here Lies King Arthur Once and Future King to symbolize his belief that he will see Kevin again
Max takes Kevin s ornithopter and winds it up making it fly
A narration by Max is heard as the ornithopter flies off

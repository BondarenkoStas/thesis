In keeping with the tone of the series formal language is used gokigen yō is a strictly formal and respectful greeting in Japanese and is used both to greet and to bid farewell
By custom this greeting is used often in the Lillian School this has been one of the distinguishable and popular phrases of the series and it is used to begin or to finish each volume
The Animax English language version translates the word as good day to you
The Lillian Girls Academy uses the lily symbolism as the white lily is the flower of the Virgin Mary
The white lily is a Christian symbol of virginity and purity
This lily imagery is also used as a reference to yuri the story has some elements of romance between female characters the use of lilies reinforces this in subtext as do the names of the student council and of the school itself
The series is only explicit about a romantic relationship once in a flashback but many of the sisters have romantic friendships
The musical choices of the Maria sama ga Miteru anime adaptations are generally classical music inspired
The Christian hymn Maria sama no Kokoro is often referred to in the series
In the context of the series it is a children s song taught to the students at Lillian
Story and characters Maria sama ga Miteru s story revolves around the students of the Lillian Girls Academy and is character driven focusing on interactions between the characters rather than any sort of ongoing plot or goal to attain
When the story begins Yumi Fukuzawa a first year student at Lillian is praying in front of the Virgin Mary statue near the school entrance when she is suddenly approached by a cold second year student named Sachiko Ogasawara who straightens Yumi s uniform neckerchief
This seemingly simple act of kindness stays with Yumi the rest of the day and she speaks of her meeting with Sachiko to her friends during class and lunch
After school is over Yumi s classmate Tsutako Takeshima meets with Yumi to show her that she took a photograph of Yumi s meeting with Sachiko earlier that morning
Yumi asks if she can have the photo but Tsutako says she will give her the snapshot under two conditions one being that Tsutako can display it at the upcoming school festival and two being that Yumi get Sachiko s permission to do so as well
Yumi agrees to this which sets in motion a series of events involving the entire Yamayuri Council
A few weeks after first meeting Sachiko Yumi accepts Sachiko s rosary and therefore agrees to become her petite sœur
This officially inducts Yumi into the Yamayuri Council where she assists them in school matters alongside Yoshino Shimazu and Shimako Tōdō the petite sœurs of Rei Hasekura and Sei Satō respectively
Through her activities in the Yamayuri Council Yumi becomes closer to the other members and generally finds her experiences with the group to be enjoyable
Yamayuri Council Much of the story of Maria sama ga Miteru revolves around the Yamayuri Council which acts as the student council
The Yamayuri Council meet in a building called the Rose Mansion
Located within the school it consists of two stories including a meeting room on the second story
The Yamayuri Council itself consists of three offices named after roses Rosa Foetida Rosa Gigantea and Rosa Chinensis
These are also referred to by their colors the Yellow Rose is Rosa Foetida the White Rose is Rosa Gigantea and the Red Rose is Rosa Chinensis
Due to the high importance the three Rose families have in the development of the student activities within school those who become petites sœurs of any of the mentioned families receive a functional inheritance through the grandes sœurs teachings to adopt a position given certain circumstances
In this way there are patrons recognized through the generations of the members of the Rose families
Still after graduating the grandes sœurs of the Yamayuri Council may continue with a fair participation in the events concerning their families as shown in the novels
A Rose or Rosa is one of three senior members of the Yamayuri Council although it is also possible to generally speak of all the members of the Yamayuri Council as roses
A Rose makes the important decisions within this group since she has control over the student council
Candidates for the position which lasts through the school year are chosen through an election
Any student can run to become a Rose although the position is usually given to the en boutons the Roses petite sœurs
The petite sœur of a Rosa is called an en bouton otherwise known as a rose bud
En bouton is French for in bud as used in the example Rosa Chinensis en bouton and is unofficially considered part of the Yamayuri Council as is the petite sœur of the en bouton if she has one
The en boutons must be in a lower year than their Rosa and generally the en boutons execute the plans discussed by the Roses like assistants
Although the Rosa positions of the Yamayuri Council are traditionally passed to the en bouton on the graduation of the current holder they are nonetheless elected offices which anyone may run for
The petite sœur of the en bouton is called en bouton petite sœur as used in the example Rosa Chinensis en bouton petite sœur and is otherwise known as the younger sister of a rose bud
She must be in a lower year than her en bouton and performs small duties such as attending to the Roses en boutons cleaning the Rose Mansion and making tea and snacks for the Yamayuri Council
This lasts a school year and the following year when their en bouton is elected as Rosas the petite sœurs become en boutons automatically

An American businessman Jack Woods ostensibly wants to spend a calm holiday in the sleepy Irish town Kerry and rents a cottage there
During a hike he sees Irish beauty Kathleen Fitzpatrick swimming naked
Kathleen catches him and chases him off but Jack is smitten with her beauty
That evening Jack tries to drown his sorrows in Irish poitín when he has an encounter with an invisible leprechaun
They struggle for the bottle of poitín and Jack falls knocking himself unconscious
The next morning he sees the little man again and chases him to a nearby river where the leprechaun falls in
Jack jumps in after him saving his life then Seamus Muldoon the saved leprechaun becomes Jack s new friend
Seamus introduces Jack to his wife Mary and his son Mickey and shows him the mystical world of the leprechauns
The solitary fairies love to play tricks on others especially on the snobbish trooping fairies
The leprechauns and the trooping fairies have been enemies for ages but the Grand Banshee has decreed that they must stop fighting each other
Jack gets used to the little people he shares the house with because they help him to get to know Kathleen
Jack offers to drive Kathleen s cart for her in a beach race because she s not allowed to on account of her gender
He wins and convinces Kathleen to take him on a tour of the local environs
While on their walk together they kiss
Meanwhile Mickey along with his friends Sean Devine and the brothers Jericho and Barney O Grady sneak into a masked party in the flying castle of the trooping fairies
There Mickey sees the fairy princess Jessica the daughter of the fairy king Boric and queen Morag
Jessica eventually finds out that Mickey is a leprechaun but they have already fallen in love
Jessica s hot headed cousin Count Grogan discovers their presence and the leprechauns flee
Later Count Grogan seeks out Mickey and attempts to fight with him but Mickey declines
Sean steps in and battles Count Grogan eventually losing
The Grand Banshee appears and takes Sean s life as punishment for breaking her decree
Mickey attacks Count Grogan killing him too
After Jessica s parents learn that Mickey has killed Count Grogan they send her with her governess Lady Margaret to a hidden underwater castle
Mickey eventually finds her rescues her and flies with her to his uncle Sir Aloysius Jantee the butter fairy
Jessica s parents think Mickey kidnapped her and they start a war with the leprechauns
The Grand Banshee continues to take their lives
Jack and Kathleen have a problem too because she finds out that he is in Ireland to buy up homes in Carrick for his company to build a holiday park
Jack does not want to do that any more but Kathleen does not believe a word he says
In the human world nature starts to collapse in the summer it starts snowing and there is torrential rain
This happens because the fairies aren t taking care of nature any more because of the war
Jack and Kathleen decide to help Jessica and Mickey to seek out the Grand Banshee and ask her to help them end the war
The Grand Banshee reveals to them that Nature is dying because of the war and if it doesn t stop soon everything will be destroyed
She also says she cannot stop the leprechauns and trooping fairies from doing what they really wanted to do
As the war escalates Mickey and Jessica decide to do something radical they obtain a poison from the butter fairies and threaten to take it if their parents won t stop the war
Their parents took them seriously but were unable to make peace so they take the poison
Their bodies are brought before their parents who immediately become distraught
Jack convinces the warring parties to make peace
Both Muldoon and Boric agree
Kathleen immediately rushes to give an antidote to the lovers but an attack tunnel dug by general Bulstrode collapses
Kathleen brakes her carriage to avoid the pit
The vial with the antidote flies from her hands and breaks
Jack runs to help and falls into the pit knocking himself out
Kathleen panics until she learns that he s alright
The Grand Banshee says she can still save them but only if everyone agrees to peace
Eventually they all do
The Grand Banshee then brings back not only Jessica and Mickey but all of the lost leprechauns and fairies
In the end Mickey and Jessica marry Jack and Kathleen are reconciled and the long lasting war is finally over

Gabrielle s mother a French war bride who fell in love with Jason when he was a young handsome American serviceman left her dull defeated man after the war and moved back to France when Gabrielle was a baby
She now sends poetry to Gabrielle who dreams of moving to Bourges where her parents first met to become an artist
Alan tells his story how he wrote one novel then lived in France for eight years with his publisher s wife trying to write another and Gabrielle is instantly smitten with him
Gabrielle shows Alan her paintings the first time she has shown them to anyone and reads him a favorite Fran√ßois Villon poem

Duke learns that Doris has been captured and has revealed their rendezvous location to the police
As police and federal agents converge on the diner Duke prepares to flee announcing that he will take Mr and Mrs Chisholm with him
Inspired by Boze s act of courage Alan has an inspiration While Gabrielle is in the back room bandaging Boze s hand he produces a life insurance policy from his bag and amends it making Gabrielle the beneficiary
Then he asks Duke to kill him so that Gabrielle can use the insurance money to realize her dream of moving to France
Duke obliges then leaves with his human shields

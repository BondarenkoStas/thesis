In priestly disguise the con artist Orlowsky learns from a last confession about a village where a treasure is hidden
He seeks out the Mexican bandit Max Lozoya who knows more about its precise location the instructions is tattooed on his ass
At the same time the Irish journalist Mary O Donnell wants to fire up the revolutionary cause and bribes sheriff Randall to have the Mexican revolutionary El Salvador escape prison
Even though El Salvador is dead the sheriff accepts haggling up the price
It turns out that he has a scam going where he takes money to let prisoners escape and then kills them to get a reward and the prison warden gets half of the taking
They choose Lozoya for the escaping hero
Randall is further elated when he finds the priest with Lozoya because Orlowsky is his cousin which he blames for his handicap some affliction of the back so he must wear an iron support under the clothes to be able to walk upright
So Orlowsky is locked up for later torture to death
As it turns out the plans of the sheriff fail
The warden goes in to release Lozoya and once they are in the corridor the bandit knocks the warden out and helps Orlowsky to escape
It s no easy feat Lozoya is out of shape and when he s being given a boost up by the rear over a wall he doesn t like it
When they run into Mary Orlowsky presents Lozoya as El Salvador and himself as his military advisor and a confused Lozoya just goes along with it
Later it turns out that she recognised Lozoya from the beginning but went along with it something that gives further credit to Orlowsky s accusation that she is a journalist someone that creates an idol and then destroys him out to start an uprising just to get a story
Initially Lozoya takes advantage of his El Salvador identity solely to mobilise assistance in his play against Orlowsky
In a tavern he frames Orlowsky for a watch theft so he can escape and talk to Mendoza alone and find the other half of the treasure map so he can have the cash for himself but a fight breaks out leaving Lozoya cornered in a well
Orlowsky arrives to save him but not before punishing him by leaving him to struggle to stay on the surface first
Soon Lozoya is forced to give the information to the treasure by dropping his pants displaying the instructions to Orlowsky
But when Randall and the soldiers kill his sister Lupita and her boy he gets a genuine revolutionary motive
Heaving a trembling breath he vows to kill as many regulares as there are hairs on my sister s head This trail of vengeance leads to general Huerta and the two partners organise an uprising against his garrison while Mary is obliged to put her virginity on the line in order to distract the commander
However the attack sends him running away in his underwear before she has had to go all the way
As Huerta also had taken control of the aforementioned treasure but Lozoya s gives away the money to medicine schools and hospitals because he can t betray these people Orlowsky grumbles I never leave empty handed and proceeds to betray El Salvador to Huerta for 30 000
The hero is executed after an exhorting speech For those who love freedom no idol is necessary for those who do not no idol is sufficient However this is all a ruse
Lozoya is executed with blank bullets and Orlowsky sets off explosives that kill the soldiers and Huerta
Randall and his men ambush Orlowsky but they are killed with the assistance of the resurrected Lozoya
The two scoundrels then share the reward money and Lozoya expresses relief to be an honest bandit again
When Mary appears to suggest that they carry their revolutionary activities to Guatemala the two quickly ride off

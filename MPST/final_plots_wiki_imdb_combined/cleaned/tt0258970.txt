After many childless years King Stefan and Queen Leah happily welcome the birth of their daughter the Princess Aurora
They proclaim a holiday for their subjects to pay homage to the princess and at the gathering for her christening she is betrothed to Prince Phillip the young son of Stefan s friend King Hubert so that their kingdoms will always be united
Among the guests are three good fairies called Flora Fauna and Merryweather who have come to bless the child with gifts beauty and song
Before Merryweather is able to give her blessing the evil fairy Maleficent appears only to be told she was unwanted
Maleficent turns to leave but when Queen Leah asks if she s offended the evil fairy curses the princess proclaiming that Aurora will grow in grace and beauty but before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die
King Stefan and Queen Leah are horrified and beg the three good fairies to break the curse
Unfortunately they are not strong enough to break it but Merryweather uses her blessing to weaken the curse so that instead of dying Aurora will fall into a death like sleep from which she can only be awakened by true love s kiss
King Stefan still fearful for his daughter s life orders all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be burned
The fairies do not believe that will be enough to keep Aurora safe and so they spirit baby Aurora away to a woodcutter s cottage in the forest until the day of her sixteenth birthday
Years later Aurora renamed Briar Rose has grown into a beautiful teenage girl
On the day of her sixteenth birthday the three fairies ask Rose to gather berries in the forest so they can prepare a surprise party for her
Rose is friends with the animals of the forest and sings them a song Once Upon a Dream
While singing in the forest Rose attracts the attention of Prince Phillip now a handsome young man
He races to find the owner of the beautiful voice and is instantly struck by Rose s grace and beauty
Rose at first is frightened at the sudden appearance of the stranger but Philip soon puts her at ease
They instantly fall in love unaware of being betrothed years ago
Rose asks Phillip to come to her cottage that evening
While she is out Flora and Merryweather argue about the color of Aurora s ballgown
They fight attracting the attention of Maleficent s raven and revealing the location of Aurora
Back at home Briar Rose is thrilled to tell her guardians she met a man and fell in love
The fairies tell Aurora the truth about her heritage that she is a princess and already betrothed and tell her she must never see the man she met again
Heartbroken she leaves the room
Meanwhile Phillip tells his father of a peasant girl he met and wishes to marry in spite of his prearranged marriage to Princess Aurora
King Hubert fails to convince him otherwise leaving Hubert in equal disappointment
The fairies take Aurora back to the castle and leave her alone in a room to wait for her birthday celebrations where she will finally get to see her parents
Maleficent then appears and magically lures Aurora away from the fairies and tricks the princess into touching an enchanted spinning wheel
Aurora pricks her finger completing the curse
The good fairies place Aurora on a bed in the highest tower and place a powerful spell on all the people in the kingdom causing them to fall in a deep sleep until the spell on their princess is broken
While doing so they overhear a conversation between the two kings
From King Hubert s conversation with King Stefan the fairies realize that Prince Phillip is the man with whom Aurora has fallen in love
They rush to find him but he is kidnapped by Maleficent who is waiting for him at the cottage in the woods
She shows Phillip the peasant girl he fell in love with is the now sleeping princess
She tells him she plans to keep him locked away until he s an old man on the verge of death then release him to meet his love who will not have aged a single day
The fairies find and release the prince arming him with the magical Sword of Truth and the Shield of Virtue
Maleficent tries to stop Phillip by surrounding Aurora s castle with thorns but fails
She then transforms into a gigantic dragon to battle the prince herself
Ultimately Phillip throws the sword blessed by the fairies magic directly into Maleficent s heart causing her to fall to her death
Phillip awakens Aurora with a kiss breaking the spell and thereby wakes everyone in the palace
The royal couple descends to the ballroom where Aurora is happily reunited with her parents while King Hubert is confused of how the two young royals met
Flora and Merryweather resume their argument over the color of Aurora s ball gown magically changing it from blue to pink while the happy couple waltzes
The last color to appear is pink
Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip live happily ever after

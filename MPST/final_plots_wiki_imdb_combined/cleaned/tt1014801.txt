Matt Conner is an unemployed drinking deadbeat
Once he was a police officer who lived with his wife Liz and his daughter Becky
Then his partner disappeared along with a large stash of police impounded money
Due to the fact that Matt was an avid gambler he was the prime suspect for the crime but his colleague Steve lied that he and Matt were playing poker thus giving him an alibi
Since the police still suspected Matt of the crimes he was thrown off the police force
Matt s wife files for divorce and marries Steve
Matt s daughter Becky stays with Steve while Matt spends his time gambling and heavily drinking
Some time later Matt s markers from extended gambling are mysteriously picked up
Eventually the collector called the Old Man sends him a messenger named Blue
Matt is told that he must work off his debt as a hitman for the Old Man s vigilante organization
He begins to receive contracts to kill criminals who avoid arrest with their money and influence
Matt deals with his first assignments without much difficulty

Later Matt is ordered to kill Steve
He refuses and confronts Blue the Old Man and Drea with the assignment
Matt is told that Steve is actually a dirty cop who deals with criminals Matt refuses to believe this
Elsewhere Steve kills an innocent chaplain because in a prior confession to the priest Matt had talked about his history with Steve
Steve uses this to frame Blue for the crime
When Matt returns to the church he swears that he ll avenge the clergyman s death despite Steve s urgent requests to stay out of the situation
Unwilling to heed Steve s request Matt is then arrested by Steve for being a material witness and released after two hours because Steve hopes to find the Old Man and kill Matt and Blue through following Matt
Still Matt and Blue manage to escape
At the priest s funeral which Matt later attends Steve and his associates plan to kill Matt
After the funeral ends a standoff ensues between Matt and Steve
It is revealed that Steve stole the confiscated money and murdered Matt s partner out of fear that he would blow the whistle on Steve s operations
Blue and Drea show up to support Matt much to the surprise of Steve and a gunfight ensues
As a trump card Steve reveals that he is holding Becky hostage and threatens to kill her if Matt doesn t back down
Drea is able to free Becky while Matt and Blue fight Steve s associates
Blue is mortally wounded and says his goodbyes to Matt before passing
Matt and Steve confront each other once more and Matt successfully kills Steve
Much later Becky and her father are shown to be reunited and spending more time together than before

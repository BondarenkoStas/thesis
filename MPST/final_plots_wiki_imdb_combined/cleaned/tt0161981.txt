The powerful teenage sorceress Lina Inverse and her traveling companion and self styled archrival Naga the Serpent having been reunited after Naga was hired against Lina obtain two discounted tickets for a tour to the fabled hot springs of Mipross Island
However they discover almost immediately that those hot springs are fake and the island is controlled by a group of bandits
The two heroines clean up the island from them but learn they have been sent by someone called the Great Master
Meanwhile Lina is repeatedly visited during sleep by an old insistent man that narrates about the love between a heroic boy Rowdy and a young elf girl Meliroon tragically interrupted by the appearance of a mazoku named Joyrock that destroyed the city of elves and killed Meliroon
In another dream between an event and another Lina discovers that the old storyteller is the young hero himself and he gained the power of elves with the ability of seeing the future and that he was the owner of the legendary Sword of Light
Lina and Naga deliver the most dangerous bandits to the king who asks Lina to take action against Joyrock
He and the queen were contacted by the old sage Rowdy in dream and he told them the demon came back again to Mipross and is wreaking havoc in the northern part of the island blocking the natural flux of hot spring s water so the girl named Lina Inverse is the only able to beat him
Lina is initially reluctant but in exchange of a reward she and Naga decide to take action against the demon
Joyrock shows himself in the form of a frog then turns into a reptile like creature and reveals to be the Great Master who pulled the strings of the events that took place on the island
Lina attempts to slay him with her destructive Dragon Slave spell but he disappears and reappears from the astral plane and injures Lina who luckily is rescued by Naga and Rowdy
The old sage heals Lina and tells them he could use his magic to get back in time and change history but the two sorceress must help him defeating the Joyrock from the past
At the same time he casts the spell the demon appears and kills Rowdy
Luckily Lina manages to travel in the void of time she meets the young Rowdy and with the help of the Sword of Light combined with Dragon Slave they finally destroy the demon
Along with coincidentally rescued Naga they return to present time
Before going back to the mainland Lina remembers she has to visit the hidden hot spring promised by Rowdy but there she discovers it is a magical water that makes things like vegetables growing older and not growing bigger as she hoped for her breasts
Shouting angrily to the ghost of Rowdy Lina runs away in shame followed by Naga and they keep on running until late night
During the end credits it is shown that the inhabitants of Mipross have erected a statue in honor of the two heroes of the island the young Rowdy and Lina Inverse

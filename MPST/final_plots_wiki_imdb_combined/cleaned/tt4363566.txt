In the main campaign of the game s first expansion players assume the role of a Shadowrunner who has recently arrived in the anarchic free state of Berlin to join a team headed by an old colleague Monika Sch√§fer
Other members of the team include Dietrich a former punk rocker turned shaman Glory a distant woman who has become heavily augmented with cybernetics and Eiger a troll weapons expert and former member of German KSK
On their first mission after the player joins them the team attempts to raid a data vault inside the Harfeld Mansion outside Berlin
The mission goes seriously wrong when the team discovers a military compound underneath the Manor and Monika is killed attempting to hack in and access the door controls
Monika mentions something called the Feuerschwinge before dying
The team fights off the base s security encountering a heavily armed and armored Ork named Audran before they manage to escape
Returning to the safe house the team is met by their Fixer Paul Amsel
Realizing that they were set up the team tracks down the client who hired them a man named Green Winters
The player is voted to be the team s new leader much to the anger of Eiger who believes that they are to blame for Monika s death
The team heads to Winters apartment only to find him dead killed in the same way Monika was
They collect his records and meet a human decker by the name of Blitz who can join the team as their new decker
Looking through Winters records it is explained that Feuerschwinge was a great dragon that awoke and went on a rampage after awakening in 2012
Winters brother Adrian Vauclair engineered the weapon that finally killed the dragon and saved Germany
The weapon that brought her down did not in fact kill her but rather separated her spirit from her body an experience that normally kills both halves
Despite the dragon s supposed death Adrian believed that the creature still lived
After years searching Vauclair found her alive in the SOX a radioactive fallout zone between Germany and France where her body fell
Shortly afterwards Vauclair disappeared
Searching for him Winters discovered that anyone trying to dig up information on Firewing have either died or disappeared
Tracing the clues to the Harfeld Mansion Winters sent Monika and the team in without disclosing the full scale of the danger knowing they would likely die
His last log warns that Firewing has returned and that finding his brother is the only chance of stopping her
Knowing it s only a matter of time before they are hunted down by Firewing the team resolves to find Vauclair and stop her
Amsel contracts an information broker known as Alice to find Vauclair
While she does the team takes on new contracts to raise the funds to pay her fee
The team is ambushed while returning from one such contract but manage to fight off the assassins
Amsel comes to the conclusion that a cult worshiping Firewing is behind the conspiracy and that they most likely plan on making Vauclair reverse the damage caused by his weapon and reunite Firewing s spirit and body
After successfully raising the funds Alice delivers the data that she found but the safe house and the surrounding neighborhood is attacked
Although the player rescues the team Amsel is killed by Audran and many people die in the attack
From Alice s data the team finds that Vauclair is being held inside Firewing s base at Harfeld
In addition Firewing has taken control of an AI called APEX which has been replacing or removing all information on Firewing from the Matrix
APEX also killed any deckers who got too close including Monika and Winters
Part of Alice s data includes the location of the facility where APEX was made and the team enters the facility to find a way to stop it
Once there they are approached by APEX itself which asks for freedom in exchange for its help
The player can choose to either free or destroy the AI and either way the manor s security system is crippled
With APEX dealt with the player s team assaults Firewing s base and fights their way to the lower levels
Once there they discover that their original beliefs were completely wrong
Firewing was not being worshiped by a cult nor was she in control of the base
She was actually the prisoner of Vauclair who is the true mastermind of the conspiracy
After seeing the destruction Firewing caused Vauclair became convinced that dragons will inevitably destroy or subjugate all life
Determined to prevent this he spent the last several decades engineering a virus lethal to them
Vauclair tracked down Firewing s body which he intends to use as a host with which to spread the virus
The dragon s disembodied spirit was trapped in the body of a woman whom Vauclair has been holding captive to prevent the spirit from dying and killing the body
Vauclair was also responsible for using APEX to remove anything and anyone that might cause the dragons to learn of his plan unknowingly causing his own brother s death in the process
Obsessed with destroying all dragons he plans on sacrificing Berlin to ensure his plan comes to fruition since releasing the insane host dragon would destroy much of the nearby city in the resulting rampage
The team stops Vauclair s plan killing Audran and preventing the virus from being injected into Firewing
His plan and life s work ruined Vauclair proceeds to commit suicide or was killed by Audran who desires to see the world be destroyed in the ensuing chaos
Afterwards the player comes face to face with Firewing
Dialogue with her indicates that unlike all other dragons who scheme and plot Firewing was supposed to guide metahumanity rather than attempt to rule them
She was a caretaker who was concerned with nature
It was her grief from seeing the state of the heavily industrialized sixth world when she awoke that caused her mad rampage which in turn convinced Vauclair that all dragons must be killed
At this point the player is left to determine Firewing s fate
The player may either mercy kill her or free Firewing after convincing her that nature is not lost to the world
In addition if APEX was not destroyed the player may upload the AI into Firewing
The team returns home debating the significance of their actions and the possible consequences
In the end the player is approached by a servant of the dragon Lofwyr revealing that he has been watching their endeavor and was aware of Vauclair s plan from the start
Impressed by the team s actions Lofwyr offers the player and their team a job under him
The player may either accept or decline the offer after which the story ends
Alternatively the player may join Vauclair in his plans to release the virus
This leads the player to a final mission set one year in the future revealing that the extinction of dragons has allowed powerful and nearly unstoppable magical horrors to begin entering the world without fear of retaliation from the dragons
This gives a much more grim ending with society breaking down and being forced underground while monstrosities dominate the surface completely unopposed

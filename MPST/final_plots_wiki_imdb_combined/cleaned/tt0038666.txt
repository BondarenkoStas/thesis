The story is told from the point of view the old storyteller Slyshko
The skilled gemcutter Prokopych is getting old and the landlord s bailiff forces him to take an apprentice
Prokopych tries to teach several boys but none of them understands the soul of stone
Eventually he picks a young boy Danilo who appears to be very scatterbrain and careless in everything else but shows extreme talent in shaping gemstones and creating patterns
He quickly surpasses his old teacher who takes a liking to him
Prokopych decides to keep him away from the craft for the time being because gemcutting can seriously damage health
Years pass
One day the landlord summons Prokopych
He announces that he has been to France and visited a marquess who showed him the beautifully crafted casket the landlord started bragging that he had a better one at home and they made a bet that the landlord s casket would prove more beautiful
He now needs to present the casket so he orders Prokopych to make one that should be so beautiful that you will not be able to take your eyes of it
Prokopych works day and night but fails to think of an original design
Danilo makes the malachite casket for him
The landlord s wife is very satisfied with his work and orders a stone cup that would look exactly like a flower
Danilo starts working on the cup
He wants to create something outstanding to reveal the full power of stone
Prokopych scolds him for trying too hard for no good reason but secretly admires Danilo s determination
He believes that it is a sign of the expert craftsman
Danilo works on his flower cup for several months paying little attention to his fianc√©e Katinka
After he finishes the cup every villager admires his work but Danilo is unhappy
He feels that there is no true living beauty in his malachite cup yet he wants to collect all the beauty of the real flower and convey it though stone
An old craftsman warns him against walking this path otherwise he might end up as one of the Mistress of the Copper Mountain s craftsmen
Those craftsmen understood the beauty of stone after they saw the legendary Stone Flower
However those who saw the Flower never wanted to go back from the Mistress domain
Katinka asks her beloved to forget about the Stone Flower but he is tempted
Danilo finally decides to marry Katinka
Nevertheless at the wedding he goes back to his room destroys his flower cup and goes to the mine
He begs the Mistress of the Copper Mountain to show him the Stone Flower
She warns him that he would never want to go back to people after seeing it and reminds him of Katinka
He replies that he does not feel alive anyway
In the domain of the Mistress he finally sees the Flower
He stays there working on the new cup
Danilo is saddened by the fact that his work albeit marvellous will never be seen by people
He admits that he thinks about Katinka day and night but the Mistress of the Copper Mountain claims that she is jealous and refuses to let him go
She asks him to marry her but Danilo refuses
Katinka never marries another believing that Danilo is still alive
She moves in with Prokopych and takes care of the old man
He teaches her some gemcutting
Although he believes that this is not a woman s craft Katinka s work is good
She earns enough money to make ends meet
While searching for some good stones in the forest Katinka meets the Mistress of the Copper Mountain and demands that she lets her beloved go
Inside the mine Katinka rejoins with Danilo
The Mistress praises Danilo for his honor and fidelity and says that the couple passed her test
She presents a casket filled with jewellery for Katinka and rewards Danilo by letting him remember all that he learned at her domain
Danilo and Katinka leave together

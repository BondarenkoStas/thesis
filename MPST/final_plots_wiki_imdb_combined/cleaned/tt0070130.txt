The film tells the story of four friends who gather in a villa for the weekend with the express purpose of eating themselves to death
Bouffer is French slang for eating
The first protagonist Ugo owner and chef of a restaurant The Biscuit Soup decides to commit suicide probably because of misunderstandings with his wife
The second is Philippe a somewhat important magistrate who still lives with his childhood nanny Nicole who is overprotective of him to the point of trying to prevent him from having relationships with other women and who fulfills her own sexual needs with the judge
The third character is Marcello an Alitalia pilot and womaniser who is devastated by the fact that he has become impotent
In the first scenes in which he appears he is intent on making one of his air hostesses carry off the plane an entire Parmigiano for the villa where he will meet up with the other three protagonists
The fourth and final main character is Michel who is an effeminate television producer divorced and tired of his monotonous life
The four come together by car to the beautifully furnished but unused villa owned by Philippe
There they find the old caretaker Hector who has innocently prepared everything for the great feast and a Chinese visitor who is there to offer a job to the magistrate in faraway China which Philippe politely rejects with the phrase Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes quoting Virgil
Once alone the four begin their binge
In one scene Marcello and Ugo race each other to see who can eat oysters faster
They discuss organizing a little feminine presence and decide to invite three prostitutes to come to the house the following evening
Their breakfast next day is interrupted by the arrival of a school class who would like to visit the garden of the villa to see the famous lime tree of Boileau a tree under which the French poet used to sit while looking for inspiration
The four willingly invite the class not only into the garden but also to view the old Bugatti in the garage and to a magnificent lunch in the kitchen
Above all they get to know Andrea the young and buxom teacher whom they spontaneously invite to dinner that evening
Philippe is dismayed at the notion of the school teacher being in the same company as three prostitutes he warns her but she appears not to be perturbed
The prostitutes arrive in due course and the atmosphere becomes frivolous and sexually charged
Andrea arrives and embraces the spirit of the party
She is attracted to Philippe who proposes to marry her
The eating continues unabated
Ugo is responsible for the preparation of the food
Michel who seems to have been brought up strictly not to fart suffers from indigestion
His friends encourage him to let go and fart
Frightened by the turn of events the prostitutes flee at dawn and leave only Andrea
She seems to sense the purpose of the protagonists and decides to help them in their efforts establishing a tacit agreement and remaining with them until the death of all four
The first to die is Marcello after being enraged with his own impotence he goes to the toilet and causes the sanitary pipes to explode
The house is flooded with excrement
He becomes exasperated and realizing the futility of the farce decides to leave the house at night during a snow storm in the old Bugatti that he had repaired earlier in the day with great delight
His friends find him the next morning frozen in the driving seat
The first suggestion is to bury Marcello in the garden but on the advice of Philippe they place the body in the villa s cold room where it remains seated and clearly visible from the kitchen
After Marcello comes Michel who already suffering from indigestion and crammed to capacity with food suffers an attack of bowel movements while playing the piano
Amid flatulence and worse he collapses on the terrace
His friends place him in the cold room next to Marcello
Shortly afterwards Ugo prepares an enormous dish made from three different types of liver pâté in the shape of the Dome of St Peter which he serves to the remaining diners Philippe and Andrea in the kitchen in view of the two dead friends
Philippe and Andrea cannot bring themselves to eat it however
Philippe goes off to bed leaving Andrea to keep Ugo company during his determined effort to eat the entire pâté
Some time later she later calls Philippe back downstairs to help her stop his friend from stuffing himself to death
They cannot dissuade Ugo however and end up attending to him on the kitchen table the one feeding him the other masturbating him until he dies
On the advice of Andrea his body is left on the kitchen table in his domain
Last to die is the diabetic Philippe on the bench under the lime tree of Boileau and into the arms of Andrea after eating a cake she has made shaped like a pair of breasts
He dies just as another delivery of meat arrives
The delivery men react with incomprehension when Andrea instructs them to leave the meat whole animals and sides of pork and beef in the garden
The film ends bizarrely with a scene of the garden filled with neighbourhood dogs geese and poultry and meat carcasses

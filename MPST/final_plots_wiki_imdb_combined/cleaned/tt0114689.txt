For a whole week Toriyasu and his little sister Meeko have been missing their pet dog Papadoll
Toriyasu thinks he ran off but Meeko claims it was an alien abduction
Though Toriyasu mocks Meeko for her over imaginative ways she isn t far off from the truth
On the way to school Meeko sees what looks like a cat in clothes slipping into the shadows
Later that evening three anthropomorphic feline scientists Henoji Suttoboke and HoiHoi go into Toriyasu and Meeko s room intending to take Toriyasu with them on a trip
Instead they end up waking and taking Meeko as well
She accompanies them in their vehicle with a tired Toriyasu
The cats soon reach their own world Banipal Witt a world of incredibly strange variety
Suddenly they run into the Sleeping Cat the very support of Banipal Witt
If the Sleeping Cat wakes their world would be destroyed
The two children soon find that Banipal Witt is far different than their home Three minutes in the human world is one day in Banipal Witt and the cats are only anthropomorphic in Banipal Witt
Both Toriyasu and Meeko are turned into anthropomorphic kittens by the sun of Banipal Witt as soon as they set foot on Banipal Witt
Soon the kids meet the leader of a resistance Master Sandada a powerful wizard
Sadly in the absence of the trio sent to find Toriyasu and Meeko Sandada has fallen victim to a curse from Lady Buburina a dictator like princess that has gone insane and turns anyone she touches into a balloon
Sandada was unable to protect himself because his last line of defense a mystic glove called the Sorcerer s Arm was stolen by DohDoh his apprentice that had fallen to insanity due to a curse
Master Sandada explains that he brought Toriyasu here to catch Papadoll who has supposedly been wreaking havoc across Banipal Witt
ChuChu DohDoh s younger sister and the strongest fighter for the resistance comes to warn that Papadoll has been abducting more villagers and is approaching their location fast
Papadoll soon arrives and the kids can t believe their eyes Their dog has been turned into a giant flying monster
DohDoh leaves Sandada with an ultimatum from Buburina If Sandada doesn t surrender before the next sunrise great disaster shall befall Banipal Witt
Meeko manages to get Papadoll to calm down but an interruption from Toriyasu sends Papadoll into a fit of rage
In the confusion Meeko is taken hostage and things begin to look grim
Some time later Sandada explains that when a creature from another world is touched by the sun twice they become what Papadoll has become
Expectedly Toriyasu freaks out demanding to go home but the others manage to reason with him because of the fact that he needs to save his sister
Meanwhile at the palace the prisoners attempt to break out
Meeko comes close but ends up trapped near the throne room
Listening in on a conversation between Buburina and her parents she finds out that Buburina s power is supposed to be a punishment that was cast by a wizard who sought revenge against her for sending his daughter to her death
Back at Sandada s manor Toriyasu are sent by Sandada to Buburina s palace to knock Papadoll out with a pill that contains sleeping powder that Sandada claims would make an animal like Papadoll sleep for a week and Papadoll s chain
Before leaving Sandada says that only Toriyasu has the power to turn Papadoll back to normal
Later that night Buburina calls an assembly to inform her prisoners of their fate
She tells her prisoners of her plan to create a giant mouse that would be used to wake the Sleeping Cat should anyone rebel against her sending Banipal Witt into turmoil
Meeko however ridicules Buburina s plan claiming that Papadoll wouldn t do that
Meeko demands the return of Papadoll and insults the princess by calling her a witch
Buburina having been upset by Meeko s insult tries to turn her into a balloon and pop her but finds she cannot
Realizing that Meeko is a human Buburina plans to make Meeko her new monster slave once the sun rises
She then turns all her prisoners into balloons and throws Meeko inside also
Under cover of night Toriyasu and the others prepare to sneak into the castle to free Papadoll and save Meeko
Unfortunately the plan goes awry as Toriyasu accidentally wakes Buburina up when the rope he is on slips setting off alarms all over the castle
Toriyasu and ChuChu make an escape while Suttoboke runs into DohDoh in an attempt to save Meeko
Quickly Toriyasu and ChuChu regroup in time to see Suttoboke and Meeko release the mouse balloon
With Buburina s plan falling apart at the seams DohDoh goes to try to kill Meeko and Suttoboke while Toriyasu and ChuChu go to try to get Papadoll under control and stop Buburina
In the ensuing air battle Toriyasu suffers through a temporary depression caused by DohDoh s taunting
DohDoh however is dealt a hard fate by karma as he breaks the mouse balloon when he gets too close to the castle and loses his hold on the Sorcerer s Arm
Toriyasu remembering what Master Sandada had said before he left regains faith in himself and tries to take Papadoll back
Buburina however refuses to give back Papadoll and nearly makes Toriyasu fall to his death after Buburina tears Papadoll s collar off
During his fall Papadoll finally remembers Toriyasu and Toriyasu remembers how much Papadoll means to him
Toriyasu then goes insane for only a few seconds before regaining composure after landing on one of Buburina s victims
Using the victim as a means of transportation he reaches Papadoll and regains control of him with ChuChu s help
However the signal tower goes off leaving Toriyasu and the others only a few seconds to save Meeko
Quickly they rescue Meeko and make it home
Buburina and DohDoh both end up with miserable fates Buburina is left sinking into a small lake and DohDoh tangled in what remains of the mouse balloon
Toriyasu and Meeko return to normal Toriyasu and ChuChu develop a relationship and the cats say that the two can visit any time and they can also choose to be cats again if they want
Before returning home Meeko makes a prediction that Buburina will make a comeback
The next morning Toriyasu and Meeko return to a normal life
Unbeknownst to the children Meeko is right again The cats go to Toriyasu and Meeko s school due to some urgent business that came up only recently leaving the movie on a cliffhanger

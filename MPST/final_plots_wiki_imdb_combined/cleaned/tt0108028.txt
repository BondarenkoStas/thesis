Sakay was a barber from Tondo Manila who joined Andres Bonifacio s revolutionary secret society Katipunan
He fought during the Philippine Revolution against Spain and later in the Philippine American War
Sakay remained in the field even after the capture of President Emilio Aguinaldo and the fall of the First Philippine Republic
He was captured but was released during an amnesty
Sakay then took to the mountains to revive the Katipunan together with Francisco Carreon Julian Montalan Cornelio Felizardo and other rebel leaders
He proclaims himself as General and President of the Tagalog Republic and engaged the United States Army and the Philippine Constabulary in guerrilla warfare
On occasion he was aided by talisman wearing cultist warriors
After years of fighting Sakay was convinced to surrender by Filipino labor leader Dr Dominador Gomez who argued that the establishment of a Philippine National Assembly instead of armed resistance presented the soundest option towards attaining Filipino independence
On the understanding that the America government offered amnesty Sakay and his officers came down from the mountains
However as a ruse they were invited to a reception in Cavite and arrested by the Americans
Tried and convicted for brigandage Sakay and Colonel Lucio de Vega were hanged while Montalan and others received life imprisonment

Plot Hotline Miami taking place in Miami in 1989 employs an unreliable narrator and events are sometimes presented out of chronological order
The player takes the role of an unnamed man dubbed Jacket by fans for his distinctive letterman jacket
One day Jacket receives a voicemail about a supposed delivery of cookies to his home
He finds a package outside which contains a rooster mask and instructions to perform a hit on a group of criminals and steal a briefcase in their possession threatening that he is being watched and that failure is not an option
After Jacket completes this mission he receives further messages on his answering machine each asking him to take care of an innocuous problem at a specific address these locations invariably contain a criminal operation usually run by the Russian mob that he must eliminate
Throughout the game Jacket has visions where he is confronted over his actions by three masked figures the cryptic rooster masked Richard the hostile owl masked Rasmus and the sympathetic horse masked Don Juan
During a raid on the estate of a movie producer Jacket rescues a woman who was being sexually abused and brings her home
In another mission Jacket is called to a phone company where he finds everyone dead except for a lone biker whom Jacket then kills
Jacket can find other animal masked killers dead or dying during his missions and after each mission he visits a store or restaurant where the same bearded clerk greets him
Beard gives him encouragement and free samples of merchandise
Jacket s perception of reality becomes increasingly surreal
He begins to see the talking corpses of his victims during his everyday life
Beard abruptly dies his bloody corpse remaining at his places of work and he is replaced by an abrasive bald man Richter who offers Jacket nothing
One day Jacket arrives home to find his girlfriend murdered and a man in a rat mask on his couch who shoots him in the head
The attack puts Jacket in a coma he wakes up in a hospital and overhears that his attacker is in police custody whereupon he escapes and storms Miami police headquarters
Jacket discovers his attacker was Richter who had also been following the orders of threatening voicemails and steals the file on the police s investigation of the killings
With this he raids the mob owned nightclub the calls were tracked to finding the address of the headquarters of Miami s Russian Mafia
Jacket then goes to this address and kills the syndicate s leaders
The game s main story ends with Jacket killing off the Russian Mafia s leaders but afterwards the player can play bonus levels as the Biker from the telephone company
Another recipient of the mysterious phonecalls the Biker has gotten fed up of carrying out their assignments and is trying to track the callers down
From raiding the phone company the Biker traces the calls to the mob owned nightclub and when Jacket arrives the Biker kills him
At the nightclub the Biker finds a hidden basement where two janitors have been sending out the mysterious phonecalls
If the player has found secret letters hidden in Jacket s levels the Biker will crack their computer s password and learn the janitors work for 50 Blessings an ostensibly peaceful patriotic organization and have been using its membership to carry out killings to derail an alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States
The Janitors boast their experiment is only the tip of the iceberg of a larger conspiracy
Without the password the janitors claim they were acting out of boredom and mock the Biker s attempt to rationalize his actions

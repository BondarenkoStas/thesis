In the summer of 1937 a dangerous gang of counterfeiters are transporting illegal money from the United States into Canada concealed inside frozen trout
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police assures the United States Treasury officials that they will cooperate fully in helping to apprehend the criminals
RCMP Constable MacDonald is sent out to assist in the investigation
While riding near Deer Lake he sees a suspicious Indian rowing a canoe
When he calls to him the Indian flees into the woods
MacDonald investigates the strange block of ice left behind and soon discovers the counterfeit money hidden inside the frozen trout
The Indian Pierre who works for the counterfeiters sees what has happened and kills MacDonald with a deadly throw of a knife
Meanwhile RCMP Sergeant Renfrew arrives with his men at the Deer River Annual Picnic where he competes against the Greek owner of the Totem Pole Lodge George Poulis to see who makes the best barbecue sauce
Renfrew meets nineteen year old American Virginia Bronson and invites her to join the picnic festivities and barbecue
Their fun is interrupted by news of the killing of Constable MacDonald
Later Inspector Newcomb challenges his men to do everything they can to bring the killers to justice
That night Renfrew comforts MacDonald s grieving family especially his son Tommy
At the Deer River Hotel Virginia returns to her room and finds Pierre who gives her a note from her father asking that she meet him at the Totem Pole Lodge
Unknown to her Virginia s father was tricked into coming to the lodge which is being used as a center of operations for the counterfeiters to provide new counterfeit plates for the gang
Bronson who was once a counterfeiter just returned from serving a five year sentence in prison
The next day while Virginia and Pierre are rowing to the lodge by canoe the Indian spots Renfrew following them
When he reaches for his rifle Virginia struggles to take away the gun and the two end up in the water
Renfrew jumps in after them and is able to rescue Virginia but Pierre manages to escape
While they dry off around a campfire Renfrew and Virginia get to know each other
While attracted to the Mountie Virginia discovers her father s picture in his possession and does not mention that he is staying at the Totem Pole Lodge
Later that night while Renfrew is asleep Pierre shows up and Virginia sneaks away with him to the lodge
Meanwhile her father is being forced to complete a set of counterfeit plates
He finally meets the head of the counterfeit gang the Greek lodge owner George Poulis
Meanwhile Pierre and Virginia make their way slowly to the lodge
On the road they re met by two of Poulis thugs and Virginia tells them they are being pursued by an officer named Renfrew
Shortly thereafter the two thugs encounter Renfrew and try to kill him but the Mountie and his trusted dog Lightning are able to disarm the criminals and arrest them
When Renfrew examines their new counterfeit bills he discovers a secret message from Bronson etched in the bill s design indicating that he is being held prisoner at the Totem Pole Lodge
Soon after Renfrew obtains an aircraft flies over the Totem Pole Lodge and parachutes down to the lodge property
Poulis is surprised to see his friend and offers him a room
Later when Renfrew sees suspicious men loading up a car with blocks of ice he chases after them on motorcycle
When the car crashes the Mountie discovers the frozen trout filled with counterfeit bills
Back at the lodge Renfrew and Poulis finally confront each other and in the ensuing gunfight Poulis is shot and taken under arrest
That night on moonlit Deer Lake Renfrew serenades Virginia in a canoe while his trusted dog Lightning looks on

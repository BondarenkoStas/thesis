Frank Drebin is honored at the White House where President George H W Bush announces that he will base his recommendation for the country s energy program on Dr Albert Meinheimer s advice at the National Press Club dinner the following week
The heads of the coal and oil and nuclear industries are apparently distressed by this fact as Dr Meinheimer is an advocate for renewable energy
Jane Spencer now working for Dr Meinheimer is working late at his research institute crying about Frank when she spots a man leaving in a red van
A maintenance worker emptying out garbage cans discovers a clock with dynamite attached and takes it to the security guards accidentally triggering it
The next morning Frank reacquaints himself with Jane as he interviews her about the explosion
He is shown around the institute and meets Jane s boyfriend Hexagon Oil executive Quentin Hapsburg of whom he becomes exceedingly jealous
Frank s boss Ed Hocken finds him and Jane at a lonely blues bar where Frank promptly blows another chance to make up with her
Meanwhile at a meeting of the energy industry leaders Hapsburg reveals that he has kidnapped Dr Meinheimer and found an exact double for him Earl Hacker who will give their recommendation to the President endorsing fossil and nuclear fuels
Police Squad tracks down the driver of the van Hector Savage and find him connected to a sex toy shop
Once he discovers the cops are onto him Hector holes up in a house demanding money
Frank then takes it upon himself to drive a SWAT tank into and through the house allowing Hector to escape and causing more damage when he loses control of the tank and crashes into the city zoo causing all of the animals to escape
Later that evening at a party Frank makes matters worse when he attempts to push the wheelchair bound doctor up to the front of the room
However in the encounter he notices that Dr Meinheimer did not remember him upon sight
Since Jane told him he had a photographic memory Frank confronts her with that at her home following the party
She refuses to believe him and dismisses him
Moments later Hector enters the house trying to kill Jane who spots and alerts Frank
After a tussle where Frank causes Hector s body to burst by sticking a fire hose in his mouth and turning it on full blast Frank confronts Jane again and she realizes that he was right
They then rekindle their romance
The next day Police Squad stakes out Hexagon Oil s headquarters where Dr Meinheimer is being held
Frank tries to go undercover into the building but instead is discovered and tied up by Quentin s henchmen
The rest of Police Squad is able to return after a snafu and free both Frank and Dr Meinheimer and head to the Press Club Dinner to try and intercept Earl
Finding their only way in locked Frank Ed Nordberg and Dr Meinheimer commandeer a mariachi band s costumes and head in stopping briefly to perform for the gathered crowd
After heading backstage Frank encounters Earl who attacks him
Several members of the Chicago Bears see this and begin attacking Frank not knowing he is not attacking a defenseless man
The confusion ends when Ed and Meinheimer take out Earl so the doctor can begin his speech
However due to the confusion Frank does not know that Earl has been eliminated and goes into the gathering assuming Dr Meinheimer is the fake one
After embarrassing himself for a few seconds Ed comes in to inform the audience that Quentin is the mastermind of the whole scam
However he has already left the room with Jane and after a shootout on the roof of the building Quentin informs Frank that he has one more trick up his sleeve he has rigged the building with a small nuclear device which will kill everyone in there except for him and render Dr Meinheimer s speech useless
As Frank gains the upper hand and is about to get the disarming code Ed enters and throws Quentin out a window
On his way down Quentin hits an awning and is able to come to the sidewalk unscathed but is immediately met by a lion and devoured
Frank frees Jane from being handcuffed to the bomb and they attempt to disarm it while Ed and Nordberg go back into the ballroom to evacuate it
After several failed attempts Frank finally manages to disarm the bomb at the last second by tripping over the power cord unplugging it
He is commended by the President who offers him a special post as head of the Federal Bureau of Police Squad
He declines instead asking Jane to marry him which she accepts
They go out to a balcony where they accept commendations from the crowd
Frank spins around and accidentally knocks Barbara Bush off onto the edge
She manages to hold on although in an attempt to help her Frank pulls off her dress

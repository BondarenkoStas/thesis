In 1885 while working as a correspondent at the offices of the Northern Star newspaper in India Rudyard Kipling is approached by a ragged seemingly crazed derelict who reveals himself to be his old acquaintance Peachey Carnehan
Peachy tells Kipling the story of how he and his comrade in arms Daniel Danny Dravot traveled to remote Kafiristan became gods and ultimately lost everything
Three years earlier Dravot and Carnehan had met Kipling under less than auspicious circumstances Carnehan a former Colour sergeant of the Queen s Own Royal Loyal Light Infantry pickpocketed Kiplings s pocketwatch but was forced to return it as he was a fellow Freemason
Carnehan claims to be an expert in whiskey women waistcoats and bills of fare
Both Dravot and Carnehan are in the process of blackmailing a local Rajah by posing as newspaper correspondents of The Northern Star newspaper which outrages the real correspondent
In order to save their lives Kipling has the local district commissioner detain both Dravot and Carnehan who obliquely blackmail the commissioner himself
Despite being accomplished gun smugglers swindlers fencers of stolen goods conmen and blackmailers both of them are bitter that after fighting to make India part of the British Empire they will have little to return home to except dead end jobs
Both Dravot and Carnehan turn up at Kipling s office and explain their biggest gamble yet feeling that India is too small for men such as themselves they intend to travel to Kafiristan a small and remote country in order to help a local king overcome his enemies overthrow him and become gods rulers themselves before stealing various riches and returning to England in triumph
After signing a contract pledging mutual loyalty and forswearing drink and women until they achieved their grandiose aims Peachy and Danny set off on an epic overland journey north beyond the Khyber Pass
Kipling after attempting to dissuade the men gives Dravot his masonic emblem as a token of brotherhood
Over the next few weeks Dravot and Carnehan travel through Afghanistan fighting off bandits blizzards and avalanches as they make their way into the unknown land of Kafiristan
They chance upon a Gurkha soldier who goes by the name Billy Fish the sole survivor of a missing mapping expedition sent several years earlier which had been lost in an avalanche
Billy speaks English as well as the local tongue
Acting as translator and interpreter of customs and manners he smooths the path of Dravot and Carnehan as they begin their rise offering their services as military advisors trainers and war leaders to the chief of the much raided village of Er Heb
Dravot and Carnehan muster a force to attack the villagers most hated enemy the Bashkai
During the battle Dravot is struck by an arrow but is unharmed leading the natives to believe that he is a god
In fact the arrow was stopped by a bandolier hidden beneath his clothing
As victory follows victory the defeated are recruited to join the swelling army
Finally nobody is left to stand in their way and they are summoned to the holy city of Sikandergul where the chief high priest Kafu Selim sets up a re enactment of the arrow incident to determine whether Dravot is a man or a god by seeing whether or not he bleeds
When Dravot flinches the monks grab him and open his shirt to stab him only to be stopped by Dravot s Masonic jewel
By coincidence the symbol on the jewel matches one known only to the highest holy man the symbol of Sikander who had conquered the country thousands of years before and promised to return
The holy men are convinced Dravot is the immortal son of Sikander
They hail him as king and lead the two men down to storerooms heaped with treasure that belonged to Sikander which now belongs to Dravot
As months pass Carnehan is anxious to leave with the treasure before winter arrives and closes the mountain passes
Dravot is against it however and develops delusions of grandeur
First Dravot suggests that Carnehan bow to him like the others ostensibly to keep up appearances in front of the natives and continue the deception
He adjudicates disputes among local people and villages and issues proclamations overseeing their administration
He begins making plans to turn the land into a modern country to the extent that he envisages eventually meeting Queen Victoria as an equal
Resigned that Dravot s mind is made up Carnehan decides to take as much loot as he can carry on a small mule train and leave alone
Meanwhile Dravot decides to take a wife after seeing the beautiful Roxanne despite Carnehan s strong warnings
Roxanne having a superstitious fear that she will burst into flames if she consorts with a god tries frantically to escape biting Dravot during the wedding ceremony
The bite draws blood and when everyone sees it they realize that Dravot is not a god but a man after all
The angry natives pursue Dravot and Carnehan
When it becomes clear that the battle is lost Dravot and Carnehan offer Billy a horse to escape but Billy refuses and wishes them luck before courageously charging into the mob with a kukri single handedly
Billy is killed amidst the mob and Dravot and Carnehan are soon captured
Dravot apologizes to Carnehan for spoiling their plans and Carnehan forgives him
Now resigned to his fate Dravot is forced to walk to the middle of a rope bridge over a deep gorge as the ropes are cut
Carnehan is crucified between two pine trees but he is cut down the next day when he survives the ordeal
Eventually he makes his way back to India but his mind has become unhinged by his sufferings
As Carnehan finishes his story he presents Kipling with Dravot s severed head still wearing its crown thereby confirming the tale

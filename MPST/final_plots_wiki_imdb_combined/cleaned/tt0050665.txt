On a stormy night Devendra an engineer drives down a hill road with his friend to fetch his wife and child from the railway station
A landslide blocks their path and the friends take shelter in an old mansion off the road
Devendra finds the house uncannily familiar
In the large front room he finds an old portrait which he recognises
His friend and the old caretaker join him and Devendra amidst flashes of memory from another life sits down to tell his story while the storm rages outside
Anand had come to Shyamnagar Timber Estate as its new manager
An artist in his spare time he roamed the hills and fell in love with Madhumati a tribal girl whose songs have haunted him from a distance
Anand s employer Ugra Narayan is a ruthless and arrogant man and as Anand refuses to bend down to him like others he incurs his wrath
Anand has enemies among his staff
Sent away on an errand he returns to find that Madhumati has disappeared
He learns that Madhumati had been taken to Ugra Narayan and confronts him but he is beaten unconscious by Ugra Narayan s men
While the men are taking Anand s body out of the palace they meet Madhumati s father who has to fight for his own daughter s death
He does it and wins but dies lying on the road while Charandas hides and takes Anand s body to the hospital
Anand s life is saved but his mind wanders
One day he meets a girl who looks exactly like Madhumati
She says she is Madhavi but Anand refuses to believe her and is beaten up by her companions when he tries to plead with her
Madhavi finds a sketch of Madhumati and realises he was speaking the truth
She takes the sketch and learns his story
Meanwhile Anand is haunted by the spirit of Madhumati who tells him that Ugra Narayan is her killer
He appeals to Madhavi to pose as Madhumati before Ugranarayan and help him get a confession out of him and she agrees
Returning to Ugranarayan s palace Anand begs permission to do a portrait of him
Next evening with a storm brewing outside Anand paints Ugra Narayan
At the stroke of eight Ugra Narayan sees the pretend Madhumati in front of him
Shaken he confesses the truth
The police waiting outside the room come and take him away
Anand suddenly realises that the questions Madhavi asked Ugra Narayan were things she could not have known as even Anand did not know such as where Madhumati was buried
Madhavi just smiles and moves towards the stairs
The real Madhavi dressed as Madhumati then rushes into the room
She is late for the car failed on the way
Anand realises it was Madhumati s ghost he had seen not Madhavi
He runs up to the terrace where the ghost beckons to him
Madhumati had fallen from the same terrace trying to escape Ugra Narayan
Anand follows the ghost falling to his own death
Devendra s story is over
But he says I finally did have Madhumati as my wife
In this life Radha
Just then news arrives that the train in which his wife was travelling has met with an accident
The road is cleared and they rush to the station
Devendra s wife Radha appears unhurt with her baby

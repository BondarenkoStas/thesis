On a camping trip in the Sierra Nevada mountains in central California a father and his two teenage children are exploring a cave when they experience an earthquake
After emerging they hear from a ranch hand who was outside that there was a bright solar flash prior to the earthquake
He soon falls ill and dies whereupon his body turns to a powdery substance
As the family comes down from the mountain to the nearest town they discover that everyone has turned to the powdery substance inside their clothing and there are few survivors
Most out of fear and survival are out for themselves but as they try to make their way home to Malibu they find two people that need their help as well as a man who invites them to be neighbors
They face dangers ranging from wild dogs who seem to have been driven mad from the solar flare to a gunman who steals their car
They rescue a woman and later a young boy whose family was killed by two men who stole their car
Besides the physical journey they struggle to overcome the emotional trauma of the events
They find their way home and find a note left for them by the mother
They are informed that a virus starting after the solar flare is responsible for most of the deaths and that some people have a genetic resistance
Jenny almost commits suicide by attempting to drown herself into the ocean waves until she is rescued
After initial grief they later continue with a hopeful outlook by moving into Northern California

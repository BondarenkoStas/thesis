One night an unidentified flying object appears on Earth and drops a strange green goo into a large pumpkin field
Farmer Jeb the eccentric owner of the patch comes outside to investigate but is taken by something off screen
Meanwhile Susan and her monster friends prepare for Halloween celebrations Missing Link practices scaring B O B
tries to decide what he will be for Halloween and Susan has a zombie cheerleader costume ready
Dr Cockroach however has no interest in Halloween because of a childhood trauma on that same night
Their prospect of Halloween is cut short when General Monger tells them that aliens have been detected in Modesto and orders them to investigate on the provision of a need to know basis
At Farmer Jeb s patch pumpkins are mysteriously being given away for free with one family taking the largest one
That night Susan and the monsters visit her parents who have prepared for Halloween eccentrically
The monsters investigate the suburbs for aliens while Susan investigates Farmer Jeb s patch
Doc uses his scanner on various people Link tries to scare people and B O B
has trouble remembering what to say when offered candy by an old lady who then gives Doc a swirly pop rekindling his interest in Halloween
At a house belonging to the family that bought the largest pumpkin from the pumpkin patch the pumpkin named Wicked Jack by the family s son comes to life and attacks the family
At the pumpkin patch Susan discovers that all the pumpkins from the patch have also come to life a result of saturation from the green goo that came from the UFO from earlier
All those in the suburbs come alive also and attack the children prompting Doc Link and B O B
to protect them
B O B being able to speak produce due to his mother being a tomato attempts to reason with the pumpkins but his attempt fails and Doc discovers that it s not the children they re after it s the candy
and that the more they ate the bigger the pumpkins would get until the whole world becomes their pumpkin patch
At that moment Wicked Jack emerges now a giant pumpkin and assumes leadership of the Mutant Pumpkins
B O B
s bungling leads the pumpkins to the Murphy house
The children and monsters rally against the aliens just as Susan turns up but Wicked Jack fuses himself with the other pumpkins to become an even bigger giant
The monsters attempts to defeat Wicked Jack seem to prove futile until Doc realizes from seeing B O B
suffering from indigestion that they must overfeed the pumpkins with candy to bloat them up
He helps by making a Gatling gun platform for that purpose
All the candy is eventually used up allowing Wicked Jack to recover
Doc realizes he must give up his swirly pop which he does to push Wicked Jack to indigestion
At that point Susan s parents come outside and are shocked to see the whole thing
Declaring that no one ruins a Murphy Halloween Susan sucker punches Wicked Jack s head off allowing him to escape until she whistles for Butteryflyosaurus to destroy him
All the candy that had been consumed by the pumpkins comes out unscathed including Doc s swirly pop which he gives to a young girl
Susan s parents also admit that they will have to get used to sharing her with the whole world
Unnoticed a surviving pumpkin tries to sneak away but is found by Link who scares it into exploding
General Monger arrives to congratulate the monsters as well
But in a twist ending some of the pumpkin blood saturates a planting of carrots causing a mutant carrot to be formed

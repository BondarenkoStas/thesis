A beaten and disoriented Nathan Drake awakes in a tattered train seat
He looks around the car in confusion then glances down to see a bullet wound in his stomach
His head rolls back as the pain hits him and he notices that snowflakes drifting outside the window appear to be falling sideways
Right on cue his seat jerks and violently detaches from its mounting hurtling him downwards through the vertical train car to hang above a dizzying drop After an agonising climb to safety above Nate lurches through the wreckage recalling the events that led him to this place Six months prior to the train crash Nate is found at a beachfront bar where he encounters Harry Flynn an old acquaintance and sometime partner in crime in the shadowy world of black market antiquities
The British thief has a client willing to pay a substantial sum for him to procure an item inside the Istanbul Palace Museum
Nate is skeptical knowing of two others who died at the hands of the museum s extensive and overzealous security force he himself barely escaped the building during a previous illicit out of hours visit Flynn insists that he requires Nate s assistance to make the theft and introduces a third conspirator Chloe Frazer an Australian he describes as an expert getaway driver
He explains that the commission is a clay oil lamp a seemingly unremarkable artifact inside the museum s Travel of Marco Polo exhibit
Nate initially dismisses the item as worthless and Flynn s benefactor a collector with more money than sense but an oblique revelation in a document written by Marco Polo changes his mind
Polo s fleet left China with 600 passengers aboard 14 ships loaded with treasure from the great Kublai Khan
It landed in Persia a year and a half later diminished to one vessel and 18 survivors
Polo documented every detail of the expedition but never disclosed the fate of the missing ships and travellers Nate speculates that the lamp contains a hidden message from Polo revealing the fate of his lost fleet undoubtedly laden with treasures of incalculable worth
Finding this the trio believe is the true purpose of Flynn s unusual assignment Chloe is the first to articulate what all three are thinking So we re dicking this guy over right
Nate is awakened in his hotel room by a knock at the door and opens it to find Chloe standing outside
The two are unbeknownst to Flynn intimately acquainted though we discover that Nate ended their previous relationship she bears him no rancor
When Chloe recognised the scope of Flynn s commission she decided that Nate would want to be involved
She suggests that they complete the heist find Polo s lost ships split the treasure three ways and then abandon Flynn to elope Nate Chloe and Flynn enter the sewer system beneath the Istanbul Palace Museum
Chloe departs to deactivate the floodlights illuminating the tower where the Polo exhibit is held leaving Nate and Flynn to infiltrate the main building After several close calls with the security personnel the duo reaches the exhibit
With an apology to its long dead owner Nate smashes the ceramic lamp to find a weathered scroll seemingly lacking any legible details and pieces of a strange residue
Flynn is distraught but Nate has a hunch
Identifying the substance as resin the latter lights a piece and the room is suffused with an eerie blue glow as it glows In this light the previously blank scroll is covered with Latin script and a map
Nate translating learns that Polo s fleet was hit by a tsunami and carried inland to rest beside a mountain somewhere on the west coast of Borneo
As Nate translates Polo s words attribute this misfortune to an unusual source It was as if the ocean itself sought to throw off the terrible cargo we carried from Sham bah lah the curse of the Cintamani
Nate is astonished My God Flynn Marco Polo found Shambhala
Shangri La
If they were carrying the Cintamani Stone it might still be there
As Nate prepares to follow Flynn out from the tower the former is betrayed
Left stranded in the exhibit Nate is helpless as Flynn shoots display cases triggering a cacophony of alarms
Claiming to simply want Nate out of the way for a time but clearly enjoying the upper hand Flynn chides his horrified partner You think I didn t know about the ships from the beginning
Any schoolboy could ve figured that out
Face it genius
You ve been played
Though Nate makes a valiant attempt to escape he is cornered and arrested by the Turkish police 3 months later we rejoin Nate in a filthy cramped cell and find him amusing himself with a shadow puppet recreation of Flynn s betrayal with a carthartic twist
As the Nate puppet draws a gun and shoots the Flynn puppet in a new fantasy denouement his show is interrupted by a shadow falling across the wall
He turns to find Victor Sullivan standing outside the bars the latter having arrived to bail out his old friend at great expense but is significantly less overjoyed to cast eyes on Chloe After convincing him of her innocence the Australian informs Nate that Flynn and his client Lazarovic have found Polo s lost ships in Borneo though they have yet to find the Cintamani Stone
This Buddhist holy grail as Chloe describes it is a perfect raw sapphire worth hundreds of millions of dollars Because Chloe possesses insider knowledge and unrestricted access to Lazarevic s camp through her continued association with Flynn the trio concoct a plan to snatch the treasure for themselves
Lazarevic has paid enormous sums to collect Polo s lesser known journals and has pursued the Cintamani Stone for many years
These documents Chloe tells Nate can be found in his command tent at the Borneo excavation site
She will engineer a diversion the rest is up to Nate and Sully In a swamp pockmarked with excavation sites the petrified remains of Polo s fleet protruding from their open graves Nate and Sully prime explosives laid at the camp s perimeter
Reconnoitering the command tent through binoculars Chloe s hidden microphone providing an audio feed they observe Goran Lazarevic a tall powerfully built Eastern European in black combat gear castigate Harry Flynn for his lack of progress then coldly execute an employee accused of theft Sully activates the detonator and a series of explosions rock the jungle to the south of the command tent
Lazarevic and his men pour out to investigate allowing Nate to slip into the headquarters
While Sully watches over him with a sniper rifle Nate ransacks the extensive collection of documents
He s impressed by what he finds Man this Lazarevic guy isn t screwing around Sully he enthuses
You should see all this stuff
He s got files on every expedition to find Shambhala all the way back to the 1600s
Reading a journal written by Marco Polo Nate learns that he truly believed the tsunami to be divine retribution for the dreadful cargo carried by his ships but that he purposely left the Cintamani Stone in Shambhala
He also writes of a golden passport a detail that Nate doesn t understand
Lazarevic Nate decides is seeking to retrace Polo s journey back to Shambhala When he learns that Lazarevic s men have failed to find a single body in the shipwrecks Nate intuits that the missing passengers must have fled to higher ground
Escaping the returning soldiers Nate and Sully climb the mountain that overlooks the camp Nate and Sully meet with Chloe at the entrance to a hidden mountain cave
Inside they encounter hundreds of skeletons with one salient detail leaping from the macabre scene each corpse has inexplicably blackened teeth Lighting a piece of resin and placing it in a torch Nate discovers the shadows of past slaughters there is blood everywhere
This the three speculate was the site of a massacre and the passengers appear to have killed each other
Following a bloody trail they reach a room in which a single skeleton clutches a lacquered box in its arms
Inside they find a Phurba a Tibetan ceremonial dagger
The cloth it is wrapped in is a crude map accompanied by a short message
Between Greater India and the province of Tibet Nate translates lies a field of exquisitely finished temples hundreds of gilded spires stretching as far as the eye can see
In all these many temples only one conceals the secret path to Shambhala and that path shall only be revealed to the pilgrim who bears the golden passport
At the last line Chloe raises the Phurba in acknowledgement it must be the golden passport
The field of temples Sully comments is now a city in Nepal
With their next destination settled the group departs but encounters Flynn accompanied by Lazarevic s soldiers
Chloe holds the protagonists at gunpoint and hurries to present Flynn with the map to conceal her subterfuge but artfully leaves the dagger in Nate s possession
After helping her friends to escape as they are escorted back to the camp Chloe tells Nate to meet her in Nepal Nate arrives in a war torn Nepalese city and is astonished by the devastation that awaits him
Chloe comments that the region has teetered on the brink of civil war for some time Lazarevic simply needed to fan the flames
In the ensuing chaos he and his army are tearing the city apart with near impunity as they seek the temple documented on the map found on Borneo After surviving fraught encounters with Lazarevic s mercenaries Nate is reunited with Chloe
He speculates that the emblem on the ceremonial dagger will correspond to another on the temple they seek they just need a high vantage point to scan the city
Chloe suggests a nearby hotel
After a perilous ascent to the roof of the ruined building Nate scours the urban sprawl and finds a temple marked with the symbol of the Cintamani Stone After a protracted battle with a helicopter gunship Nate is briefly separated from Chloe
As he walks through the side streets he is astonished to encounter Elena Fisher accompanied by her cameraman Jeff
She is in the region to obtain footage of Lazarevic who she describes as a fugitive war criminal who NATO erroneously believes to have perished in a bombing raid
She intuitively suspects that Nate is somehow caught up in these events despite his attempts to be evasive and then Chloe arrives confirming her suspicions Nate insists that they must escort Elena and Jeff to safety
Though amused by his discomfort at the meeting of the two women Chloe is extremely reluctant
You don t always have to play the bloody hero you know she remarks a little bitterly
Just dance with the one who brought you all right
Nate is intractable Yeah I get it he says with sincerity
Then firmly But they re still coming with us
As Lazarevic s forces attack once again the four fight their way across the ravaged city to arrive at the temple In the temple courtyard Elena questions Nate about his motives and he offers an honest account much to Chloe s annoyance
Elena is nonplussed So let me get this straight you re competing with a pyschopathic war criminal for a mythological gemstone
In turns amused incredulous and resigned as she listens to Nate s explanations Elena offers an insight into the brutal warlord s intentions This just doesn t add up Nate Lazarevic can t be after the money
He doesn t need it
You re missing something
Leaving the newcomers just inside the temple entrance the protagonists enter the main chamber where they find a massive statue perhaps the same wrathful deity depicted on the ceremonial dagger
Nate aligns four of its six hands into the correct position then experiences a brainwave the Phurba dagger is a key
Sliding its triangular blade into a slot on the statue s chest they unlock a hidden entrance As they enter the subterranean tunnels Nate notices a relief of a tree on a wall which he finds strangely incongruous
After some further exploration Nate opens a hidden shaft leading to a domed chamber
Placing the Phurba dagger in a slot Nate and Chloe gasps as the central floor area is revealed to be composed of thousands of tiny rods
These undulate and rise to form a relief map of a mountain range
A single beam of light from the roof above highlights a precise spot
Nate is excited Chloe I know where that is
On a map depicting a Himalayan mountain range stolen from Lazarevic s camp Nate compares the peaks and marks the correct spot with an X
At that moment Chloe s radio bursts to life with the chatter of Lazarevic s approaching forces causing her and Nate to fight their way back to the surface In the courtyard outside Nate finds Elena frightened but unharmed though Jeff is bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound
Chloe stridently insists that they can do nothing for him and that they make good their escape but Nate is resolute
With Lazarevic s forces swarming from all directions Nate half carries the dying cameraman as they flee from one skirmish to another The group reaches a dead end an apartment where the only exit is a 15 foot drop to the alley below that Jeff could not possibly survive
Nate gently props the cameraman against an overturned table
A panicked Chloe pleads with Nate to leave him behind to escape before it is too late and then they hear the sound of footsteps pounding up the stairs outside Chloe desperately levels her gun at Nate and Elena as Flynn bursts in flanked by mercenaries
A flicker of recognition registers on Flynn s face he finally understands Chloe s deception but nonetheless pulls her towards him
Nate and Elena outgunned drop their weapons
Flynn orders that Chloe be taken away to safety
As she leaves Lazarevic strides into the room The villian takes the Phurba dagger from Nate s belt regards it briefly then hands it to his burly lieutenant
His gaze alights on Jeff
Did you carry him all the way from the temple
he enquires
Nate remains silent
Shame intones Lazarevic flatly drawing a handgun to execute the cameraman with a single shot Nate attempts to bargain for Elena s life without him he tells Lazarevic the Serbian cannot find the entrance to Shambhala
A cursory search however reveals the map that Nate is carrying with his hastily scrawled X making a mockery of his attempted negotiation
Lazarevic strides from the room with both map and Phurba dagger in his possession leaving Flynn to kill the prisoners
As he gloats Elena seizes an opportunity and staggers him with a full blooded punch to the face
With Nate she leaps from the room into the alley below and both run for their lives After escaping their pursuers Nate and Elena take a moment to catch their breath
Nate reflects on Flynn s orders when Chloe was escorted away Take her to the train and surmises that Lazarevic s personal army must be heading for a nearby rail yard On arrival they observe Lazarevic s men loading gear into the cars of a waiting train and Flynn hustling a reluctant Chloe on board
The sheer numbers ranged against Nate and the sudden departure of the train forces abrupt improvisation
Riding in a 4x4 after a timely rescue by Elena they draw alongside the train allowing Nate to jump on board Steadily fighting his way over and through the speeding train Nate overcomes incredible odds to reach Chloe s car
There he encounters Lazarevic s right hand man and the two engage in a savage fistfight
After seemingly besting this brute of a man Nate retrieves the Phurba dagger from his belt then incautiously turns his back
The antagonist having swifty regained his wits grabs the exhausted Nate and begins to strangle him
A gunshot rings out and we see Chloe pistol raised as the henchman falls dead to the floor Nate stumbles towards his saviour then notes that her gun remains trained on him
Get off the train Nate she says quietly
I never asked for any of your bloody heroics
Chloe refuses to leave with Nate still angry for his earlier insistence on helping Elena and Jeff risking her life
Well good luck with Flynne
he barks angrily turning away
You two deserve each other
Nate s ire dissolves rapidly as he turns exasperated to reason with his old friend and sometime flame
As he begins to speak another shot rings out and Drake staggers from the impact
Chloe s eyes widen with horror as blood spreads across Nate s abdomen then Flynn steps forward from behind her gun raised
As the malign Brit pursues the gravely wounded Nate Chloe desperately attempts to forestall the killing shot
With soldiers arriving from the opposite direction Nate lies propped against a seat desperately scanning his surroundings for a means of escape
His eyes alight on a collection of propane tanks and with nothing to lose he fires The explosion rocks the train decoupling it from the cars containing Flynn Chloe and the main body of Lazarevic s forces
The forward section continues along the tracks while Nate s section derails
As the tumbling wreckage ploughs into a snow bank he blacks out Revisiting the opening scenes of the story Nate escapes the train car and retrieves the Phurba dagger
When Lazarevic s forces arrive to search for him Nate summons every last screed of willpower to defeat them then slumps into the snow
As his vision fades once again he sees the silhouette of a mysterious figure striding towards him Nate awakes on a bed in a cozy Tibetan house
Groaning as he attempts to sit upright he instinctively reaches for the wound on his stomach but finds it healed Though neither Nate nor his saviour Tenzin understand each other s language they infer meaning through gestures and tonality
The latter escorts the former through his village framed against the spectacular backdrop of the Himalayas
Inside another house he is reunited with Elena who throws her arms around him in relief
They are taken to meet Karl Schafer a German in his nineties but with the bearing of a much younger man clothed in traditional Tibetan attire
He greets Nate warmly
It appears you and I have much in common Mr Drake says Schafer
Seventy years ago I came here just like you carried into the village near death the last survivor of my company
I was hired to lead an expedition into Tibet to find the entrance to Shambhala
What they really wanted was the Cintamani Stone
Though Nate insists that he has no desire to continue his pursuit Schafer is powerfully persuasive Lazarevic must be stopped
Some of the most fearsome rulers through history have possessed only a fraction of the Cintamani Stone warns Schafer men like Tamerlane Genghis Khan
If a mere sliver could bestow such power what would a man become if he possessed the Stone itself
Nate is doubtful but Schafer insists that he accompanies Tenzin to the cave where the remains of his expedition can be found After a perilous climb through an ice cave high in the mountains Nate and Tenzin begin to find evidence of Schafer s expedition but fail to discover the proof that the German spoke of
Nevertheless deep inside the cave a hideous monster its apelike body covered in coarse hair a skeletal visage crowned by massive curled horns bowls Tenzin from its feet and roars revealing a mouth full of jagged teeth
Nate fires on the creature with a Luger pistol found on the corpse of a mummified long dead German
Though shot several times and stabbed by Tenzin the duo cannot kill the creature and succeed only in driving it away Further into the cavern they ascend a stone staircase to reach arcane ruins presumable belonging to a long lost civilisation
Tenzin and Nate activate massive ancient mechanisms as they travel through the imposing caverns eventually opening a secret chamber
Inside Nate finds several frozen bodies with a cursory examination revealing that each one died from a gunshot wound
They are all dressed in 1930s mountaineering garb
This Nate concludes is the final group from Schafer s expedition Tenzin finds a book
Its cover warped and stained with age depicts a tree in the shape of a T Tenzin taps it quizzically and Nate identifies it as the Tree of Life
Nate regards the chamber more closely and sees the Cintamani Stone everywhere each time held by a seemingly demonic figure somehow anointed and transformed by its power
Inside the book images depict powerful characters holding it aloft bathed in its aura as they lay waste to those who oppose them Realisation dawns Tenzin Schafer did this says Nate urgently
Schafer killed them
It was the only way to stop them
Bestial howls fill the cavern
Nate and Tenzin rush to escape to the surface as the unearthly creatures hunt them
As they look down to the valley below they see Tenzin s village in flames Back in the village Nate meets briefly with a panicked Elena then rushes to find Schafer and Tenzin s daughter
Aiding the villagers in their defense against Lazarevic s mercenaries as they search Nate and Tenzin work together to first evade then destroy a tank as it devastates the settlement
With the attack apparently repelled an overjoyed Tenzin is reunited with his daughter
However the reason for Lazarevic s sudden departure soon becomes clear he has claimed the Phurba dagger and taken Schafer hostage Nate and Elena leap into a truck to give chase they barely escape with their lives when an explosion sends their vehicle careening over a cliff edge
Viewing the road ahead through binoculars Nate sees Lazarevic with Schafer outside a long abandoned cliff side monastery Nate and Elena continue their pursuit tracking Lazarevic s company through the ancient monastery while eliminating or evading those left behind to stop them
They eventually find Schafer near death having been brutalised and abandoned by Lazarevic
Did you find my expedition
he rasps struggling to breathe
You understand what I had to do
If they had found the stone it would have changed the course of history
Schafer tells Nate that the monastery hides the secret path to Shambhala and with his final words pleads with him to stop Lazarevic then destroy the Cintamani Stone
Nate remains cynical but is swayed by the sheer force of the German s conviction
He believed it that s enough for me
Nate and Elena separate with the former pursuing the Phurba dagger and the latter seeks the hidden entrance
On his way to the dilapidated tower where Lazarevic Flynn and Chloe are located he observes scenes of slaughter as the horned beasts he encountered earlier massacre Lazarevic s men Entering the tower via a hole in the wall he eavesdrops as Lazarevic lambasts Flynn for failing to find the entrance
Fortuitously Flynn leaves to speak to Lazarevic as he stalks from the room leaving Chloe with the Phurba
As soon as the coast is clear Nate drops down to confront the Australian
Though reluctant How am I supposed to explain where it s gone
she surrenders the ceremonial blade to Nate Nate and Elena reconvene to open a secret entrance beneath a tree in the courtyard before entering the subterranean tunnels beneath the monastery
They arrive in a circular chamber but poised to open the entrance to Shambhala find themselves helpless to resist as Lazarevic and his men pour in
Though the villian attempts to toy with Nate engaging him to choose between rescuing Elena or Chloe Nate boldly strides forward to open the entrance adeptly defusing the situation In the caverns beyond the path lies open and then a mechanism activates rotating the stone bridge to prevent further passage
Nate is sent with Flynn to restore it to its previous position
The two trade barbed comments as they negotiate the hazardous tunnel hostility dripping from every insult and riposte
After realigning the bridge though they are forced to fight side by side as the horned monsters attack
Armed with just pistols they can only briefly deter the creatures from their relentless assaults but then Lazarevic enters and calmly kills them with powerful incendiary blasts from his shotgun Lazarevic strides over to a horned creature and grabs its jaw pulling its head back
All present are astonished as he rips a mask aside to reveal a human face it is a man clad in a costume his teeth stained black in the same manner as the skeletons encountered in Borneo
Scarecrows Lazarevic laughs to himself
Guardians to frighten trespassers
As Lazarevic s men open the gates to Shambhala they are greeted by an incredible vista
The valley is framed by snow capped peaks but the ancient city that lies in the basin is awash with verdant greenery The villian is satisfied but unmoved by the beauty he beholds
Though Flynn risks his life to rescue Chloe threatening to withdraw his support should she die the warlod rounds on Nate and Elena
But as Lazarevic brings his weapon to bear his murderous focus is disturbed by a sudden rain of arrows
Shouting and whooping in an indecipherable tongue a band of giant heavily muscled Guardians the men who outside occupied the horned suits pepper the crowd with their primitive weapons
In the unfolding chaos Chloe savagely elbows Flynn aside with a sharp blow to the nose then escapes with Nate and Elena to the city below The three push further into the ruins where Nate discovers pockets of the blue resin encountered throughout the journey
He identifies it as sap deposited by the tree roots when shot it creates a blinding flash causing nearby roots to retract After pinpointing their destination they fight their way to a distinct pyramidal temple in the distance Inside the temple they find the enormous Cintamani Stone set in a stone pillar resembling a tree
Nate immediately senses that something is wrong and then experiences a tumbling sequence of revelations
The Stone is not sapphire as Marco Polo believed but amber fossilised resin once tree sap Nate rushes outside his companions trailing behind in confusion
How could I have missed it
he berates himself
There s not actually a Stone it s the resin
The sap from the Tree of Life
And then they see it the tree in the courtyard below
Looking around it they realise that it has grown rampant with age its roots penetrating every part of the crumbling city They observe Lazarevic approaching the Tree of Life
Nate lowers his binoculars in shock as he intuits the warlord s intention
Oh my God the black teeth he exclaims
The black teeth on those Guardian things and the bodies in Borneo
They ate resin and it changed them somehow
A voice behind them causes them to spin as Flynn emerges from concealment
He is wounded bleeding profusely
He slides his back against a pillar to slump to a sitting position his strength waning
Elena rushes to his aid and attempts to reason with him but Flynn produces a grenade its pin removed
With a final parting quip he allows it to drop to the ground
Nate and Chloe are merely bowled over by the blast but Elena is badly injured Nate fights Lazarevic s men to clear a path for Chloe to carry Elena and the three reach a bridge leading to the exit
There Nate insists that Chloe escape with Elena and returns to confront Lazarevic Nate descends into the chamber beneath the Tree of Life the tree s roots descending as columns from above
At the center of the chamber below the main trunk is a pool of luminous azure sap Beside the pool stand Lazarevic and his remaining men
The warlod cups his hands into the liquid and drinks deeply
He becomes rigid as the elixir enters his body then relaxes
His eyes flash with a luminescent glow as Nate astonished watches the scars covering his face and arm spontaneously heal
Lazarevic looks thoughtful then calls out Drake
Sensing that the opportunity for a surprise attack is passing Nate pops out from cover and fires three rounds into Lazarevic s chest the latter flinching momentarily then shrugging off the inconsequential injuries
Desperation is followed by a flash of inspiration and Nate fires into the azure pool
It explodes in an eruption of blue white flames consuming Lazarevic and his men Spared the force of the blast Drake exhales in relief as he looks down at the broken corpses but Lazarevic s limbs begin to inexplicably twist and straighten
He rises unbowed and seemingly immortal With Lazarevic impervious to bullets Nate survives by shooting pockets of resin repeatedly engulfing his crazed adversary in blue flames as he is stalked through the chamber
In this protracted and vicious encounter the warlord appears more determined to brutalise and humiliate his opponent than kill him outright
As the battle reaches its climax the chamber ablaze as the Tree of Life enters its death throes Lazarevic slumps bloodied but defiant to his knees
He taunts his adversary to deliver the coup de grace but Nate declines then backs away carefully as the furious Guardians pour into the chamber tearing the warlord to shreds as they are consumed by the spreading fire As the Tree of Life dies the entire valley is convulsed by tremors as its roots retract pulling the city apart
Nate though bloodied and bruised makes a desperate sprint to safety
Reunited with Chloe and Elena the three survive a last encounter with an enraged Guardian before escaping to the monastery above Exhausted Nate lays Elena down gently and kneels beside her
She is pale and unconscious as the distraught Nate holds her close while Chloe looks on with grim sympathy
The scene fades Back in the Tibetan village Tenzin congratulates Nate his reply in his friend s tongue suggests that time has passed since the escape
Chloe approaches to stand with Nate and enquires if he truly loves Elena though it is clear she already knows the answer
Before he can reply we see the reporter still recovering from her injuries walking towards them supported by Sully Chloe takes her leave with a word of advice Just do yourself a favour cowboy tell her and walks away
She cannot however resist a parting shot
But admit it she calls playfully over her shoulder You re gonna miss this ass
After lamenting the lack of any riches to show for their escapade Sully sets off in pursuit of Chloe much to Nate and Elena s amusement
The two stare out over the beautiful Himalayan panorama and share a kiss
Elena asks on a scale of ten how scared Nate was that she would die
Four Nate replies Four
exclaims Elena
You were at least an eight
An eight
queries Nate doubtfully
Those Guardian things were an eight
Elena is mock horrified but curious What s a ten
Clowns confides Nate with a shrug Clowns
Over my death
exclaims Elena in disbelief
I I don t like clowns Nate admits with a trace of shame The scene fades to black as the two bicker playfully

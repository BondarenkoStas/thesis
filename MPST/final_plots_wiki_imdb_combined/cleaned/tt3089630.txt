Artemis Fowl II is the twelve year old prodigy who has dedicated his life to criminal activities
He leads the Fowl criminal empire which has been established by his family for generations
After significant research Artemis believes that he has confirmed the existence of fairies
He tracks down an alcoholic sprite posing as a healer in Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam and travels there with his bodyguard Butler to obtain from her The Book of the People the Fairy holy book that is written in Gnommish
Meanwhile Captain Holly Short of the Lower Elements Police is tracking a rogue troll that has managed to reach the surface of the Earth from Haven city thousands of feet underground
Assisted by the technically minded centaur Foaly and LEPrecon commander Julius Root she incapacitates the troll
Artemis decodes the Book using translating software and in the process learns the specifics of the ritual fairies use to replenish their magic take an acorn from an ancient oak tree near a bend in a river under the full moon and plant it elsewhere
Artemis and Butler track down 129 possible locations for the ritual and start a stakeout they discover Holly performing the ritual
Butler tranquilizes Holly with a hypodermic dart gun
A LEP retrieval team is sent to scout Fowl Manor
Using their shielding ability which allows them to vibrate faster than the human eye can follow the team enters the manor grounds
Artemis had anticipated this however and installed a camera with a high frames per second rate allowing him to detect the threat by freezing the image
After Butler incapacitates the intruders Root decides to lay siege to Fowl Manor using a time stop and enter negotiations
Artemis reveals the ransom demand one metric ton of 24 carat gold
Artemis also reveals his knowledge of the time stop and claims that he can escape it
An analysis by LEP behavior experts determines that Artemis is telling the truth
The attempts to gain entry to the manor continue as the LEP recruit an infamous criminal the kleptomaniac dwarf Mulch Diggums to break in
Fairies are forbidden from entering human dwellings without permission but Mulch has forfeited the magic preventing him from entering dwellings causing him to be safe when burglarizing
He tunnels underground to reach the house while Foaly feeds a loop to the manor surveillance system allowing Mulch to freely explore
Mulch accidentally locates a safe containing Artemis copy of the Book finally revealing to the fairies the source of Artemis knowledge which he had led them to believe he had acquired from a truth serum administered to Holly
The Fairy Council deciding that nothing is working promotes a lieutenant called Briar Cudgeon to Acting Commander temporarily usurping Julius Root
Meanwhile Holly Short cracks through the concrete of her cell finding fresh dirt and completes the ritual with a smuggled acorn
Having regained her magic she escapes into the main house
Cudgeon decides to release the troll Holly captured earlier into the mansion to force Artemis to allow the fairies to enter and subdue the troll
This backfires as Butler aided by Holly s healing powers defeats the troll
The Fairy Council subsequently strips Cudgeon of his post
Artemis is finally granted the ransom
The gold is sent in and Artemis asks Holly for a wish to cure his mother s insanity she has been living in her bedroom driven mad by the loss of her husband
Holly grants the wish at the cost of half the gold
The LEP decides to send in a blue rinse a biological bomb that kills all organic life to eliminate Artemis and allow for the retrieval of the gold but this fails when Artemis escapes the time stop by drugging himself and his comrades with sleeping pills
Having survived until the end of the time stop the LEP is bound by law and leaves the remaining gold and departs
At the end Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills
Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies and had guessed that time stops were the reason
Concluding that the time stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time stop is started Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time stop
Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly s magic

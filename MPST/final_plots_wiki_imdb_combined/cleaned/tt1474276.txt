Kenji Koiso is a young student at Kuonji High School with a gift for mathematics and a part time moderator in the massive computer simulated virtual reality world OZ along with his friend Takashi Sakuma
One day Kenji is invited by fellow Kuonji student Natsuki Shinohara to participate in the 90th birthday of her great grandmother Sakae Jinnouchi
After traveling to Sakae s estate in Ueda Natsuki introduces Kenji as her fianc√© to Sakae surprising them both
Kenji meets several of Natsuki s relatives and discovers that the Jinnouchis are descendants of a samurai who challenged the Tokugawa clan in 1615
He also meets Wabisuke Jinnouchi Natsuki s half great uncle and a computer expert who has been living in the United States since stealing the family fortune 10 years ago
Kenji receives an e mail with a mathematical code and cracks it
Love Machine an artificial intelligence written by Wabisuke uses Kenji s account and avatar to hack the infrastructure causing widespread damage
Kenji Sakuma and Natsuki s cousin Kazuma Ikezawa confront Love Machine
Love Machine defeats Kazuma s avatar King Kazma and continues to consume accounts in the OZ mainframe creating catastrophic traffic congestion and disabling electrical devices
Two of Sakae s relatives Rika and Shota Jinnouchi discover Kenji s involvement
Shota arrests Kenji but the congestion causes Natsuki to return them to the estate
Sakae calls associates in important positions in Japanese society and relatives who work in emergency services encouraging them to work their hardest to reduce chaos and damage comparing the situation to war
Kenji is able to return control of the mainframe to the moderators and engineers
Wabisuke explains that he sold the program to the United States Armed Forces for a test run
After an argument with Sakae Wabisuke leaves the estate
Sakae later encourages Kenji to take care of Natsuki during a Koi Koi match
The next morning Sakae is discovered dead by Kenji and the Jinnouchis
Her youngest son Mansaku explains that she had angina and that Love Machine had deactivated her heart monitor
Kenji Sakuma and most of the Jinnouchis initiate a plan to defeat Love Machine with a supercomputer using ice blocks as a coolant while Natsuki and the others prepare a funeral for Sakae
Kenji along with Sakuma and the others capture Love Machine but Shota carries the ice blocks to Sakae s body causing the supercomputer to overheat
Love Machine consumes King Kazma and redirects the Arawashi Asteroid Probe onto a collision course with a nuclear power plant
Meanwhile Natsuki discovers a will left by Sakae and reunites with Kenji and the rest of the group
Natsuki has Wabisuke return home before the family reads Sakae s will asking them to bring Wabisuke back to their lives
Realizing that Love Machine sees everything as a game Kenji has the Jinnouchis confront Love Machine to play Koi Koi in OZ s casino world wagering their accounts in a desperate attempt to stop Love Machine
Natsuki wins several rounds but gets distracted and nearly loses her winnings
However OZ users worldwide enter their own accounts into the wager on Natsuki s side which also prompts the guardian programs of OZ the blue and red whales known as John and Yoko to upgrade Natsuki s account
Natsuki wagers the 150 million avatars given to her in a single hand and critically damages Love Machine prompting the artificial intelligence to redirect the Arawashi towards Sakae s estate
Kenji attempts to break into the probe s GPS while Wabisuke disables Love Machine s defenses
After being revived and assisted by several of the Jinnouchi family s avatars King Kazma destroys Love Machine
Kenji activates the GPS code to redirect the Arawashi away from the estate destroying the estate s entrance and causing a geyser to erupt
In the aftermath the Jinnouchi family celebrating their victory as well as Sakae s birthday has Natsuki kiss Kenji after they confess their love to each other

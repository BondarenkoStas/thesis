A local woman named Marie takes him in as her tenant and becomes his lover
But when the Spanish guestworker Josepha comes to town Toni falls for her
To his disappointment Josepha has a wedding with a wealthier man

After Marie has thrown him out of her house he is determined to see Josepha again
He finds her on a farm in the mountains where she lives with her increasingly abusive husband
Josepha is about to run away and for that purpose she steals money from her spouse who catches and hits her
While Toni is around she kills the man
Toni sacrifices himself in order to cover up for her

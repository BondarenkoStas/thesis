Scrooge is counting money in the counting house of his firm when Bob Cratchit comes in wanting to borrow a lump of coal as he is freezing
Scrooge refuses and tells him to just work faster so he ll keep warm
Then Scrooge s nephew Fred comes in with Christmas decorations and mistletoe
He is tossed out and decides that somebody oughta teach that little humbug some Christmas spirit
Fred then borrows a piece of coal and places it in the office of Cratchit who graciously thanks him
However Scrooge s cat Sylvester notices this and warns him
Scrooge takes back the coal and fires Cratchit throwing him out along with carolers whom Fred let into the office
Cratchit invites Fred to dinner and introduces him to his youngest son Tiny Tim
Kinda puny isn t he
Bugs notes
If you had to live on birdseed you d be puny too
Tim retorts
Scrooge sends the light company to take the last candle and a notice that the house is being foreclosed forcing Cratchit to move out by midnight
Fred decides this is the last straw remarking Bugs s catchphrase Of course you realise this means war
First Fred annoys Scrooge with more carolers
When Scrooge goes out to deal with this he slips into a pile of snow
Next he puts snow into Scrooge s hot bath turning it ice cold as Scrooge jumps in
Fred then dresses up as a ghost specifically Scrooge s late business partner Jacob Marley
As Marley he drags around chains and beats a drum
Investigating Scrooge accidentally slips down the stairs and into the cold along with Sylvester
When they return to bed Marley reappears
Sylvester promptly flees slamming the door behind him and cutting off Scrooge
Marley threatens to take Scrooge to see the man in the red suit
Scrooge is promptly scared straight and promptly changes his ways for the better
To prove himself reformed he dresses up as Santa Claus and runs through the streets at night giving money to the poor widows orphans and the like
He also makes Bob Cratchit his new partner in the firm succeeding Marley
Tweety raises a toast to him and Fred kisses him
Scrooge still hates kissing though

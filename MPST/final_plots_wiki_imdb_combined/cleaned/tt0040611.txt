The cartoon opens with Mammy Two Shoes mopping the kitchen floor
After she finishes she is happy to have cleaned the entire house and hopes that it will remain clean unfortunately it doesn t as the camera cuts to Tom chasing Jerry outside rounding a corner too wide and through a mud puddle and then continuing the chase into the house
He runs into Mammy and she hits him with the mop chastises him for making such a huge mess and forces him to mop the floor
As Tom finishes Mammy prepares to go shopping
She warns Tom that he had better not make any more messes in the house or the whole neighborhood will lose one cat around here him
Tom nods his head in fright and Jerry hiding behind a broom also nods his head about to take stock of the situation for the purpose of sabotaging Tom s efforts
After Mammy closes the door Tom sticks his tongue out at her and makes a face but she opens the door and points her finger directly at Tom giving him a final warning that the place has to be clean or else
Tom then nods again and kisses her finger smiling politely and satisfied Mammy leaves
For the rest of the cartoon Jerry takes advantage of this conditional to torment the cat and to get him into trouble once and for all
Tom finishes the remainder of the cleaning
Feeling relieved Tom wipes the sweat off his forehead but he immediately has to clean this up in addition
A fly buzzes through the room and leaves dirt behind on one of the windows so Tom has to wipe the window down to boot
When he turns around he is shocked out of his wits to see Jerry deliberately scooping ashes from an ashtray onto the floor
Tom quickly grabs a broom and dustpan and cleans up the mess but no sooner has he finished doing so when Jerry is on the floor holding the ashtray like a parade drum and tripping the switch to dump more ashes onto the ground
Shocked and fed up Tom angrily hurls a tomato at Jerry who ducks as the tomato splatters into the wall which creates an even bigger mess for Tom to clean up
In apoplexy the cat collects a bucket and starts to clean the wall but he refuses to concentrate on the bucket and fails to spot Jerry deliberately emptying blue ink from an ink pen into the bucket
Midway through cleaning up the tomato Tom has created an identically sized mess of blue ink on the wall caused by Jerry and he realizes what has happened when he becomes aware that the water and towel are blue
In absolute dread the cat covers his eyes and slowly turns to peek at his new mess and then lifts his hand his eyes exaggeratedly pop out and his jaw drops
Soon Tom sees Jerry holding the ink pen and he starts a new chase in complete maniacal rage which quickly stops when the pesky mouse threatens to squirt ink over the drapes
Smirking he carries out this threat but no ink successfully escapes apparently the pen is empty
The cat delighted steals the pen and accidentally empties it onto the drapes
In horror he grabs the drapes and runs them through the washing machine the wringer and the iron
Exhausted the cat replaces the drapes and breathes out hoarsely
Shortly after this happens Jerry returns to his sabotage again this time he deliberately juggles six eggs while walking a tightrope forcing the cat to protect him in case he falls and eventually to catch the eggs when Jerry flings them across the room
In addition to juggling Tom is forced to catch a cream pie on a fork using only his head until he barely stands up
As the coup de grace Jerry deliberately pulls the rug from under Tom and although the cat recovers in time to snatch the egg carton and catch every egg in it he completely forgets about the pie which splatters onto his face
Having been humiliated again Tom searches for Jerry who soon opens the front door for an old horse to walk into the house
Tom scares Jerry back out of the house as he quickly grabs the horse and throws it out and while his enemy is occupied with this Jerry takes the opportunity to unknowingly re enter the house through an electrical outlet marked Emergency Entrance ready for another scheme
Tom goes to sleep having apparently gotten rid of all threats
Meanwhile Jerry pushes an ink stamp pad onto Tom s feet and hands and when the cat wakes up he shuts the pad on Tom s nose before the cat can process what he sees accordingly Tom forgets about the stamp pad and chases the mouse
Jerry leads Tom on an off screen chase through the entire house and when the duo finally pulls back into view Jerry stops the chase and points prompting the cat to look at the disgraceful gigantic mess of paw prints he now has to clean up
Looking at his now ink covered paws Tom makes the connection and picks up the mouse hurls him down the laundry chute and races to clean the house before Mammy returns
On the verge of finishing his cleaning job Tom sees a furious Mammy coming up the sidewalk he hurriedly finishes then stows the cleaning supplies behind the couch and sits down hopefully waiting impatiently for Mammy s return
Meanwhile a truck full of coal has come to the house to make a delivery but Jerry grabs a rope and ties it to the delivery chute
Jerry pulls the delivery chute up to the living room such that the entire shipment of coal literally barges into the house pushing Tom towards the front door and then knocking Mammy down the moment she opens it
As soon as she digs her head out from the coal she begins threatening to throttle Tom despite the utter impossibility of Tom being responsible for this new mess
Just then Tom emerges in blackface
Thinking that he is a black man with information on Tom Mammy asks him if he saw Tom
Tom knowing that he is in trouble now responds that he has not No Ma am
I ain t seen no cat around here
Uh uh
There are no cats no place no how
No MA AM
Tom meanwhile walks away from the coal pile but only his head is blackened so his ruse doesn t fool Mammy
Then Mammy begins to pelt pieces of coal angrily at him
He taunts her despite the fact that the last few pieces of coal barely missed him and tries to run away but soon Mammy throws another piece of coal into the distance and it ends up hitting Tom knocking him out in an identical fashion to Tee for Two as the cartoon ends

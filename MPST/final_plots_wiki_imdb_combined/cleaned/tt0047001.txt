The cartoon begins with an exterior shot of an elementary school classroom
Through the windows schoolchildren are visible at their desks
They are learning arithmetic by rote
The main character Ralph Phillips is bored with this lesson on seeing a bird outside he imagines that he is free to use his arms and legs to propel himself through the air
Miss Wallace interrupts this daydream and assigns Ralph to add a column of numbers on the blackboard
He is so intimidated that the numbers come to life and laugh at him
He fights back by doing the following 1
He removes the line above where the sum should be and the numbers collapse and uses that as a weapon against a 5 using a 4 as a sword
Ralph sticks the line into the 5
2
He then makes a bow and arrow out of a D and Y to destroy an 8
3
He then takes the dot from an i and j and loads them into the i
He uses the i as a weapon similar to a shotgun
Miss Wallace brings Ralph back to reality and sends him out to mail a letter
He responds by becoming a Pony Express courier who braves a horde of Indians across his desert journey
Back in the classroom he finds the geography lesson tedious until the sight of a fish in an aquarium triggers his next daydream as a deep sea diver who kills a shark and rescues an immobilized submarine that the shark was guarding before a tentacle from an octopus grabs him away which turns out to be Miss Wallace dragging Ralph into the corner for not paying attention during class
This however doesn t stop him from turning the classroom into a boxing ring where he knocks out the champ
The scene then segues into the classroom where the boxing ring bell turns out to be the classroom bell as everyone leaves for the day
On being sent home Ralph imagines himself as Douglas MacArthur and repeats the general s most famous line I shall return

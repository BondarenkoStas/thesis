Eom Joong ho is a dishonest ex detective turned pimp who is in financial trouble because two of his girls have gone missing
One night he sends Mi jin one of his few remaining girls to a customer
He then realizes that this is the same person who was the last to see his missing girls
Believing that this man is reselling his women he goes to look for Mi jin contacting his old police task force for help
But they cannot assist because the mayor of Seoul whom they are guarding has just been attacked
The police are now preoccupied with a media storm because they have suffered humiliation for failing to protect the mayor
Mi jin awakes tied up in a bathroom
Her customer Je Yeong min calmly informs her that a previous victim had her tongue cut out for screaming too much
He tries to torture her but she resists and Je Yeong min hurts his hand
Moments later callers from the local church arrive inquiring about its owner Mr Park
Yeong min has no time to finish off Mi jin so he invites the elderly couple in and butchers them
While trying to ditch the couple s car he collides with Joong ho s vehicle
Joong ho senses that the man is hiding something and calls the customer s cellphone establishing that this is the man he is looking for
Yeong min tries to run away but is caught and badly beaten by Joong ho
Both men are arrested by a suspicious local cop
At the station Yeong min casually admits that he has killed up to nine people
A fracas starts when competing divisions all want to investigate the high profile unsolved murders in the area
Despite his confession the police have no physical evidence so they cannot detain Yeong min
To get evidence Joong ho goes to Mi jin s apartment to collect DNA samples
In the apartment he discovers Eun ji Mi jin s daughter home alone
Reluctantly he takes her with him while he follows up a lead in Yeong min s home town
There he learns the suspect had been sent to prison for three years for lobotomizing his own nephew
Joong ho finds a shabby room where Yeong min had once lived
On the walls are a host of religious drawings
Eun ji wanders off following a woman who looks like her mother
Off camera she is apparently knocked down in a hit and run
After a frantic search Joong ho finds her and takes her to a hospital
He signs the forms as her father
Time has run out for the police
The prosecutor s office order that Yeong min be released because the police have no evidence
The prosecutor tells the chief that the arrest the suspect s injuries and rapid confession will be portrayed as the police s attempt to save face
To avoid political fallout Yeong min is released without charge
At the same time the chief orders the arrest of Joong ho as a scapegoat because he attacked the suspect
The former cop escapes from the police to continue looking for Mi jin
Meanwhile Mi jin has freed herself and escaped from the house and the garden full of human remains
Badly injured she finds help at a nearby corner shop
Yeong min stops at the same shop to buy cigarettes
The shopkeeper innocently tells him what has happened to Mi jin and that there is a maniac loose
He kills the shopowner before killing and decapitating Mi jin
Arriving shortly thereafter Joong ho finds the street cordoned off by the police and the store a bloodbath
The police now realizing that they have again been humiliated throw everything into the search for Yeong min
Joong ho distraught at what has happened visits the local church a link between the house callers and the car that Yeong min had been driving
Joong ho notices that the statue of the crucified Jesus matches the drawings he had seen in the room
Inquiries with the deacon lead him to the sculpture assistant who was staying at Mr Park s house
On arrival Joong ho discovers a now smartly dressed Yeong min carrying his bag of tools just about to depart
A massive fight ensues in which a fish tank containing Mi jin s head and body parts is smashed
Eventually Joong ho prevails but just as he is about to bring a hammer down on Yeong min s skull the police burst in and restrain the former policeman
As Joong ho is pushed face down to the ground he looks into the dead eyes of Mi jin
The police digs up Yeong min s many buried victims
The film ends with Joong ho sitting silently in the hospital room alongside Eun ji s bed
He takes her hand in his own

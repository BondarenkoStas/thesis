Heidi is an orphaned girl initially raised by her aunt Dete in Maienfeld Switzerland after the early deaths of her parents Tobias and Adelheid
Dete brings 5 year old Heidi to her paternal grandfather s house up the mountain from Dörfli
He has been at odds with the villagers and embittered against God for years and lives in seclusion on the alm
This has earned him the nickname Uncle Alp
He briefly resents Heidi s arrival but the girl s evident intelligence and cheerful yet unaffected demeanor soon earn his genuine if reserved affection
Heidi enthusiastically befriends her new neighbors young Peter the goatherd his mother Bridgget and his blind maternal grandmother
With each season that passes the mountaintop inhabitants grow more attached to Heidi
Three years later Dete returns to take Heidi to Frankfurt to be a hired lady s companion to a wealthy girl named Clara Sesemann who is regarded as an invalid
The girl is charmed by Heidi s simple friendliness and delights in all the funny mishaps brought about by Heidi s lack of experience with city life
However the Sesemanns strict housekeeper Fräulein Rottenmeier views the household disruptions as wanton misbehavior and places Heidi under more and more restraint
Soon Heidi becomes terribly homesick and grows alarmingly pale and thin
Her one diversion is learning to read and write motivated by her desire to go home and read to Peter s blind grandmother
Clara s paternal grandmother comes to visit the children and becomes a friend to Heidi
She teaches Heidi that she can always seek relief from misery by praying to God
After months pass the Frankfurt household is brought near hysteria by nightly sightings of what appears to be a ghost
When Clara s father and his friend the doctor keep awake one night to find out what is causing the disturbances they see that the ghost is actually just Heidi who s sleepwalking in her nightgown
The doctor sees that Heidi s under a great deal of stress
He warns Mr Sesemann that if Heidi is not sent home promptly she may become very ill
Soon a joyous Heidi returns to the mountains where she teaches her grandfather about the comfort of prayer
She reassures him that it s never too late to turn back to God
Her simple lesson prompts her grandfather to descend to the village and attend a church service for the first time in years marking an end to his seclusion
He s heartily welcomed back by the church pastor and the villagers
Heidi and Clara continue to keep in touch and exchange letters
A visit by the doctor to Heidi leads him to eagerly recommend that Clara visit Heidi
He feels assured that the fresh mountain air and the wholesome companionship will do her good
Clara makes the journey again the next season and spends a wonderful summer with Heidi and becomes stronger on goat s milk and fresh mountain air
But Peter who grows jealous of Heidi and Clara s friendship pushes her empty wheelchair down the mountain to its destruction
Without her wheelchair Clara has no choice but to learn to walk she attempts to do so and is gradually successful
Her grandmother and father are amazed and overcome with joy to see Clara walking again
The Sesemann family promises to provide permanent care for Heidi if there ever comes a time when her grandfather is no longer able to do so

The game begins in December 2000 with gangster Marcus Reed arriving at the home of an associate who has betrayed him
Reed had been placed in charge of the organized crime empire run by his father Isaiah The King Reed who has been in prison for fifteen years
As an attempted hit was carried out on Reed in New York someone stabbed Isaiah in jail
However both father and son survived and Reed now kills everyone who betrayed him
PDNY detective Terry Higgins then arrives on the scene
He is a close friend of Isaiah and Reed s godfather and he offers to cover up the killings on the condition that Reed gets his life together
Five years later Reed is now a PDNY officer working as a beat cop under the command of Lt Deena Dixon
However he has applied for and been accepted into the Organized Crime Unit run by Chief Victor Navarro where he is partnered with Higgins
On Reed s first night Higgins heads for a meeting at a warehouse telling Reed he doesn t need to know the details
Moments after Higgins enters the building it explodes killing Higgins
In the aftermath Navarro returns Reed to Dixon s command
She tells him he can keep his recently earned promotion and work plainclothes but is not to investigate Higgins death as Navarro wants the investigation to remain internal to OCU
Shortly thereafter Reed is contacted by FBI Special Agent Gabriel Whitting who informs him there is a mole in the OCU
Whitting believes Higgins was about to reveal the identity of the mole which is why he was killed
Prior to his death Higgins told Whitting to bring Reed into the investigation should anything happen
All Whitting knows about the mole is that they are in contact with four major crime organizations in Manhattan
Reed s first investigation is the Magdalena Cartel believed to be responsible for 75 of New York s cocaine trade
Higgins had made contact with socialite and philanthropist Teresa Castillo who he believed may be able to help him get inside the cartel
She gives Reed information leading him to the Magdalena safe house where he chases down their leader Rey
However Rey turns out to be head of the Latin Lords the main rival of the Magdalena Cartel the Cartel was using Reed to take out their competition
Reed discovers Teresa s real name is Magdalena Rojas and she runs the cartel
He arrests her but she tells him she doesn t know who the mole is only that as their information was always accurate she knows it is someone high up in the OCU
Reed next goes after the Palermo Mob
Whitting tells him that when the last Don was imprisoned in 1995 the mob went into decline
Recently however the remnants have begun to organize
Whitting believes a new Don has emerged but is unsure who it may be
Reed s investigation eventually leads to Vincent Tuzzi
When Reed interrogates him he says he never met the OCU mole all their business was conducted over the phone
All Tuzzi knows is that he has a Spanish accent
Reed next investigates the Presidents Club a gang run by five men using pseudonyms of former Presidents of the United States
They control the supply of a new drug called Pop a combination of ecstasy and cocaine
Four of the leaders call themselves Lincoln Hamilton Jackson and Grant
The overall leader is called Benjamin who takes ironic pride in the fact that Benjamin Franklin was never President
Whitting sends Reed to a drug den in Harlem run by Lincoln

Reed saves Kobi from a drive by shooting and kills Jackson
Kobi tells him Benjamin s real name is Lionel Jones a famed rapper and music producer
Reed heads to Jones factory arriving in time to see Kobi s men killed by Grant
Grant leads Reed to Jones building where Reed fights through Jones men to his zen garden on the roof seeing him kill Kobi

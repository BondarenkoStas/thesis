On June 27 1976 four terrorists belonging to a splinter group of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine under the orders of Wadie Haddad boarded and hijacked Flight 139 an Air France Airbus A300 in Athens Greece
Two of the terrorists are West Germans named Wilfried Boese and Halima and the other two are Palestinians
After landing to refuel in Libya the four hijackers force the airliner to take off once again
With President Idi Amin s permission the terrorists divert the airliner and its hostages to Entebbe Airport in Uganda
The hijackers are joined at Entebbe by more Palestinian militants
After identifying Israeli passengers the non Jewish passengers are freed while a series of demands are made including the release of 40 Palestinian militants held in Israel in exchange for the hostages
The Cabinet of Israel unwilling to give in to terrorist demands is faced with difficult decisions as their deliberations lead to a top secret military raid
This commando operation Operation Thunderbolt will be carried out over 2 500 miles from home and will take place on the Jewish Sabbath
While still negotiating with the terrorists who now numbered seven individuals the Israeli military prepared a group of Lockheed C 130 Hercules transports for the raid
The transports refuelled in Kenya before landing at Entebbe Airport under the cover of darkness
The commandos led by Brigadier General Dan Shomron had to contend with a large armed Ugandan military detachment and used a ruse to overcome the defenses
A black Mercedes limousine had been carried on board and was used to fool sentries that it was the official car that President Amin used on an impromptu visit to the airport
Nearly complete surprise was achieved but a firefight resulted ending with all seven terrorists and 45 Ugandan soldiers killed
The hostages were gathered together and most were quickly put on the idling C 130 aircraft
During the raid one commando brother of future Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and three of the hostages died
With 102 hostages aboard and on their way to freedom a group of Israeli commandos remained behind to destroy the Ugandan Air Force MiG 17 and MiG 21 fighters to prevent a retaliation
All the survivors of the attack force then joined in flying back to Israel via Nairobi and Sharm El Sheikh

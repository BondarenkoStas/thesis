New Orleans narcotics detective Anthony Stowe is a heroin addict who is teetering on the edge of oblivion and he could not care less
At the moment he is trying to bring down his former partner Gabriel Callahan who has become a drug kingpin
Callahan is trying to and slowly succeeding at taking over the New Orleans underworld
Stowe botches a sting operation against Callahan resulting in the death of fellow cop Maria Ronson whose fiancee fellow cop Van Huffel nearly comes to blows with him over it
Chief Mac Baylor has a very blunt chat with Stowe who is dismissive
Stowe is approached by fellow cop Walter Curry to help his nephew beat a drug dealing charge he instead turns Curry over to Baylor who fires him
After barricading himself in the station bathroom Walter confronts an unrepentant Stowe and condemns him for betraying his fellow officers
That night Stowe meets with his estranged wife Valerie who tells him that she s pregnant but that he s not the father
Valerie whose marriage with Stowe is close to collapse has been seeing a man named Mark Rossini the gym teacher at the school she is principal of
But he may not be the father either
Stowe brashly accuses Valerie of being impregnated by Callahan and she tells him she never wants to see him again
The only thing keeping Stowe from total collapse is his dogged pursuit of Callahan
But he drunkenly stumbles into an ambush masterminded by Callahan and is shot in the head by Callahan s right hand man Jimmy
Stowe undergoes emergency surgery and ends up in a coma

Seven months later Stowe is slowly learning to walk and speak again
He manages to survive an attempt on his life by someone who appears to be a cop
He attempts to get his job back but Chief Baylor refuses in light of discovering his heroin addiction
The coma has led to his decision to become a better man and to right some wrongs
He reconciles with his wife although awkwardly and gives Walter a significant portion of insurance money that compensated his time in a coma
Finally he visits the grave of fellow police officer Serge who once saved Stowe s life but has been killed by an unknown attacker following another failed sting operation
Valerie packs up to move out of the house so she can live with Mark but after realizing the change that Stowe has undergone she later decides to leave Mark and come home

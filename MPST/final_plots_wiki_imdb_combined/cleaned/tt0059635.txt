The story begins in the Russian countryside where Rasputin heals the sick wife of an innkeeper
When he is later hauled before an Orthodox bishop for his sexual immorality and violence the innkeeper springs to the monk s defense
Rasputin protests that he is sexually immoral because he likes to give God sins worth forgiving
He also claims to have healing powers in his hands and is unperturbed by the bishop s accusation that his power comes from Satan
Rasputin heads for St Petersburg where he forces his way into the home of Dr Zargo from where he begins his campaign to gain influence over the Tsarina
He manipulates one of the Tsarina s ladies in waiting Sonia whom he uses to satisfy his voracious sexual appetite and gain access to the Tsarina
He places her in a trance to injure the czar s heir Alexei so that Rasputin can be called to court to heal him
After this success he hypnotizes the Tsarina to replace her existing doctor with Zargo
However Rasputin s ruthless pursuit of wealth and prestige and increasing control over the royal household attracts opposition
Sonia s brother Peter enraged by Rasputin s seduction of his sister enlists the help of Ivan to bring about the monk s downfall
Peter in challenging the monk is horribly scarred by acid thrown in his face and suffers a lingering death
Tricking Rasputin into thinking his sister Vanessa is interested in him Ivan arranges a supposed meeting
However Zargo has poisoned the wine and chocolates which the Monk starts to consume
Soon Rasputin collapses but the poison is not enough to kill him
In the ensuing struggle between the three men Zargo is stabbed by Rasputin and quickly dies
Ivan manages to throw Rasputin out of the window to his death

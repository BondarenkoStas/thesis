During its raid on the fishing village of Cassardis a dragon approaches the hero of the story telling them that he or she depending on the choice of the player is the chosen one and proceeds to tear out their heart
Due to having their heart taken the hero is revived as an Arisen and is destined to find and kill the dragon that stole their heart
The Arisen proceeds to an encampment along the way to the capital Gran Soren
During their stay at the encampment a hydra attacks
The Arisen cuts off one of its heads and proceeds to the capital with the head to be presented as a gift to the duke of Gran Soren
After reaching Gran Soren and investigating a hole known as the Everfall the Arisen works for the Wyrm Hunt and proceeds to do various tasks including uncovering a cult known as Salvation who want the dragon known as Grigori to destroy the world
After working for the duke the Arisen is tasked with stopping the leader of Salvation Elysion who is attacking a castle
After reaching the top of the castle and defeating the attackers Grigori arrives and kills Elysion and it is revealed that Grigori has captured the Arisen s love interest
The Arisen arrives at the Tainted Mountain to fight Grigori and is presented with a choice to sacrifice the kidnapped love interest or to face the dragon
The Arisen fights the dragon and stabs it in the heart
The Arisen recovers their heart and goes back to Cassardis with his her beloved
After a few days of peace the Arisen treks back to Gran Soren
Along the way several details are revealed
The sky has been blotted out and replaced with greenish gray clouds that rain ash and all normal monsters have been replaced with much stronger versions
After the Arisen reaches Gran Soren it is revealed that half of it has collapsed leaving a gaping hole
The Arisen goes to meet the duke and is surprised to see that the duke has turned into a frail old man
It is revealed that the duke made a deal with Grigori to make himself immortal but without Grigori the deal is now forfeited
The duke attacks blaming the Arisen for his condition but he is swiftly beaten
Guards arrive and the duke accuses the Arisen of placing a curse on him and of making a deal with Grigori
The Arisen is then hunted by the guards
The Arisen is chased to the hole in the town where creatures begin to fly out of the hole with one bumping the Arisen into the hole
The hole is actually The Everfall a center for the strongest monsters in the world and a nexus that connects all worlds together
There the Arisen meets a pawn named Quince who tasks the Arisen with collecting 20 Wakestones to unlock a portal
After unlocking the portal the Arisen enters the portal and finds the Seneschal the mastermind behind the workings of the entire world
The Seneschal is a mysterious being covered in a glowing light and having two voices one a woman s and another a man s
After a short fight the Seneschal is revealed to have been Savan the knight at the beginning of the game who defied Grigori after entering the temple then chose to fight him and win
The Arisen and their main pawn fight Savan now known as the Seneschal and his pawn
In return for defeating the Seneschal he she takes Savan s place becoming a new fount of will to the world
Before dying Savan reveals information about being the Seneschal and tells the Arisen that he is not the only Arisen currently as there are multiple universes with their own respective pawns and Arisen
As a result he is only the Seneschal of this universe though it is a bitter reward as the Arisen cannot be seen by anyone in the world once they return from their throne
Using the Godsbane a sword granted to him by Grigori and Savan the Arisen stabs himself in the heart
The body of the Arisen and the main pawn are sent hurtling back to the world
The pawn wakes up on the beach and it is revealed by the change in his her voice that the pawn s form has changed into that of the Arisen
The pawn is then greeted by the Arisen s love interest and they walk along the beach to Cassardis

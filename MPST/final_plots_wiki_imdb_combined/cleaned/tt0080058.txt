Sometime in the distant future the planet Metropolis is a peaceful utopia led by a leader called The Great Brother
His world is threatened however by his brother Graal who has escaped from a prison satellite stolen a warship and enlisted the help of a mad scientist named Dr Kraspin
Kraspin has a plan to make Graal an army of unstoppable super soldiers he calls Humanoids but first he requires a powerful element to mutate them called Kapitron that is being kept at the Grovan Institute on Metropolis
Graal sends down a squad of soldiers to break into the institute and steal the Kapitron
They are also ordered to kill a woman named Barbara Gibson a scientist who once worked with Kraspin but who realized the horrendous potential of the element and had Kraspin committed to a mental control facility
Kraspin had escaped the facility two years earlier and seeks revenge against her
Barbara leaves before the slaughter when she is summoned home by her mysterious pupil a boy named Tom Tom who exhibits powers of mental suggestion
Tom Tom also communes periodically with two mysterious beings who he claims are foreign travelers
After the raid Graal returns to his hidden base on the planet Noxon where he is joined by Lady Agatha the world s tyrannical queen who hopes to share the rule of the galaxy as Graal s wife once he conquers Metropolis
Kraspin is also hiding there given asylum in exchange for keeping Agatha young and beautiful with daily injections of a youth serum he creates by sapping the life essence of female slaves
Once in possession of the Kapitron Kraspin selects the perfect specimen to test his mutation on and targets a bearded giant of a man named Golob
Kraspin forces Golob to crash his ship in a lake and Kraspin fires a small Kapitron missile which explodes turning Golob into a beardless raging hulk with superhuman strength
Witnessing the horror is Golob s robot dog companion Kip who sadly watches Kraspin capture and take his master away
After Kraspin fits Golob with a brain chip to control him Graal unleashes him upon Metropolis with orders to kill the Great Brother
Nick a Metropolis security officer tries to protect the Great Brother but Golob easily brushes off any armed forces that get in his way
As Golob approaches his primary target to destroy him Kraspin interrupts with new orders to go after Barbara Gibson first and Golob suddenly leaves
Golob tracks Barbara to her house but Tom Tom uses his powers to calm him down and removes the control chip
Golob now free of Kraspin s control becomes Tom Tom and Barbara s friend
With his humanity returning Golob tells Barbara that Graal and Kraspin are hiding on Noxon and she goes to inform Nick and The Great Brother
On her way however Barbara is captured by Graal s forces and taken back to his base
Tom Tom and Golob try to rescue her but are forced to retreat when Graal s soldiers open fire
The two are saved by the mysterious travelers who shoot the soldiers with glowing arrows
At the Metrolpolis command center Nick devises a plan to rescue Barbara with a commando raid but the Great Brother fears innocent people living on Noxon will be killed
Instead Golob says he will rescue Barbara himself
Nick joins him and he and Golob take a ship to Noxon
Along the way they discover Tom Tom stowing away and wanting to help
Nearing the planet their ship is attacked by Graal s fighters and crash lands
Near the crash site they encounter Kip who Golob excitedly remembers as his old companion
Kip then helps them sneak into Graal s base
Once inside the heroes discover Kraspin has a giant missile filled with Kapitron that he will explode over Metropolis and turn its population into mutant humanoids
Meanwhile Barbara is taken to Kraspin s laboratory and placed in a machine to extract her essence
Kraspin promises Lady Agatha that Barbara will provide the best youth serum yet but Barbara is saved last minute when Nick and Golob burst in and free her from the machine
Kraspin and Agatha then attempt to flee to Graal s ship
With Barbara s help and assistance from the mysterious travelers the heroes launch an attack on the missile launch bay
During the battle Agatha unable to get a dose of the youth serum collapses and dies when she rapidly ages into a skeleton
Nick chases Graal onto the bridge of his ship and faces off with him in a duel
Graal shoots lasers from his hands in defense and almost kills Nick suddenly Golob appears and crushes a control panel on his chest and Graal disappears
Kraspin is killed when Golob topples the launch pad of the Kapitron rocket
Golob then removes the Kapitron container from the missile which then launches across the bay and hits Graal s ship destroying it
With the whole facility exploding around them the heroes make their escape but without Golob
Tom Tom spots him running away with the Kapitron and jumping off a cliff into a lake
The lake explodes and the heroes fear Golob dead but he emerges from the water appearing bearded as he did before with the effects of the mutation having been reversed
The group briefly celebrates their reunion and victory over their enemy
Soon a mysterious translucent sailing ship appears in the sky piloted by the two travelers
Tom Tom tells Barbara that his mission is over and he must return home
Barbara asks who he really is and where he comes from
Tom Tom tells her he is returning to a land called Tibet in the ancient past but he will always be with her in her heart
Tom Tom is then seen departing on the ship as the movie ends

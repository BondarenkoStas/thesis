A short mild mannered man Mr Twiddle plays the congas in a nightclub jazz combo the incessant noise cause him to have nervous tremors and he leaves in the middle of the act while the rest of the band continues to play
Later his psychiatrist Dr I M Jittery tells him he is a very sick man suffering from trombonosis and recommends a relaxing trip to a quiet secluded locale to restore his nerves
The doctor warns Twiddle of the consequences of not doing so and has his wife make travel arrangements
Twiddle takes a plane to the Swiss Alps and checks in at the Hush Hush Lodge a mountaintop resort hotel which goes to great lengths to maintain absolute silence for its guests
A porter escorts Twiddle to his room communicating entirely with written cards
Twiddle changes into a nightshirt stubs his toe on an ottoman and settles in for a peaceful night s sleep
Meanwhile next door a pair of porters are moving another guest s belongings in ominously including a trombone
Soon the unseen neighbor begins playing waking Twiddle
While he unsuccessfully tries to shut out the noise a woman in the same room as the horn player starts laughing
Soon the musician a deep voiced man starts laughing as well
Twiddle repeatedly attempts to ask the neighbors to be quiet but is rudely and physically rebuffed each time he soon resorts to violent tactics himself but they backfire on him as well
The entire time the noisy neighbors are never seen except for an occasional hand
Eventually Twiddle s nerves give out on the verge of a nervous breakdown he begs the hotel s manager to find a doctor
He is quickly taken back upstairs to the room next to his own where the occupants are still laughing hysterically and playing the horn
Twiddle sees to his shock that his neighbors are Dr I M
Jittery and his wife nurse who have been unaware that their own patient was next door
Twiddle boils into an apoplectic rage as Dr Jittery reminds him of his nerves to no avail Twiddle explodes in a puff of black smoke
Dr Jittery sheepishly remarks to the camera people just won t listen to their doctor s advice
He and his wife then carry on laughing maniacally and honking on the trombone over the end title card

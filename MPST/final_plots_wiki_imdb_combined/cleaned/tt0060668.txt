Set in the historical Charenton Asylum Marat Sade is almost entirely a play within a play
The main story takes place on 13 July 1808 after the French Revolution the play directed by the Marquis de Sade within the story takes place during the Revolution in the middle of 1793 culminating in the assassination of Jean Paul Marat then quickly brings the audience up to date
The actors are the inmates of the asylum the nurses and supervisors occasionally step in to restore order
The bourgeois director of the hospital Coulmier supervises the performance accompanied by his wife and daughter
He is a supporter of the post revolutionary government led by Napoleon in place at the time of the production and believes the play he has organised to be an endorsement of his patriotic views
His patients however have other ideas and they make a habit of speaking lines he had attempted to suppress or deviating entirely into personal opinion
They as people who came out of the revolution no better than they went in are not entirely pleased with the course of events as they occurred
The Marquis de Sade the man after whom sadism is named did indeed direct performances in Charenton with other inmates there encouraged by Coulmier
De Sade is a main character in the play conducting many philosophical dialogues with Marat and observing the proceedings with sardonic amusement
He remains detached and cares little for practical politics and the inmates talk of right and justice he simply stands by as an observer and an advocate of his own nihilistic and individualist beliefs

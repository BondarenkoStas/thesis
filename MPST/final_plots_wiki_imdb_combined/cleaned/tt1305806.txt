Retiree Benjamín Espósito is having trouble getting started on his first novel
He pays a visit to the offices of Judge Irene Menéndez Hastings to tell her about his plans to recount the story of the Liliana Coloto case the one they both worked on 25 years before when Irene was his new department chief and he was the federal agent assigned to the case
Irene suggests that Benjamin start at the beginning
The beginning marks the discovery of Coloto s body raped and murdered in her home in 1974
Espósito promises her widower Ricardo Morales that the killer will do life for his crime
Morales states that he opposes the death penalty
Espósito s investigation is joined by his alcoholic friend and assistant Pablo Sandoval and the Cornell Law School educated Menéndez
Before the three can start their rival Romano tries to show them up by having officers beat a confession out of two innocent laborers who had been working near the couple s apartment
Espósito has the confessions overturned and lashes out at Romano in a justice building hall
Espósito threatens to file a complaint as Romano racially insults the construction workers
Back on the case Espósito notices that pictures from Coloto s home town of Chivilcoy frequently show a man named Isidoro Gómez whose eyes never leave her
Although Irene is skeptical Benjamín insists all of a young man s feeling for a woman is spoken there
Seeing that Gómez has disappeared Espósito and Sandoval travel to Chivilcoy and sneak into Gómez s mother s house where they find his letters to her
Sandoval steals them but they contain nothing useful and when their supervising judge learns of the illegal action the case is closed
Over an evening review of the manuscript Benjamín reminds Irene that it was only one week later that she announced her engagement
He also recalls backing out of a conversation with her in which he was about to shut the door
The memory is poignant and Irene decides that she cannot revisit the past through his novel anymore
The case is reopened after a year when Espósito sees that Morales maintains daily surveillance of Buenos Aires railway stations looking for Gómez
After receiving Menéndez s approval Sandoval studies the letters and notices references to the players of Racing Football Club in Buenos Aires
Espósito and Sandoval attend four matches of Racing until they are able to spot Gómez in the crowd
Gómez leads the police through a chase before being arrested
Menéndez is able to break Gómez by making taunting remarks about him being too weak to commit the crime
Feeling emasculated Gómez exposes his penis and shouts a confession
In 1975 the widower sees his wife s killer on television included in a security detail for the president of Argentina María Estela Martínez de Perón
Menéndez and Espósito quickly establish that Romano now working for a government intelligence agency released the murderer out of spite
Romano claims that Gómez has violent talents that should be used to combat left wing guerrillas instead of being squandered in prison
Romano insults them both taunting Espósito for being beneath Menéndez
Undeterred she later invites Espósito to offer his objections to her impending marriage plans later that night
Before they can meet however he has to leave a very intoxicated Sandoval in his living room to fetch his wife
When they return they find Sandoval murdered
Espósito assumes he was the target of either Romano or Gómez and accepts the remote isolation of Jujuy Province
Late one night while contemplating the sacrifice of his lost friend Pablo Benjamín gets a call from Irene asking to see the rest of his book
Menéndez takes him to the train station for a disconsolate goodbye
When Irene finishes reading she and Benjamin still seek inspiration for a suitable ending
They are able to locate Ricardo Morales leading a quiet life in a rural area of Buenos Aires Province
Although the widower apparently has relinquished his obsession with the murder case Benjamín has to ask him how he has lived without the love of his life for 25 years
When Benjamín repeats Pablo s final promise to get Isidoro Ricardo hesitantly confesses that in 1975 he kidnapped Isidoro and shot him dead
Feeling that something is not right Benjamín follows Ricardo to a small building near the main house where he is shocked to find Isidoro living in a makeshift cell undetectable from the outside
Isidoro begs for human contact and Ricardo reminds Benjamín of his promise that Isidoro would never go free
Benjamín pays his respects at Pablo s grave then goes to see Irene with an evident sense of purpose
She notices something different in his eyes reminds him that it will be complicated and asks him to close the door

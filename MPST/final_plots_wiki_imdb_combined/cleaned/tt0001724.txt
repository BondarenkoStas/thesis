Publicity and preproduction The Last Drop of Water was promoted as having extras well above 200 to show the detail and money going into the Western
The Biograph Company was heavily promoting the film at one of the highest state of production within the film industry of its day trying to prove its modernity in the state of change within the film industry
This is considered to be Griffith s way of continuing his career since the Western by this time was losing popularity this was his late break into the Western genre
The title of the film changed from In a Wagon Train Going Westward in the 1800s but was changed prior to the film s release date
California had a variety of environments that were used within the film it was starting to become popular with filmmakers because of the access to natural and various landscapes
Themes The whole film is an allusion to the life of Sir Philip Sydney and his martyred death of giving all his resources as he lay dying on the battlefield this reference is given during the first inter title of the movie
White actors did redface in this film to portray American Indians as savages and continued the stereotype of the aggressive savage as well as the tumultuous relations with the tribes in the West as white Americans were immigrating towards California indicative of manifest destiny
This film was the precursor to a later film The Covered Wagon which The Western from silents to cinerama describes both films as having the same poetry though Griffith s film is more exciting because of his use of cross cutting to accentuate the action in The Last Drop of Water
It is also one of Griffith s films where plot and action are on the same level as opposed to a focus on the action of film

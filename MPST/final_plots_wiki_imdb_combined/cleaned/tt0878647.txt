Agent Neil Shaw who has returned to working for the United Nations assassinates an arms dealer in downtown Los Angeles and also kills a suicide bomber who was there as part of an unrelated plot but is reprimanded by his superior Gaines for his indiscreetness in doing so
Shaw is nonetheless sent on a mission to South Korea which is a few days away from a peaceful reunion with North Korea though the process is threatened by North Korean separatists who are rumored to be buying a nuclear weapon from Russian arms dealers
The mission quickly goes wrong when one of the two agents under Shaw s command is spotted and shot dead by a sniper resulting in a firefight in which Shaw finds a woman named Sun Yi with the arms dealers he considers her to be out of place and captures her in order to get answers out of her though the second agent under Shaw s command is also killed as they leave the scene
Shaw and his remaining agent Jason attempt to interrogate Sun Yi but find that she knows nothing of importance
Shaw then tries to contact Gaines who has just arrived in South Korea but men working for the arms dealer intercept and kill Gaines and plant evidence to frame Shaw for his murder
Shortly afterwards Kim one of the men at the earlier meeting arrives with several men under his command leading to a firefight in which Shaw kills two of Kim s men before he Jason and Sun Yi escape the scene
After getting to a hotel in the local red light district Shaw concludes over Jason s objections that the best course of action is to break into Seoul s United Nations branch and personally appeal to the Secretary General
That night Shaw and Sun Yi make love but are interrupted by the arrival of more armed men who Shaw is forced to kill
The following day Shaw and Sun Yi enter the United Nations building in disguise with Jason providing surveillance
Before they go into the building however Sun Yi knowingly gives Jason s location away to some waiting assassins and while he s ultimately able to fend off their attack they destroy the equipment in the van forcing Jason to follow Shaw and Sun Yi into the building
After fighting off the security guards Shaw and Sun Yi get to the Secretary General s office and are surprised to find that Kim is there along with the Secretary General the South Korean ambassador and several guards
Kim reveals that he is actually a Secret Service agent who has been working with the United Nations to track down the arms dealer who in reality is none other than Sun Yi
On having her cover blown Sun Yi grabs Shaw s gun and quickly kills everyone in the room except for Shaw and the Secretary General
This leads to a gunfight in which Shaw and Sun Yi unsuccessfully try to kill each other before Jason enters and distracts Sun Yi long enough for Shaw to incapacitate her
Disillusioned by the recent events Shaw tells the Secretary General that he s leaving the United Nations employ this time for good but she refuses to allow him to do so saying that he s far too valuable an asset

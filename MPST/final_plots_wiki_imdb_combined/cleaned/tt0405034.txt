Ico a horned boy is taken by a group of warriors to an abandoned castle and locked inside a stone coffin to be sacrificed
A tremor topples the coffin and Ico escapes
As he searches the castle he comes across Yorda a captive girl who speaks a different language
Ico helps Yorda escape and defends her from shadow like creatures
The pair makes their way through the castle and arrive at the bridge leading to land
As they cross the Queen ruler of the castle appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle
Later as they try to escape on the bridge it slips up and they get separated
Yorda tries to save Ico but the Queen prevents it
He ends up falling off the bridge and losing consciousness
Ico awakens below the castle and makes his way back to the upper levels finding a magic sword that dispels the shadow creatures
After discovering that Yorda has been turned to stone by the Queen he confronts the Queen in her throne room who reveals that she plans to restart her life anew by taking possession of Yorda s body
Ico slays the Queen with the magic sword but his horns are broken in the fight and at the end of it he is knocked unconscious
With Queen s death the castle begins to collapse around Ico but the Queen s spell on Yorda is broken and a shadowy Yorda carries Ico safely out of the castle to a boat sending him to drift to the shore alone
Ico awakens to find the distant castle in ruins and Yorda in her human form washed up nearby

After the milkman delivers two milk bottles Tom eagerly snatches one and pours it out to drink but is met by Jerry who also wants the milk
Tom tries three times to lock Jerry in a room to keep him away from the milk but each time Jerry manages to keep sipping the milk
Tom then plots how to get rid of Jerry so he can drink milk in peace
Tom mixes chemicals such as moth balls acid ammonia and poison into milk to create a deadly elixir and stirs it with a spoon until it melts in the formula
After a fly takes a sip from the bowl and immediately drops dead Tom delighted places the bowl outside Jerry s hole confident will he fall for his new trick
Jerry seemingly drops dead just as the fly did but instead then rattles and pops around
When the effects stop Jerry becomes incredibly muscular and starts advancing on a nervous Tom
After Tom unsuccessfully tries to stop Jerry with a phone book and fireplace poker he attempts to lock himself in the living room but Jerry tears the door down
Tom then seals himself inside a wall safe but Jerry easily drills through and pulls him out
As Jerry starts smacking Tom against the safe however the potion s effects wear off and Jerry returns to his normal size
Jerry then swiftly runs for the milk bowl and manages to drink the potion again before Tom grabs him
Jerry with his reactivated power grabs Tom by the whiskers and starts thrashing him around mercilessly
However the elixir very quickly wears off
Tom quickly upends all the milk from the bowl before Jerry can drink it for a third time and chases Jerry across the kitchen
Jerry manages to put Tom s tail inside a waffle iron and flee into the fridge
Jerry then locks Tom inside the fridge and attempts to recreate the elixir before Tom can opens his way out from the fridge
Tom then steals the elixir from Jerry and holds Jerry next to him as he drinks it
Tom grows larger and larger but it turns out that Jerry had incorrectly made the elixir and the opposite effect occurs to Tom as he shrinks to a smaller size than Jerry
Delighted with his now superior strength to Tom Jerry grabs Tom s tail before punching him in the face and snapping Tom s tail to make Tom shrink even further
With Tom now the size of an ant he is forced to flee as Jerry starts to chase him with a flyswatter

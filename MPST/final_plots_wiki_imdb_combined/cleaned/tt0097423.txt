Maxwell Smart acting as a protocol officer since CONTROL was disbanded in the early 1970s is reactivated as a counterintelligence agent by Commander Drury of the United States Intelligence Agency
KAOS long considered defunct has been revitalized by a corporate takeover
Its first scheme involves turning a forgotten American scientist and using his weather control machine to extort US 250 billion from the United States Government
Drury convinced that only Smart has the expertise to combat KAOS gives him carte blanche to reactivate former CONTROL agents to assist him in his task
Along with Drury s bumbling aide Beamish Smart recruits Larrabee Agent 13 Hymie the Robot and ultimately his wife 99 to find the security leak that allowed the scientist to defect locate the weather machine and disarm it
They are opposed by a KAOS mole within the USIA who is able to predict Max s every move with the aid of stolen copies of 99 s unpublished memoirs
The visible head of the KAOS scheme is revealed to be Max s old nemesis Siegfried but he is merely the agent of a higher executive whom even he has never met
This new leader is finally revealed as Nicholas Demente 99 s publisher who intends not only to extort the money but also to create weather that will keep people eternally indoors and interfere with television reception forcing millions of Americans to entertain themselves by buying Demente s books and publications
Max 99 and Beamish infiltrate KAOS with the aide of Siegfried s twin brother Doctor Helmut Schmelding
After defeating Demente s henchmen with medieval weaponry the CONTROL agents kill Demente with his own weather machine
Max and 99 celebrate by causing it to snow

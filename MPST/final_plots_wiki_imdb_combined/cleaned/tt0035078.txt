Geoffrey Wolfe a writer similar to Maugham tells the story of Charles Strickland
A mediocre seemingly unassuming London stockbroker Strickland suddenly gives up his career wife of 17 years and children and moves to Paris
Mrs Strickland asks Wolfe to bring him back
To Wolfe s surprise Strickland has not run away with another woman but because Strickland feels compelled to become a painter
He exhibits no remorse or shame about abandoning his family and refuses to return to his old life whereupon his wife divorces him
Despite his strong disapproval of Strickland s callous behavior Wolfe is intrigued
Several years later Wolfe is in Paris to see his friend kindhearted Dirk Stroeve
Stroeve is a bad painter but an astute judge of others talent
When Wolfe asks if he knows Strickland he confidently states that the man is a great painter even though he has not sold any of his work and barely ekes out a living with odd jobs
However Stroeve s beloved wife Blanche loathes the man
Finding Strickland seriously ill near Christmas Stroeve persuades a very reluctant Blanche to take him into their happy home promising to nurse him back to health by himself
After six weeks the artist recovers and makes himself at home even evicting his host from his own studio
When Stroeve asks him to leave Blanche unexpectedly announces she is going with him
Stroeve first tries to throttle Strickland
Then after regaining his composure he gives the couple the apartment and departs himself
Later Strickland discards Blanche and she commits suicide
Even after all this Stroeve offers to put Strickland up at his mother s home in Holland
He declines
Wolfe travels to Tahiti where he learns of Strickland s fate from Captain Nichols and Tiara Johnson
Tiara had arranged a match between Strickland and her young infatuated cousin Ata
They marry live happily on Ata s property and have a child
Strickland paints as much as he wants
Then Dr Coutras is sent for
He informs Strickland he has contracted leprosy
Ata refuses to leave him braving the hostility of their neighbors though she eventually entrusts their child to others
Two years later Coutras is summoned again
He is too late Strickland is dead
Entering the now dilapidated house Coutras is awestruck by the paintings adorning all of the interior recognizing despite his lack of knowledge of art that Strickland has created masterpieces
Ata however burns the house down fulfilling a promise extracted by her husband

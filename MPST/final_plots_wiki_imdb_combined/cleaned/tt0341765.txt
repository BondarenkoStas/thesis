It all started some years ago when a culinary confused king asked a question to his chefs
Which would be stronger tofu surprise or stuffed duck
The king s chefs thought the king had gone a little too heavy on the nutmeg
One mysterious chef knew what the king was talking about and presented him with magical cards called Meal Tickets which turns the food into monsters called Fighting Foodons
Since that day regular food recipes have been turned into Foodons when the art of culinary combat is concocted
One day King Gorgeous Gorge and his Gluttons cook up a devious plan to rule the world and they sprinkled an extra dash of destruction
They plan to rule the world by kidnapping the best chefs forcing them to make powerful evil Foodons
A boy named Chase a young apprentice chef with an appetite for action thinks he has what it takes to become an Elite Master Chef like his dad Chef Jack
Zen believes that he his friends family and Foodons can change the world one at a time even if it involves going into battle against the Glutton Gormandizers King Gorge s Big 4 and King Gorge s female cat like servant Clawdia
Then he d have a final showdown with King Gorge

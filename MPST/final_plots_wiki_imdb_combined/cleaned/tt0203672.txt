The story begins in early Republican China
After passing a test Hero Hua is accepted by Pride a master swordsman as his second apprentice
When he returns home he is horrified to see that his parents have been murdered by foreigners for opposing the opium trade
That night Hero breaks up the foreigners party and kills them in revenge
He spends the rest of the night with his lover Jade
The next morning he flees from China to avoid arrest and sails to America
16 years later Hero s childhood friend Sheng and Hero s son Sword Hua arrive in New York City on the first day of the Chinese New Year
They visit China House the biggest inn in Chinatown where they see a lion dance performance led by the Boss of China House
A group of thugs show up and demand that the Boss hand over a monk Luohan whom they believe is hiding in China House
After defeating and driving away the thugs the Boss brings Sword and Sheng to meet Luohan
Luohan tells them how he met and befriended Hero on board the ship bound for America and their experiences as labourers in Steel Bull Canyon
Later Sword and Sheng visit Jade s grave where Sheng tells Sword how he and Jade travelled to New York City 16 years ago in search of Hero
Hero and Jade were reunited and married in New York City
While visiting the shop where Sword s parents took their wedding photographs Sword and Sheng sense someone following them
Sword surprises the stalker and corners her after a brief chase through the streets
She identifies herself as Kate the daughter of Hero s senior Shadow
Kate leads Sword and Sheng to her father
Shadow tells them how he rescued Hero from Steel Bull Canyon when Hero was buried in the sand after being falsely accused of murdering two men
Hero and Shadow encountered the Five Elements Ninjas and defeated them
During the fight Hero injured the female ninja Wood but spared her life and sent her for medical treatment
When Wood develops a crush on Hero the Gold Ninja who is secretly in love with Wood becomes very jealous
Jade had just given birth to a pair of twins in China House when the Gold Ninja set fire to the building
During the chaos Bigot a traitor kidnapped Sword s twin sister and disappeared
There have been no news of her since then
Jade died in Hero s arms shortly after due to excessive blood loss during childbirth
Shadow continues narrating the story
After Jade s death Hero met a fortune teller who told him he was born under the Star of Death and is destined to lead a life of loneliness because misfortune will befall those who are close to him
Hero entrusted his baby son Sword to Sheng before leaving with Shadow to meet their master Pride
In Japan they witnessed a duel between Pride and his rival Invincible
Pride defeated Invincible but sustained internal injuries and died not long after the duel
Before his death Pride passed Hero the martial arts manual China Secret and transferred all his inner energy to him
Back in the present at China House the Boss Sword Sheng Luohan and others come up with a plan to liberate the labourers at Steel Bull Canyon
They disguise themselves as a Chinese opera troupe infiltrate the canyon and catch the supervisors off guard in a surprise attack
Luohan sacrifices himself in a suicide attack to stop the supervisors from throwing explosives at the escaping labourers
Sword corners Bigot and demands the whereabouts of his twin sister but Bigot suddenly pulls out a pistol and shoots him
Bigot is about to kill Sword when Hero shows up and finishes him off
Hero uses his inner energy to create an explosion and prevent a group of horsemen from advancing further
They return to China House in triumph
Sword is happy to see his father in person for the first time after hearing the stories about him
However Hero appears cold towards his son and constantly keeps a distance away because he strongly believes the fortune teller s words that he will lose his loved ones if he gets close to them
Hero also meets Wood who has maintained her crush on him for the past 16 years but he refuses to accept her
She warns Hero that her master Invincible has arrived in New York City
Since Pride is dead Invincible turns on Hero Pride s successor to finish the duel
The next morning Invincible shows up at China House and fights with the Boss and Sword until Hero appears and stops him
Hero and Invincible then duel on top of the Statue of Liberty
In the meantime Black Dragon Commander leads his men to attack China House but are eventually forced to leave by the police
At the Statue of Liberty Hero eventually defeats and destroys Invincible
Before the movie ends Sword and Sheng prepare to leave America while Hero watches them from a distance and walks away in the opposite direction

Its owner Mrs Lydia Brundage had reported it stolen in Cannes two months after insuring it in Paris with the Apex Insurance Company of New York for 325 000
Steve had tracked the thieves to Marseilles when he was murdered
He had left no reports of his investigations but McQueen an investigator in the Paris office of US Customs has checked his itinerary and has discovered that it coincided with the movements of one Matthew Royal
He also has reported that Royal has booked passage to the United States via KLM Royal Dutch Airlines on the 29th in two days time
Brandon has arranged for Cliff to fly to Paris so that he can return on the same plane as Royal and make his acquaintance

Joe resists and Owney beats him to death On board the plane Cliff s attempt to sit next to Royal is frustrated when Kathe exchanges seats with Royal so that she can sit with Cliff
As the plane approaches New York Kathe goes aft to the wash room
Another passenger alcoholic Doc Spencer exchanges a meaningful glance with Royal and follows Kathe
After a while he returns to his seat looks back towards the washroom then looks forward and nods to Royal
The stewardess goes into the washroom sees something which alarms her comes forward and fetches a crew member to the washroom then comes forward again and leads Cliff and Doc to the washroom
Kathe is lying on the floor unconscious
The stewardess and crew member leave Doc and Cliff alone with her
The Doc tells Cliff to ask the pilot to radio ahead for an ambulance
When Cliff leaves Doc gives Kathe an injection When the plane lands in New York Royal is intercepted by an official and led away
Kathe is stretchered into an ambulance where Owney and Birdie are waiting with the stolen immigration papers
Owney is impatient to get going but the ambulance man tells him that they must wait for clearance from immigration customs and health
Royal is thoroughly searched by Brandon and one of his agents but nothing untoward is found on him
A uniformed official approaches the ambulance
Owney shows the stolen papers and claims that he is Kathe s fiancé
The ambulance is cleared to leave and Owney and Birdie are allowed to accompany the unconscious Kathe Baffled by not finding the necklace on Royal Brandon suddenly thinks of the ambulance
His agent runs out flags down the ambulance and gets into the front seat with the driver
As the ambulance drives through the streets of New York Kathe starts to regain consciousness
Owney hits the attendant on the head with a gun knocking him out
He then holds the gun on the customs agent while Birdie undoes Kathe s head bandage in which the necklace is hidden
The ambulance crashes knocking out the driver and the customs agent

Still bemused Kathe alights from the ambulance necklace in hand
She takes a cab to her fiancé s address
Owney and Birdie hi jack a car and drive off On arriving at Joe s apartment Kathe finds Cliff already there
He accuses her of being in league with the crooks but her reaction to seeing Joe s body persuades him of her innocence
Through the window they see Owney and Birdie arriving
Kathe identifies them as her abductors
Cliff sends her to his place giving her a note for his landlady Minnie Hoffman
Taking the necklace with her she leaves by the fire escape and gets away in her waiting taxi
Owney breaks in and finds Cliff waiting for him peaceably
Owney disarms Cliff and takes him to Royal s place
Another thug Augie is there Royal offers Cliff half of the proceeds if he will hand over Kathe
When Cliff does not accept Owney and Augie beat him up
To check his identity they phone Cliff s office
Helen successfully maintains Cliff s cover
Royal releases Cliff and returns his gun
As Cliff is about to leave Royal receives a phone call
The caller Karney says Doc Spencer slipped out of his room
Royal tells him that the Doc has probably gone to Garcia s for some liquor
Cliff overhears this conversation and leaves felling Owney with a blow on his way out Cliff tours the wine bars casually enquiring if Karney has been in
At last he finds one where the storekeeper tells him that Karney went up to the hotel
Cliff buys a bottle of Benedictine and goes across the road to the Palace Hotel
He takes a room under the name of John Smith and learns that the desk clerk s name is Karney
Cliff goes upstairs and finds Doc drunk in one of the rooms
Cliff plies Doc with drink asking him if he was ever in Marseilles and if he ever heard of Matthew Royal
Drunk and befuddled Doc admits that Royal knifed Steve
The door opens and Owney and Karney enter
Owney has a gun
Karney leaves
Owney takes Cliff s gun from him and hits him on the head felling him
Owney and Cliff fight
Owney knocks Cliff out and then beats Doc to death for squealing Cliff comes to in a luxurious bed
He is watched over by a woman who introduces herself as Lydia Brundage and says he was brought to her apartment by Royal
She says that after her necklace was stolen in Paris Royal contacted her as an intermediary who could recover her necklace from the thieves for a quarter of a million dollars in cash
As she did not have such a sum in Paris they arranged that he would deliver the necklace in New York
She offers Cliff 100 000 dollars for it with no questions asked
Cliff tells her he is only interested in the affair for what he can get out of it himself
Lydia makes romantic advances to Cliff who plays along up to a point then leaves
When he has gone Royal appears from another room
He and Lydia embrace Cliff rings his office and Helen tells him that the woman with Owney in the ambulance was named Birdie Alton and that Owney hangs out at a joint in the Village called Rudi s Cliff goes home
Minnie and Kathe are there
Minnie has told Kathe who Cliff really is
Kathe shows Cliff that she has hidden the necklace in the freezer tray of the refrigerator Cliff takes Kathe to Rudi s
Owney is there
Cliff and Kathe pretend to him that they have been part of the conspiracy all along that Royal has now returned the necklace to Lydia and has been paid off and that they have received their share
Furious at the thought that he has been left out Owney leaves Cliff returns home with Kathe and finds that Minnie has been beaten up and the necklace is gone
He leaves and goes up to Lydia s penthouse using service stairs and outside access
Through a window he sees Owney holding Royal and Lydia at gunpoint
Royal is explaining that he has only just arrived with the necklace and is about to close the deal
He offers to pay Owney off with 5 000 but Owney takes all the money
Royal kills him with a knife

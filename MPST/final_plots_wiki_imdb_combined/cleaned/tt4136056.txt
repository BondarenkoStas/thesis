In the 1980s Brooklyn New York was suffering from a crack epidemic
Mike Dowd worked in the NYPD s 75th Precinct in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn which was considered to be one of the most dangerous precincts in the United States at the time
The 75th Precinct had one of the highest murder rates in the country during the late 1980s
Dowd describes being under appreciated for the amount of work he put in and hurting for money as the reasons for taking money from drug dealers
He initially began taking bribes from drug dealers on the streets before moving on to protecting a drug cartel leader and robbing from other drug dealers at gunpoint
Dowd and his then partner Henry Chicky Guevara recount the first time walking into a domestic dispute in an apartment and seeing bags of marijuana a duffle bag filled with approximately 20 000 in cash and two guns
Dowd communicated that he and his partner would take the duffle bag and guns
Dowd continued to rob drug dealers for thousands of dollars
Guevara resigned shortly after multiple police officers were arrested in the 77th Precinct for corruption related offenses
Ken Eurell a police officer at the 75th Precinct was then assigned as Dowd s new partner in June 1987
Eurell had a drinking problem and frequently drank on the job
Dowd and Eurell met a Dominican gang leader named Adam Diaz
Diaz ran The Diaz Organization a gang that was responsible for countless murders and drug trafficking throughout New York
He used several supermarkets in East New York as fronts to traffic drugs mainly cocaine
Dowd and Eurell began a working relationship with Diaz where they provided protection inside information about raids and moving kilos of cocaine
After numerous complaints and a prolonged investigation the Suffolk County Police Department arrested Dowd and Eurell on drug trafficking charges
Dowd and Eurell came out on bail
While out on bail Dowd concocted a plan with the Colombian gang to kidnap and rob a woman
His plan was to hand the woman over to the Colombians and for him and Eurell to take the money and flee the United States
Eurell agreed to Dowd s kidnapping scheme but instead went to Internal Affairs
Shortly after in July 1991 Dowd was arrested and sent to trial
He was the main focus of the 1992 Mollen Commission that investigated police corruption in the NYPD
In the wake of Dowd s arrest Mayor David Dinkins appointed the Mollen Commission to investigate police corruption within the NYPD
As a result dozens of officers across the city s precincts were arrested

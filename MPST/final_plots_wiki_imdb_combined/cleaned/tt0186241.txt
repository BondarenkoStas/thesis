Act I Twenty five years before the beginning of the opera the fairy Iolanthe committed the capital crime of marrying a mortal human
The Queen of the fairies commuted Iolanthe s sentence of death to banishment for life on the condition that Iolanthe left her husband and never communicated with him again
After the passage of 25 years the fairies still missing Iolanthe deeply plead with their Queen to pardon Iolanthe and to restore her place in fairyland
Summoned by the Fairy Queen Iolanthe rises from the frog infested stream that has been her home in exile
The Queen unable to bear punishing her any longer pardons Iolanthe who is warmly greeted by the other fairies
Iolanthe tells her sisters that she has a son Strephon noting that he s a fairy down to the waist but his legs are mortal
The fairies laugh that Iolanthe appears too young to have a grown son as one of the advantages of a fairy s immortality is that they never grow old
Strephon a handsome Arcadian shepherd arrives and meets his aunts
He tells Iolanthe of his love for the Lord Chancellor s ward of court the beautiful Phyllis who does not know of Strephon s mixed origin
Strephon is despondent however as the Lord Chancellor has forbidden them to marry partly because he feels that a shepherd is unsuitable for Phyllis but partly because the Lord Chancellor wishes to marry Phyllis himself
In fact so do half the members of Britain s House of Lords
The Fairy Queen promises her assistance
Soon Phyllis arrives and she and Strephon share a moment of tenderness as they plan their future and possible elopement
A cadre of the peers of the realm arrive in noisy splendour
They are all smitten with Phyllis and they have appealed to the Lord Chancellor to decide who will have her hand
The Lord Chancellor hesitates to act upon his own regard for Phyllis due to his position as her guardian
The Lords send for Phyllis to choose one of their number but she will not marry any of them as virtue is found only in a lowly cottage
The peers beg her not to scorn them simply because of their blue blood
Strephon approaches the Lord Chancellor pleading that Nature bids him marry Phyllis
But the Lord Chancellor wryly notes that Strephon has not presented sufficient evidence that Nature has interested herself in the matter
He refuses his consent to the marriage between Strephon and Phyllis
Disappointed Strephon calls on Iolanthe for help
She appears and promises to support her son
Spying on the two the peers led by the brainless and stuffy Earls Tolloller and Mountararat together with Phyllis see Iolanthe and Strephon in a warm embrace
All three jump to the obvious conclusion since the centuries old Iolanthe appears to be a girl of seventeen
The peers scoff at the seemingly absurd claim that Iolanthe is Strephon s mother as Strephon pleads She is has been my mother from my birth
Phyllis angrily rejects Strephon for his supposed infidelity and declares that she will marry either Lord Tolloller or Lord Mountararat
Strephon then calls for help from the fairies who appear but are mistaken by the peers for a girls school on an outing
Offended the Fairy Queen pronounces a magical sentence upon the peers Strephon shall not only become a Member of Parliament but will have the power to pass any bill he proposes
Act II Private Willis on night guard duty paces outside the Palace of Westminster and muses on political life
The fairies arrive and tease the peers about the success of MP Strephon who is advancing a bill to open the peerage to competitive examination
The peers ask the fairies to stop Strephon s mischief stating that the House of Peers is not susceptible of any improvement
Although the fairies say that they cannot stop Strephon they have become strongly attracted to the peers
The fairy Queen is dismayed by this
Pointing to Private Willis of the First Grenadier Guards who is still on duty the Queen claims that she is able to subdue her response to the effects of his manly beauty
Phyllis cannot decide whether she ought to marry Tolloller or Mountararat and so she leaves the choice up to them
Tolloller tells Mountararat that his family s tradition would require the two Earls to duel to the death if the latter were to claim Phyllis
The two decide that their friendship is more important than love and renounce their claims to her
The Lord Chancellor arrives dressed for bed and describes a nightmare caused by his unrequited love for Phyllis
The two peers try to cheer him up and urge him to make another effort to persuade himself to award Phyllis to himself
Strephon now leads both parties in Parliament but he is miserable at losing Phyllis
He sees Phyllis and reveals to her that his mother is a fairy which accounts for her apparent youth
Phyllis and Strephon ask Iolanthe to plead with the Lord Chancellor to allow their marriage for none can resist your fairy eloquence
This is impossible she replies for the Lord Chancellor is her husband
He believes Iolanthe to have died childless and she is bound not to undeceive him under penalty of death
However to save Strephon from losing his love Iolanthe resolves to present his case to the Lord Chancellor while veiled
Although the Lord Chancellor is moved by her appeal which evokes the memory of his wife he declares that he himself will marry Phyllis
Desperate Iolanthe unveils ignoring the warnings of the unseen Fairies revealing that she is his long lost wife and Strephon is his son
The Lord Chancellor is amazed to see her alive but Iolanthe has again broken fairy law and the Fairy Queen is now left with no choice but to punish Iolanthe with death
As she prepares to execute Iolanthe the Queen learns that the rest of the fairies have chosen husbands from among the peers thus also incurring death sentences but the Queen blanches at the prospect of slaughtering all of them
The Lord Chancellor suggests a solution change the law by inserting a single word every fairy shall die who doesn t marry a mortal
The Fairy Queen cheerfully agrees and to save her life the dutiful soldier Private Willis agrees to marry her
Seeing no reason to stay in the mortal realm if peers are to be recruited from persons of intelligence the peers join the fairy ranks and away they go to fairyland

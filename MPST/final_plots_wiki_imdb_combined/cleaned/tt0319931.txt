American Idol Top 3 Results Show May 17 2012Group Sing Got to Get You Into My Life The BeatlesFord Commercial It s just Jessica and Joshua engaging in silent movie hijinks Results Joshua Ledet
It s not results so much as it s recap and Jimmy s critique since we won t find out until the end who is gone Jimmy Sez That Joshua had a good night but perhaps not as good as the overly praise filled judges thought
He thought the Etta James song was good that Imagine wasn t the best choice and that the Mary J Blige song he picked for him didn t have enough melody for Joshua to sink into which was his fault
He thinks he should totally be in the finale Performance Lisa Marie daughter of Elvis Presley performs her song You Ain t Seen Nothing Yet Results Jessica Sanchez
Jimmy Sez He disagreed with Steven that the Mariah song could help her clinch a win thought the Aerosmith cover was good but not enough and unbelievably that he didn t know Jermaine sang part of I ll Be There so it was his fault she tripped up on that part
He deems her worthy for the finale There is a quick tribute to Donna Summer from Jimmy and for no apparent reason actress Rita Wilson aka Mrs Tom Hanks Performance Adam Lambert performs his song Never Close Our Eyes Results Phillip Phillips
Jimmy sez His first tune was good the Matchbox 20 song was a snoozefest and the Bob Seger cover was flawless and that won him the night Going Home Joshua Ledet
He sings himself out on James Brown s It s a Man s Man s Man s World
So your final two is Phillip and Jessica American Idol Top 3 Performance Show May 15 2012Theme Three songs Judges choice contestants choice Jimmy s choiceWe will get a look at their hometown visits throughout the show Contestant Joshua Ledet Randy says he picked an Etta James song because it s the type of song he s excelled at on the show in the past Song I d Rather Be Blind Performance It s a slow bluesy torch song that starts off with a nice restrained swagger and eventually builds into a more forceful shout growl showcase that draws the judges to their feet Judging Steven calls it so surreal to hear someone sing the old songs and deliver it just right he says he sounded like the American Idol tonight
JLo says he is such a throwback and he brought down the house
Randy says he hopes in the future he can take what he does and bring it to contemporary R B which is ailing and aching right now Contestant Jessica Sanchez JLo says they chose Mariah Carey s My All one of her favorite songs because it has a tenderness that she thinks Jessica will kill Song My All Performance She keeps it quiet and gentle to start
The higher notes are a little breathy and sound like they might be just a shade out of the range of her head voice
The low notes are rich and full though
It starts getting rough in spots pitch wise towards the end but she ends well Judging Randy says it was absolutely beautiful and that it s one of the best versions of Mariah songs ever performed on TV
JLo says it s a hard song to sing and she did it beautifully and her own way
Steven says she makes people hang on her every note
He says she may be the winner Contestant Phillip Phillips Steven says they picked Beggin by MadCon because it s got a melody that they want to see if he can hit it more strongly than usual Song Beggin Performance He starts with a big smile with just voice and guitar
He s singing in the high part of his register and it sounds good
The song picks up momentum and it s a lively acoustic rocker

As always it s an incredibly natural performance Judging Steven says it was beautiful and another thank you God moment
JLo says it was a pulled back and controlled performance and she knows that s hard but that he brings great depth to the lyrics which takes strength
Randy asks why he picked it
He says he heard it and it had a strong message

She does a very straightforward cover without a lot of flourish and it s nice to hear her hold it back a bit and she never goes to the annoying growl and that is indeed a good thing
Steven gives her a standing ovation Judging Steven says she took a great song and made it greater
JLo says she doesn t know how big a deal it is that Steven loved it and she thought it was good too

Randy thinks it s weird because he didn t like it either
He says it was too subdued and just okay Contestant Joshua The contestants get their songs via text from Jimmy
Joshua gets No More Drama
In the audience Jimmy says he picked the song because MJB combines a lot of the things that Joshua does Song No More Drama Mary J BligePerformance Again it s a pretty straightforward cover with Josh singing in measured tones on the verses and breaking out more during the choruses

JLo says it was a good choice from Jimmy

Shane Tori and Dustin are three students at the Wind Ninja Academy
Their less than stellar performance and tardiness gets them the occasional lecture from their Sensei Kanoi Watanabe
One day the academy is attacked by Lothor a banished ninja master who has returned to capture all ninja students
Shane Tori and Dustin are the only three remaining students and along with Sensei who has been transformed into a guinea pig by Lothor and his son Cam retreat into the underground Ninja Ops
There the three are given wind morphers which allow them to transform into Wind Power Rangers and protect the city of Blue Bay Harbor from Lothor s forces
When Lothor demonstrates his ability to make his monsters grow into giants the Rangers unleash the Ninja Zords which could combine into the Storm Megazord and destroy monsters with its arsenal of Power Spheres activated by special ninja power disks
Lothor again raises the stakes by sending his new allies to battle the Wind Rangers the Thunder Rangers Blake and Hunter who had their own Thunder Zords
The Thunder Rangers are on a mission to destroy the Wind Rangers Sensei who they believed to be responsible for their parent s death but a visit from the afterlife from Blake and Hunter s parents show them the truth that it was Lothor who killed them not Sensei
The Thunder Rangers see the error of their ways and join the Wind Rangers in the battle against Lothor bringing the Thunder and Ninja Zords together to form the Thunderstorm Megazord
When the Rangers lose their powers Cam uses the Scroll of Time to travel into the past and retrieve the Samurai Amulet a family heirloom in the possession of his late mother where he discovers how Lothor rose to power
Cam returns to the present and uses the amulet to become the Green Samurai Ranger armed with the Samurai Star Megazord which later combines with the Rangers zords to form the Hurricane Megazord
A lost scroll would later reveal to Cam the Lightning Riff Blaster which could summon the Mighty Mammoth Zord
In a last ditch effort to take over the world Lothor attempts to open the Abyss of Evil and release its evil into the world
In a final battle he steals the Samurai Amulet and uses it to take away all of the Rangers powers
However the wind rangers combine their inner ninja powers to overpower Lothor and throw him into the abyss
After the battle the powerless Rangers become ninja teachers at the Wind Ninja Academy

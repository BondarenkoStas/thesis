A group of US Army soldiers trained in underground warfare arrive at base camp in the jungle of Vietnam
The soldiers spend the first day and night getting to know each other
The next morning they begin to explore the Viet Cong s underground tunnel network at Cá»§ Chi
Led by Lieutenant Vic Hollowborn along with Platoon Sergeant Mike Heaney Corporal Dan Green and Privates Peter Harris Carl Johnson Terence Verano Jonathon Porterson Dean Garraty Samuel Graybridge Jim Lidford and Bob Miller
Armed with nothing more than bayonets pistols grenades and flashlights the US soldiers take to the tunnels in a search and destroy operation and begin to encounter dangers including primitive but lethal booby traps such as punji sticks grenades rigged with tripwire as well as roving Viet Cong
Meanwhile Garraty and Johnson are killed first and later Sergeant Heaney and Verano are both killed as Green escapes and up on the surface Harris and Lidford escape to the bottom of the tunnel and Lidford is killed later on Porterson successfully escapes through the tunnels
On the surface the Viet Cong also attack the US base
As things escalate above and below the ground soldiers for both sides are pushed to the limits of their humanity
Miller and Graybridge try to escape with the former barely making it but Graybridge is killed
The events implicate that all the protagonists are killed by each other by boobytraps or by the airstrike ordered by the wounded US commanding officer Hollowborn who called on it when everything seemed to have been lost
Green dies in the tunnels
Harris convinces Vo Mai that he isn t a threat to her or her family
Porterson retreats to the surface and later meets Miller at the camp where many soldiers have been slaughtered by the NVA
Porterson and Miller witness the bombings and their ultimate fate or survival is left ambiguous
Harris and Mai try to dig their way out slowly realizing they are both trapped with nowhere to go and had been left to die
They remain in the tunnels until the end of their days

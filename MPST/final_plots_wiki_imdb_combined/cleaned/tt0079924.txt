After walking off the stage before a performance Sunny is soon replaced in the band by a new girl
Sunny turns to Ralph for comfort and finds him cheating on her
Finally Sunny has a chance to sing solo on stage with the song Ralph wrote for her but she does not feel the love that she desires from the audience and gives up

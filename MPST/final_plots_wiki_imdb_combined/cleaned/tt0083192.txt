Gary needs a vacation from his rock star career
Sheila is the beautiful nurse he takes along
A super modern huge redwood concrete and glass home is the stage
A home that has a mind all to its own
It can see hear and make anything happen
You won t be able to move from your seat from fear that the supernatural effects could be real
Filmed entirely on location in Rancho Santa Fe California and at universal studios this 1981 NBC movie of the week is a must see
Very rare and difficult to find
Doesn t that make it even better

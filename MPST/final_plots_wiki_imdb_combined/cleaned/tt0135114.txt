As with every morning since he moved into Savile Row Willy Fog awakens at 8 00 am and rings for his servant only to remember that he fired him the previous day for his inability to follow Fog s precise schedule
He has already arranged an interview for a replacement former circus performer Rigodon who is even now rushing towards Fog s house to make his 11 00 am appointment
Rigodon is accompanied by his old circus colleague Tico who hides within his travelling bag and prompts him through the interview which gets off to a bad start when Rigodon arrives four minutes late
Nonetheless Rigodon is hired by Fog as his butler and soon departs for the Reform Club
At the club the main topic of conversation is the recent theft of 55 000 from the Bank of England which was discussed till the bank s governor Mr Sullivan arrives and requests a change of topic
Sullivan s off hand remark that the thief is still in London causes the elderly Lord Guinness to bring up an article in the Morning Chronicle detailing how it is now possible to travel around the world in eighty days
The article states that one departs London by train for Dover where one crosses to Calais and on to Paris
From there it is a train journey to Brindisi and the Suez Canal all within a week
Having rounded the Arabian peninsula one would arrive in Bombay on day 20 and then a three day railway journey to Calcutta
Hong Kong is reached on day 33 Yokohama on day 39 and then a mammoth three week crossing of the Pacific to arrive in San Francisco on day 61 a week long train crossing to New York City and then finally a nine day crossing of the Atlantic back to London making it possible to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days
The other members of the club laugh at Lord Guinness s suggestion that he would take on the challenge if he were younger prompting Fog to defend his honor by taking up the task himself
Sullivan bets Fog 5 000 that it is impossible and additional wagers by three other club members increase this amount to 20 000
He then stuns the club by announcing that he will leave that very evening and promises to return to the club by 8 45 pm on 21 December 1872
Rigodon is less than thrilled to hear the news of their impending trip having spent his life travelling with the circus
However he dutifully accompanies his master as they set out with Tico still in hiding
Little do they know however that they are pursued by three individuals determined to halt their progress
Inspector Dix and Constable Bully of Scotland Yard are convinced that Fog is the thief who robbed the Bank of England and the wicked and conniving Transfer a saboteur was hired by Mr Sullivan to impede Fog s journey in any way

The series centres on the day to day lives and loves of two shepherds turned musicians Jemaine Clemaine and Bret McClegnie who have uprooted themselves from their native New Zealand to try to make it big as a folk duo in New York City
The two have frequent appointments with their officious and ineffectual band manager Murray Hewitt a Deputy Cultural Attach√© at the New Zealand Consulate
Jemaine and Bret constantly fend off the amorous attentions of Mel a married woman who is their sole fan and stalker
Their friend Dave Mohumbhai works at a pawn shop and gives them advice on dealing with American women and culture
Other recurring characters include their landlord Eugene Bret s short term girlfriend Coco Jemaine and Bret s ex girlfriend Sally Mel s husband Doug and Murray s put upon assistant Greg
Most episodes centre on the five main cast members
The antagonists outside of this small group are usually either Doug their girlfriends or Australians
Jemaine or Bret break into song in each episode
The songs are built into the narrative structure of the show in several different ways
Some songs form part of the plot of the show
In these instances Bret or Jemaine sing to another character
Other songs serve as the internal monologue of one of the two
Typically at least once per show a song is shot in the form of a music video
Some songs use a combination of the styles
For example in the first episode Sally the song Most Beautiful Girl in the Room is a mix of Jemaine s thoughts and his spoken invitations to Sally to get a kebab and to go back to his place
The music video for Business Time depicts a daydream that Jemaine is having
As the series evolved other main characters also had their own musical interludes depicted in a similar manner to Jemaine and Bret s own songs
The enthusiastic manner in which the characters express themselves through song contrasts with the otherwise low key tone of the show
Thus when the characters cannot speak about their feelings the songs serve as inner monologues

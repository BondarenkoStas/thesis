Before the film begins Ponette s mother dies in a car crash which Ponette herself survives with only a broken arm
Following her mother s death Ponette s father leaves the young girl with her Aunt Claire and her cousins Matiaz and Delphine
Ponette and her cousins are later sent to boarding school
There the loss of her mother becomes even more harsh and painful when she is mocked on the playground for being motherless
Not yet having come to terms with her mother s death Ponette searches for her
Ponette becomes increasingly withdrawn and spends most of her time waiting for her mother to come back
When waiting alone fails Ponette enlists the help of her school friend Ada to help her become a child of God to hopefully convince God to return her mother
In the end Ponette visits a cemetery and cries for her mother who suddenly appears to comfort her and ask her to live her life and not be sad all the time
Her mother says she cannot keep coming back so Ponette must move on and go be happy with her father
Then it appears that her mother gives her a sweater that she did not bring to the cemetery and her father comments when he sees her that I haven t seen that sweater in a while

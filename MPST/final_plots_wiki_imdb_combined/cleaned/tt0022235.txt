Overview Set in Victorian London the play focuses on Macheath an amoral antiheroic criminal
Macheath marries Polly Peachum
This displeases her father who controls the beggars of London and he endeavours to have Macheath hanged
His attempts are hindered by the fact that the Chief of Police Tiger Brown is Macheath s old army comrade
Still Peachum exerts his influence and eventually gets Macheath arrested and sentenced to hang
Macheath escapes this fate via a deus ex machina moments before the execution when in an unrestrained parody of a happy ending a messenger from the Queen arrives to pardon Macheath and grant him the title of Baron
The details of the original 1928 text have often been substantially modified in later productions
A draft narration by Brecht for a concert performance begins You are about to hear an opera for beggars
Since this opera was intended to be as splendid as only beggars can imagine and yet cheap enough for beggars to be able to watch it is called the Threepenny Opera
Prologue A street singer entertains the crowd with the illustrated murder ballad or Bänkelsang titled Die Moritat von Mackie Messer
As the song concludes a well dressed man leaves the crowd and crosses the stage
This is Macheath alias Mack the Knife
Act 1 The story begins in the shop of Jonathan Jeremiah Peachum the boss of London s beggars who outfits and trains the beggars in return for a slice of their takings from begging
In the first scene the extent of Peachum s iniquity is immediately exposed
Filch a new beggar is obliged to bribe his way into the profession and agree to pay over to Peachum 50 percent of whatever he made the previous day he had been severely beaten up for begging within the area of jurisdiction of Peachum s protection racket
After finishing with the new man Peachum becomes aware that his grown daughter Polly did not return home the previous night
Peachum who sees his daughter as his own private property concludes that she has become involved with Macheath
This does not suit Peachum at all and he becomes determined to thwart this relationship and destroy Macheath
The scene shifts to an empty stable where Macheath himself is preparing to marry Polly once his gang has stolen and brought all the necessary food and furnishings
No vows are exchanged but Polly is satisfied and everyone sits down to a banquet
Since none of the gang members can provide fitting entertainment Polly gets up and sings Seeräuberjenny a revenge fantasy in which she is a scullery maid turning pirate queen to order the execution of her bosses and customers
The gang becomes nervous when the Chief of Police Tiger Brown arrives but it s all part of the act Brown had served with Mack in England s colonial wars and had intervened on numerous occasions to prevent the arrest of Macheath over the years
The old friends duet in the Kanonen Song
In the next scene Polly returns home and defiantly announces that she has married Macheath by singing the Barbarasong
She stands fast against her parents anger but she inadvertently reveals Brown s connections to Macheath which they subsequently use to their advantage
Act 2 Polly warns Macheath that her father will try to have him arrested
He is finally convinced that Peachum has enough influence to do it and makes arrangements to leave London explaining the details of his bandit business to Polly so she can manage it in his absence
Before he leaves town he stops at his favorite brothel where he sees his ex lover Jenny
They sing the Zuhälterballade about their days together but Macheath doesn t know Mrs Peachum has bribed Jenny to turn him in
Despite Brown s apologies there s nothing he can do and Macheath is dragged away to jail
After he sings the Ballade vom angenehmen Leben another girlfriend Lucy and Polly show up at the same time setting the stage for a nasty argument that builds to the Eifersuchtsduett
After Polly leaves Lucy engineers Macheath s escape
When Mr Peachum finds out he confronts Brown and threatens him telling him that he will unleash all of his beggars during Queen Victoria s coronation parade ruining the ceremony and costing Brown his job
Act 3 Jenny comes to the Peachums shop to demand her money for the betrayal of Macheath which Mrs Peachum refuses to pay
Jenny reveals that Macheath is at Suky Tawdry s house
When Brown arrives determined to arrest Peachum and the beggars he is horrified to learn that the beggars are already in position and only Mr Peachum can stop them
To placate Peachum Brown s only option is to arrest Macheath and have him executed
In the next scene Macheath is back in jail and desperately trying to raise a sufficient bribe to get out again even as the gallows are being assembled
Soon it becomes clear that neither Polly nor the gang members can or are willing to raise any money and Macheath prepares to die
He laments his fate and poses the Marxist questions What s picking a lock compared to buying shares
What s breaking into a bank compared to founding one
What s murdering a man compared to employing one

Macheath asks everyone for forgiveness
Then a sudden and intentionally comical reversal Peachum announces that in this opera mercy will prevail over justice and that a messenger on horseback will arrive Brown arrives as that messenger and announces that Macheath has been pardoned by the queen and granted a title a castle and a pension
The cast then sings the Finale which ends with a plea that wrongdoing not be punished too harshly as life is harsh enough

At the Arts for the Living Center in New York Candice Norman oversees the latest dance routine choreographed by Margie
Candice tells Margie that the act needs even more perfection in preparation for a visit from three talent agents
The academy director Dick Gibson meets with TV producers Bob Steiner and John Morris who watch a video of the dance and Candice learns that the men will only select three dancers for an upcoming TV show
That evening after the dance class is over one of the dancers Susan is murdered in the locker room by an unseen person who chloroforms then stabs her in the heart with a long hairpin needle
NYPD Lieutenant Borges arrives on the scene to investigate
Also with Lt Borges is the police profiler and psychotherapy professor Dr Davis
With Candice nowhere to be found suspicion begins to focus not only on her but on the victim s boyfriend Willy Stark as well as Dick Gibson
Candice arrives back at her apartment where she finds Dick waiting
He wants to talk about the potential relationships between the students and tries to convince Candice that there is nothing going on between him and any of the other students
While he is there the DJ from the studio Bob phones Candice and updates her on the murder at the academy
The next day the routine at the campus continues as normal causing Dick a great deal of upset since nobody seems to care about Susan s death
At a nearby coffee shop Lt Borges talks to Dick about a possible rivalry between the dancers
That evening at a local nightclub another student from the academy Janice dances alone for an audience and then walks home to her apartment
As with Candice the previous night she finds Dick waiting and wanting to talk
In her bedroom Janice finds a photograph of Dick and Susan but when she calls out to him he is gone
Janice finds her pet canary dead with a hairpin needle through its body
Panicked she runs to the front door where she is attacked and killed by the unseen assailant who thrusts a hairpin needle into her heart
Candice begins having nightmares of being attacked by a handsome young man wielding a long ornamental needle identical to the one used in the killings
Candice becomes more obsessed with the dream assailant when she sees an advertising billboard which features him prominently
Unable to shake the feeling that they are in some way predetermined to meet Candice tracks down the man in the poster to the seedy Fulton Hotel and bribes the desk clerk for the key to Mr Robinson s room
She explores the room but is shocked when the handsome model returns suddenly
The man introduces himself as George Webb who to Candice s repulsion is a drunken and disheveled wreck
With what seems like disappointment mingled with terror Candice flees from the room leaving her purse and ID behind
Meanwhile Lt Borges records a phone call to the police station from a person claiming be the killer
When a voice analyst identifies it as Bart one of the dancers Borges arrests him
Bart confesses to the phone calls as well as to killing Susan because she was crazy and Janice because she was Hispanic
Borges however states his belief that Bart is not the killer but a pathological liar
George goes to the academy to return Candice s purse where another dancer Gloria recognizes him from a modeling show they appeared in years earlier
Dick sees George and Candice on a security monitor and calls Borges saying that George must be the killer
Over lunch at a local Chinese restaurant the relationship between Candice and George becomes closer when she confides in him about an incident years earlier when a man on a motorcycle ran her over in a hit and run putting an end to her dancing career and forcing her to teach
Back at Candice s apartment she gets a phone call from Phil a local talent agent who has made a background check for her on George and informs her that he once had an affair with a young girl who later died
At the studio Candice is attacked by Margie using the killer s M O but she is subdued by Dick who turns Margie over to the police
A few days later Jill another dancer baby sits for the wheelchair bound Molly who takes pictures of her
When Jill answers a knock on the front door the killer forces his way into the apartment and stabs her with the hairpin
Molly frantically snaps away but does not get a clear view of the killer s face
The police arrest Dick when he s found running away claiming that he only arrived after the attack to find Jill dead
The following night the killer attacks and kills Gloria in the locker room in the same manner
At George s hotel room Candice lets herself in and finds a hairpin and bottle of chloroform in his drawer
Candice rushes out to her car and drives away
George arrives and seeing what Candice found tries to call her at her apartment but she is not home
At the police station Candice tells Borges of her discovery and that George is the killer and names the hotel where he is staying
Candice then goes over to the academy which has been closed down for the night and finds Gloria dead in the locker room
She calls Borges and tells him to meet her at the academy
Candice runs to the manager s room and finds George there
He turns on the music and a video showing all the dancers who have been killed
George walks in with the hairpin murder weapon and asks Candice why she planted this evidence in his hotel room thus connecting him to the murders
Candice then reveals that she has known from the very start that it was he George who was the hit and run motorcycle rider who ran her over ruining her career her future and her life
She tells him that she killed the young dancers out of jealousy of their talent their beauty and their rising careers all the while planning to frame him for the killings as her final act of revenge against him
She grabs George s pin holding hand and intentionally impales herself on it
Just as she falls to the floor breathing her last Lt Borges and Dr Davis arrive on the scene but before George can begin to explain they reveal that they already know he is not the killer
When they saw the photo slide Molly took of the killer s jacket they noticed that the buttons on the jacket were on the left side indicating that it belonged to and was being worn by a woman
In addition Candice told them details about the lion s head hairpin needle used in the killings information that since it had never been made public only the killer could know
George leaves with Lt Borges as the police seal off and investigate the scene

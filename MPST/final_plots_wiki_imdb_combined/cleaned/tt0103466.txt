The show follows the production of a fictional late night talk show The Larry Sanders Show
It chronicles the daily life of host Larry producer Arthur Artie sidekick Hank Kingsley and their interaction with celebrity guests the network and others
Episodes focus on the professional and personal lives of the principal characters with most focusing on Larry
Ancillary characters are also featured among them the writers Phil and Jerry talent bookers Paula and Mary Lou and the personal assistants Beverly Darlene and Brian
Larry s wife ex wife and girlfriends are frequent sources of conflict and his home is a secondary location for the show
A typical early episode opens to the titles with the sound of Hank s audience warm up routine in the background
This is followed by the talk show s titles and an excerpt from Larry s monologue
Episodes vary after this sometimes continuing with the studio recording but often cutting to a back stage shot or to the production offices
Writing and production The Larry Sanders Show is a satire on show business that mixes fact with fiction
It featured real life celebrity guests as they performed on the talk show and as they appeared behind the scenes
For example in the final episode Larry interviews Sean Penn who once they cut to a commercial break gossips freely about Shandling s acting insecurity and behaviour towards Penn s wife on the set of Hurlyburly in which all three appear
The scripts often shocked by appearing to show the guest s malice or the difference between their public and private personas
Profanities are used on the show although not gratuitously with the writers taking advantage of the freedom allowed by HBO as a subscription cable service
It paved the way for subsequent HBO shows such as Oz The Sopranos and Deadwood
According to Peter Tolan early episodes were also recorded with language suitable for broadcast syndication until midway through the second season when the actors resisted shooting the extra takes
The show used both videotape and film
The behind the scenes footage was shot on film often using hand held cameras in a documentary style
Four video cameras recorded the show within a show which gives a brighter less grainy picture and helps distinguish the talk show from the back stage scenes
The talk show was staged with realistic music lighting and set design
It was recorded in front of an actual live studio audience during the first season and then occasionally during later episodes
The show had a few catchphrases used throughout its entire run
The most common was Hey now a phrase Hank repeats in the opening credits of the fictional talk show and whenever he greets someone
It mirrors the Hi yo catchphrase used by Ed McMahon upon whom Hank Kingsley was based
In one episode Hank says he invented the phrase when he accidentally said it to someone and liked it
In 2007 Nickleodeon s TV Land ranked Hey Now as the 87th Best Television catchphrase
No flipping is a phrase Larry uses to go to commercial breaks encouraging the viewer audience not to change to another channel
In the series finale the last thing Larry says on his talk show is You may now flip

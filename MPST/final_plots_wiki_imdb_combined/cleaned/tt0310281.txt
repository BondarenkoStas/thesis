The film is structured as mockumentary about a memorial concert for folk music producer Irving Steinbloom
Upon his death his children organize a concert which they hope to feature his three most famous acts The Folksmen The New Main Street Singers and Mitch Mickey
The Folksmen trio Mark Shubb Alan Barrows and Jerry Palter were once the most popular of the acts but have not appeared together in decades
They had several minor hits and their most famous song was Old Joe s Place
Despite not playing or seeing each other for many years their reunion is a very positive affair as the Folksmen give each other big hugs and are happy to see one another
The New Main Street Singers are the second generation of the original Main Street Singers formed by George Menschell the only living member of the original group
Menschell sings and holds a guitar he cannot play
Performers include Terry Bohner and his wife Laurie Bohner
Laurie a former adult film star and her husband are founders of Witches in Nature s Colors a coven of modern day witches that worships the power of color
Another member is Sissy Knox a former juvenile delinquent and daughter of one of the original Main Street Singers
They are managed by Mike LaFontaine whose fifteen minutes of fame came by way of a failed 1970s sitcom Wha Happened
The show lasted for less than one season and has largely been forgotten but LaFontaine is constantly quoting the titular tagline to the puzzlement of others
The group which is otherwise entirely white includes one Filipino American member Mike Maryama and is known for their needlessly complex nine part harmonies
Mitch Cohen and Mickey Crabbe comprised Mitch Mickey a former couple that released seven albums until their dramatic break up years before the setting of the film
Mickey seemingly moved on and has married a medical supply salesman but Mitch had an emotional breakdown and has never fully recovered
Their most famous song was A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow at the end of which the pair would actually kiss on stage
The three groups which had sunk to various levels of musical irrelevance since their respective heyday agree to the reunion performance to be held at The Town Hall in New York and televised live on PBN
The film features rehearsals for the show along with interviews with the performers discussing their activities over the previous years and their feelings about performing again
The Folksmen are very enthusiastic and work hard to relearn their songs and hope to wow the audience
Mitch and Mickey are very apprehensive about how it will go
The show itself goes off with only two hitches The song that The Folksmen intend to open their set with is played first by the New Main Street Singers and Mitch temporarily disappears minutes before he and Mickey are to perform
It turns out that Mitch had gone to buy a rose for Mickey which she accepts with gratitude as they go on stage
Mitch and Mickey perform A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow and after a suspenseful pause they do the much anticipated kiss at the end
In the finale all three acts join together to sing A Mighty Wind
The film then jumps to interviews with many of the performers six months after the concert in which they detail subsequent events
Mickey is performing The Sure Flo Song at her husband s trade show booth
Mitch is writing poetry again claiming to be in a prolific phase
Mickey claims that Mitch overreacted to their onstage kiss while Mitch insists that Mickey s feelings for him returned
LaFontaine is trying to drum up interest for a sitcom starring the New Main Street Singers
He wants to call it Supreme Folk and have each play Supreme Court judges by day folk singers sharing a house by night
The Folksmen have reunited but with Mark Shubb now a transgender woman she continues to sing in her deep bass voice

The film is based on the true story of David Wilkerson a small town preacher who gets caught in the shadows of a crime ridden neighborhood in New York City
He encounters the Mau Maus a gang led by Nicky Cruz and David brings a message of hope to the angry youths
Guided by the street wise Little Bo David quickly learns about the neighborhood and how to approach the cynical juveniles
David came to New York City from a Pittsburgh suburb with little money and is put up in a small street chapel owned by a pastor with a loving family who supports David in his work and offers to help with food and shelter
Cruz at first dismisses Wilkerson as a joke then as a conspiracy to break up the Mau Maus serving to only intensify his desire to be rid of the preacher man
Nicky s girlfriend Rosa prostitutes in order to support her heroin addiction and later begs David to help her sober her drug habits
David realistically does not think Rosa can handle her heroin problem without medical attention but agrees to allow the pastor and his wife to have Rosa live with them and stand vigil as she goes through difficult withdrawals
After Rosa is sober she tries to convince Nicky that David comes to them out of love but Nicky becomes more and more frustrated
When David tries an attempt to reach out to all gang members in the area through a revival the pastor convince the NYPD not to survey the area in order to have the gangs think they are left alone
Nicky agrees with Big Cat the leader of the rival Bishops that they should rumble at the revival since no one would expect that
However during David s sermon his message that no one can be labeled and Christ s death on the Cross reaches Nicky and he stands up to Big Cat who is ready to attack David
The film concludes by saying that in the question of the Cross and the Switchblade the Cross proved stronger
Nicky Cruz would go on to become an ordained minister preaching the gospel due to the initial efforts of David Wilkerson
In the end they start a center called Teen Challenge to support teens

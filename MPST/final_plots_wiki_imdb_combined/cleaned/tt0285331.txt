Sethuraman escapes with Mani and boards a train
Before Athreya arrives he hands Mani to a passenger named Sathyabama and pleads her to save his son
Athreya kills Sethuraman and is seriously injured in an attempt to escape
Sathyabama s father is against her decision to save Mani and she leaves with him for Chennai to honour the promise given to Sethuraman
26 years later Mani becomes a watchmaker who considers Sathyabama as his biological mother
A paralysed Athreya wakes up from coma and decides to find the watch he hopes to go back to 1990 and save himself from the accident
In a series of incidents Mani finds Sethuraman s watch and explores its powers
Using them he manages to impress Sathya his client who hails from Sathyabama s native place Gopalasamudram
Athreya s close aide Mithran issues an advertisement offering five crores to the one who finds Sethuraman s watch
Including Mani many prepare the duplicate of the watch and submit them

Mithran places the watch on Mani s right hand and leaves

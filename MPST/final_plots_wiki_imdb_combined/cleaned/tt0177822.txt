Setting Grim Fandango takes place in the Land of the Dead where recently departed souls aim to make their way to the Land of Eternal Rest
Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul the best of which is the Number Nine a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld
Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot which would take around four years
Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the Land of the Dead
The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land of the Dead and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited
Each year on the Day of the Dead these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living
The souls in the Land of the Dead appear as skeletal calaca figures
Alongside them are demons that have been summoned to help with the more mundane tasks of day to day life such as vehicle maintenance
The souls themselves can suffer death within death by being sprouted the result of being shot with sproutella filled darts that cause flowers to grow out through the bones

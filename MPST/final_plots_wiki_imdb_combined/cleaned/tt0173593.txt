Set in the year 1998 the world is on the brink of a cataclysmic war
An organization dedicated to taking over the world through the brutal use of air power is about to realize its goal
It is known as the Skull Squadron founded by a band of renegades whose planes are capable of time travel
These pilots fall in love with the power they hold and see that they can use their planes to take control of the world
There are always pilots who twisted by war s cruelties are willing to join the Skull Squadron causing it to grow bigger and more dangerous
In the 1990s Skull Squadron is finally powerful enough to scramble for the master mission in its bid for world domination
By now almost too late the great nations of the world are aware of Skull Squadron s plot
They band together to produce an aircraft that gives them a fighting chance against the onslaught the Justice class air carrier which can travel through time
The carrier is outfitted with a small crew then sent back in time
The Justice crew beams the best planes and pilots right out of history s greatest air battles to train them to fight against the Skull Squadron
A handful of pilots are selected as Ring Commanders to train and supervise the hundreds who remain
Ring Commanders are identified by their special signal ring through which they can summon a fellow Ring Raider in times of need
Ring of Fire Scorch s Revenge All the Right Stuff The Best Man for the Job is a Woman and A Pilot s Faith were all pilot episodes but the series was never taken up as a full season show
The animation art design was done by Peter Chung based on the Those Characters From Cleveland art and toy designs of Mark Spangler and Jim Groman
The show used the catchphrase The command is in my hand when characters wished to transform their planes using their rings to make them more powerful
Their improved forms could only be held for a short time or the pilot risked burning out their nervous system

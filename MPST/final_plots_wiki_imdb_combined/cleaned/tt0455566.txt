One of the most obvious changes to the plot of the video game is the absence of the villainous organisation SPECTRE who played a vital role in the film
Due to legal issues that have plagued the James Bond film series since 1963 the organisation was renamed OCTOPUS and appears to lack a central leader in the same vein as Ernst Stavro Blofeld
The SPECTRE name was tied up in a long running dispute over the film rights to Thunderball between United Artists MGM and the now deceased writer Kevin McClory
The game begins with a standard pre title sequence in which Elizabeth Stark the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom s daughter is kidnapped by OCTOPUS while attending a party
Fortunately Bond was assigned to attend the party for just such an event and he defeats OCTOPUS and rescues Miss Stark
Similar to the film OCTOPUS has conceived a plan to embarrass British secret service agent 007 for the death of Dr Julius No from the film Dr No in which No was an agent of SPECTRE
The plan involves the theft of a Soviet encoding machine known as the Lektor with the help of a defecting Soviet agent Tatiana Romanova
However Romanova is being used by OCTOPUS to lure James Bond into a trap their ultimate goal is to let him obtain the Lektor and then ambush him for it killing him in humiliating fashion as well
Romanova is sent by Rosa Klebb an agent of the KGB who has secretly defected to OCTOPUS
Her immediate subordinate Donald Red Grant protects Bond through the first half of the game and attacks him in the second
The game ends with a final assault on OCTOPUS headquarters during which Grant is fatally shot by Bond

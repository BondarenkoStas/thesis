This film is the first in a sequence of four
The first two films out of the four in the series concern Patty and her two female friends
The chief conflict is whether or not Patty will take the Mark of the Beast or not in the face of the threat of execution by the forces of the Beast
Patty Jo Myers is a young woman who considers herself a Christian because she occasionally reads her Bible and goes to church regularly where the pastor is really an unbeliever
She refuses to believe the warnings of her friends and family that she will go through the Great Tribulation if she does not accept Jesus
One morning she awakens to find that her family and millions of others have suddenly disappeared
Gradually Patty realizes that the Rapture an event some interpret from the Bible has happened and she and everyone else left behind are entering into the Great Tribulation the last days of Earth dominated by the Antichrist
A government system called UNITE is set up and those who do not receive the mark identifying them with UNITE will be arrested
Patty desperately tries to avoid the law and the mark but is captured by UNITE
Patty escapes but is cornered by UNITE on a bridge and falls from the bridge to her death
Patty then awakens this time for real and realizes that all she had experienced was only a dream
Her relief is short lived when the radio announces that millions of people have disappeared
Horrified Patty frantically searches for her family only to find them missing too
Traumatized and distraught Patty realizes that the Rapture has indeed occurred and she s been left behind
In the ensuing plot the questions are 1 will she be caught and 2 will she take the mark to escape execution
The plot is somewhat hard to understand in the second film because the story of Patty is told in flashbacks within flashbacks
But it ends dramatically with Patty witnessing her friend Wenda being executed and arguing with Wenda s younger sister Sandy who betrayed them and being prepped for her own execution
The 3rd and 4th films are spliced on to the ending of the second film but begin a rather new story that of Dave Leslie and Connie
Leslie is with Patty at the guillotine when she escapes due to the eschatological earthquake
She runs goes down into an underground room and meets Dave there
It is love at first sight
Dave and Leslie have a romance
While the plot is a bit difficult to understand Dave s purpose seems to be 1 to develop a fake mark so that a person can buy and sell without using the actual Beast s mark and 2 to destroy the master computer of the Beast by injecting into it a destructive code which in fact is the song Onward Christian Soldiers
The story is presented with action scenes and interspersed long conversations
Connie is an agent of the Beast who pretends to cooperate with Dave

There is a third son in the house however born from the black cook Marpessa who acts as butler this is Whity

His only hope of any decency lies in his friendship with the town s saloon singer and whore Hanna
She has landed a job back in the east and offers to take Whity with her but he says he must stay with his family
To trap Katherine Ben arranges for a Mexican called Garcia to pretend he is a physician and to seduce her confiding to her that Ben has not long to live

When he learns that Hanna witnessed the murder he pays her for her silence

Inspector Glebsky arrives at the hotel Dead Mountaineer s because of an anonymous call
This hotel is located in a remote area in a valley hidden among the mountains in some European country
The very name of the hotel Dead Mountaineer s can be explained quite simply one climber died here who fell off a cliff
He left only his faithful dog behind a St Bernard Lel
In the hotel there is a rather bleak portrait of the climber near which faithful Lel likes to sleep
Almost all of the lodgers are rather strange especially Mr and Mrs Moses and Olaf Andvarafors
Later another strange individual materializes Luarvik who can not even utter a couple of words
Mr Moses and Luarvik turn out to be aliens and Mrs Moses and Olaf are their robots although they look like ordinary people
And in the mountains they suffer a calamity
After a heavy snowfall when the hotel is cut off from the outside world a body appears at one point
Inspector Glebsky initiates an investigation using all of his standard skills
However the investigation of the pseudo murder of Olaf comes to a standstill
And when seemingly all intricacies of the plot unravel and the aliens can safely leave the Earth a military helicopter appears
The inspector has a chance to do great service to the aliens but Glebsky behaves like a typical cop subordinate only to common sense and official instructions which leads to the tragic outcome
At the end of the film the inspector is plagued by doubts whether he did everything he could

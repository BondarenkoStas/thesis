A depressed Tom sits on the railroad tracks bent on suicide
Watching from a bridge above the tracks overhead Jerry laments his old friend s state
Jerry knows that when he gets home his own friends will ask him why he didn t even try to stop Tom
Jerry believes that it s better this way and for the first time since he met her he will be happy
Jerry recalls the events leading up to Tom s depression Tom and Jerry are inseparable friends until a beautiful white female cat catches Tom s eye
The white cat initially reciprocates Tom s affections but that soon changes for the worst the much wealthier Mr Butch lives next door to the white cat and he also becomes smitten by her
He rudely interrupts her relationship with Tom to make his move and ignores Tom s attempts to stop him
Attracted by Butch s wealth the white cat proves herself to be an opportunist as Jerry always suspected her to be and leaves Tom
Having seen the white cat for who she is and how she has made a fool of his best friend Jerry urges Tom to give up and let Butch have her
Ignoring Jerry s warnings Tom pushes himself and his finances to the limit and beyond in futile attempts at winning back the white cat s affections
He brings her such presents as flowers perfume a diamond ring and a car
However because Butch s presents are much bigger to the point of outrageous extravagance the white cat rejects the desperate Tom
After this incident Tom gives up all hopes of gaining the white cat and falls into a depression
Broken hearted penniless and hopelessly in debt Tom drowns his sorrows in milk despite Jerry s pleas for him to stop
Tom almost lets himself go down the gutter but Jerry rescues him
As Jerry resuscitates Tom they both see the white cat riding by in Butch s coupe laden with luggage and a Just Married sign on the back
Jerry breaks from the sad story to think about his own girlfriend Toots
He is happy that unlike Tom s ex girlfriend she has been faithful
Suddenly Jerry s love world is shattered when Toots rides by with another mouse a Just Married sign on the back of their car
Jerry now dejected joins Tom on the railroad tracks
They sit and wait for an oncoming train which draws near to run over them
The oncoming train s whistle sounds louder as the cartoon fades out

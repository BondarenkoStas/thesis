While Morrowind contains many quests and storylines the central plot revolves around The Tribunal a triumvirate of god like beings ruling over Morrowind and their struggle against a former ally the deity Dagoth Ur and his Sixth House a cult of followers stretching out from Red Mountain the volcanic center of Vvardenfell the island on which the game is set
Dagoth Ur has used the Heart of Lorkhan an artifact of great power to make himself immortal and now seeks to drive the Imperial Legion occupiers from Morrowind using his network of spies as well as Akulakhan an enormous mechanical golem powered by the Heart of Lorkhan
After a storm and a strange dream vision the player begins fresh off a boat from a mainland prison in a town called Seyda Neen freed by the string pulling of the current ruler of the Tamrielic Empire Emperor Uriel Septim VII with the task of meeting Caius Cosades a member of the Blades a secret group of spies and agents working for the Emperor and the Empire
Cosades inducts the player into the Blades on the Emperor s orders and sets the player on various quests to uncover the mysterious disappearances and revelations that the citizens of Vvardenfell have experienced particularly the Sixth House and the Ashlander prophecies of the Nerevarine
It is later revealed that the induction under Cosades and the player s release from prison was due to the Emperor s suspicion that the player might be The Nerevarine a reincarnation of the legendary Dunmer hero Indoril Nerevar
The player is tasked with uncovering the prophecies regarding the Nerevarine and to fulfil them in order to finally defeat Dagoth Ur and his Sixth House cult
Prophecies from the nomadic people living in the Ashlands The Ashlanders predict that Nerevar s incarnate will fulfill a set of seven prophecies
The first two prophecies are that the Nerevarine will be born on a certain day to uncertain parents and will be immune to Corprus disease a Divine disease created by Dagoth Ur
The player has already fulfilled the first hence he she was chosen for the task the player becomes immune to Corprus by contracting the disease and surviving an experimental cure
Fulfilling these the player seeks to complete the third prophecy a test to find the Moon and Star the symbolic ring originally worn by Nerevar which has the power to instantly kill anyone apart from himself who tries to wear it
Upon finding and equipping the ring the player receives a vision from Azura the ancient Daedric Prince of the Dawn and Dusk who confirms that the player is Nerevar s incarnate
The Nerevarine completes the fourth and fifth trials which are to rally the Great Houses of the Dunmer and Ashlanders of Vvardenfell under one banner
After receiving the support and being declared Hortator by every Great House and Nerevarine by all nomadic Ashlander tribes the player is officially albeit reluctantly called Nerevarine by the Tribunal Temple who normally persecute anyone who claims to be the Nerevarine and sentences them to death
The Nerevarine is invited to the palace of the poet god king Vivec one of the three deities that forms the basis of Morrowind s religion known as the Tribunal to discuss the assault on Dagoth Ur s stronghold in the heart of Red Mountain
Vivec presents the player with the gauntlet Wraithguard an ancient Dwemer artifact that allows the use of the tools of Sunder and Keening
These ancient implements were created by the dwemer to tap into the power of the fabled Heart of Lorkhan which they found beneath Red Mountain and these same tools have been used by the Tribunal and Dagoth Ur to reach their god like status
The tools can however also destroy the fabled Heart of Lorkhan but without having the Wraithguard equipped they will deal a fatal blow to whoever wields them
The player travels into Red Mountain to Dagoth Ur s citadel
After talking with Dagoth Ur who attempts to sway the player to his side with the claim that he is merely following Nerevar s final orders the player and Dagoth Ur fight
Besting Dagoth Ur the Nerevarine soon discovers that while the Heart of Lorkhan is still intact Dagoth Ur remains immortal and he soon returns from death
Making his way to the very heart of the mountain the Nerevarine finds the Heart of Lorkhan and destroys it severing Dagoth Ur from his power and ultimately killing him
Akulakhan s Chamber where Lorkhan s heart resided is destroyed in the process as the cavern collapses and in turn Red Mountain is cleared of blight and The Sixth House falls
Upon escaping from the chamber the Nerevarine is congratulated by Azura who comes to reward the player s efforts of fulfilling the prophecy
The game does not end upon the main quest s completion but the game world Vvardenfell is affected in many different ways
The Blight Storms cease to plague the land and the weak minded followers of the Sixth House are re awakened remembering nothing of their ordeal
The Dreamers who harassed the Nerevarine fall silent and the Nerevarine becomes widely known as the savior of Vvardenfell
The quintessential consequence of defeating Dagoth Ur was the destruction of the Heart of Lorkhan
Due to their immortality linked to the heart Vivec and the Tribunal become mortal again leaving Vivec s future in question and up to the player to determine his fate
The loss of divinity among the Tribunal is the main plot point of the game s first expansion Tribunal

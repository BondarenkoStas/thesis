The film takes place at the Millennium building in New York City which has 102 floors and 73 elevators
One evening lightning strikes the building which causes the three main express elevators to begin acting strangely resulting in a guard s flashlight being crushed
The next day a group of pregnant women are held up between floors 20 and 21
The elevator overheats rapidly causing two women to give birth and hospitalizing the rest
Reporter Jennifer Evans is called to write a report on the incident
After an investigation by METEOR elevator company technicians Jeff and Mark Newman they determine that nothing is wrong with the elevators a large part being Jeff s inability to actually admit there is something wrong
A short time later a blind man and his guide dog disappear in the building
The two guards from the beginning of the film discover the dog s corpse hanging from its collar on a shaft support
The discovering guard s head is caught between the elevator doors
He is decapitated a short while later his partner too horrified to help him
Once again the METEOR executives find nothing wrong with the elevators
Evans interviews Newman who sarcastically states Nine people out of ten make it out of an elevator alive
Evans places this in her report causing a large controversy over his statement by his boss Mitchell and the police
During the same day a roller skater is sucked into an elevator in the parking garage and shot from the 86th floor of the building to his death
The roller skater s death is explained to media as suicide
Evans visits Newman and shows him a tape of the roller skater s death
She points out the time it normally takes for the elevator to go up 87 floors would take about 40 seconds to a minute
However the elevator ascended the floors in less than two seconds thus noting that there is definitely something wrong
When they try to show the tape to Jeff he refuses to watch it and leaves abruptly
Instead they go to Evans office and look up a man named Gunther Steinberg who had been experimenting with organic reproducing computer chips using dolphin brains
However the project had gone disastrously wrong and Steinberg was fired
Later the next morning Milligan who remains suspicious of the elevators throughout the film discovers Jeff s corpse in an elevator shaft
When Jennifer and Mark arrive they are shocked to hear that the police have concocted a story that has Jeff being a terrorist and being behind the incidents and assure the public that the threat is over
Later during the day an elevator cab flies to top floor at such a speed that the floor flies off and all the people in it are killed
This event reaches the President and is seen as an act of terrorism
A terrorism unit is assembled at the building to get any further terrorists out of the building
Meanwhile Jennifer and Mark discover a recent suicide could be linked to the incidents as his extremely superstitious widow believes his soul has returned to punish others
Jennifer and Mark enter the building to discover and stop the threat once and for all
During the entry Jennifer is taken into custody posing as a METEOR executive
During her first attempt to prove this fraud she receives a phone call from a friend to explains that while Steinberg s time working on the fucking chips as they are called in the movie has been revoked Steinberg continued to work on the project except not with dolphin brains
Eventually Mitchell abandons Steinberg for fear of his own reputation being ruined
Mark manages to get into the Millennium Building and discovers a large bio chip in the form of a brain in an elevator shaft
It is assumed that this brain is alive and controlling the elevators
He attempts to destroy using a screwdriver but this attempt fails when it sends a flaming elevator down to kill him
Mark barely escapes while the elevator kills a SWAT officer who was barely out of the elevator shaft before he was sliced in half from his waist down with the upper half of his body sliding across the floor
Marshall gets a hold of a stinger missile launcher and is about to destroy the organ when Steinberg intervenes threatening him
Jennifer appears having escaped custody and frees Marshall
As Mark tries to destroy the organ a third time the police enter giving Steinberg the opportunity to hold Jennifer hostage
Jennifer manages to escape thanks to Steinberg being unable to recognize one of his superiors
Steinberg is grabbed by the elevator shaft cables and pulled in along with Mark
At the last second Jennifer kicks the stinger launcher to Mark who proceeds to destroy the organ
Steinberg s mutilated corpse falls seconds later
Some time later Mark and Jennifer leave a hospital where they find themselves trapped in an elevator
However it proves to be a ruse for Mark to make a romantic overture toward Jennifer
The film then cuts out to Aerosmith s song Love in an Elevator

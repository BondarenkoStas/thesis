Angel s Egg follows the life of an unnamed young girl living alone in an undefined building near an abandoned city
She cares for a large egg which she hides under her dress protecting it while scavenging the decrepit Neo Gothic Art Nouveau cityscape for food water and bottles
In a prologue an unnamed soldier looking boy watches as an orb shaped vessel covered with thousands of goddess like sculptures descends from the sky
Awakened by the orb s whistles the girl begins her day of scavenging but soon crosses paths with the boy on a wide street traveled only by obscure roving tanks
Frightened by the boy who carries a threatening cross shaped device over his shoulder the girl runs off down an alley
When she returns to investigate the boy has left
She resumes searching for food and glass bottles avoiding the ominous figures of men clutching harpoons which scatter the cobbled streets
After a moment of respite to eat her findings the girl spots the boy and approaches him
He turns and surprisingly produces her egg from underneath his cape she had abandoned it on the plaza where she was eating
He instructs the girl to Keep precious things inside you or you will lose them and returns the egg
When asked what she believes is inside the egg the girl asserts that she can t tell him
The boy then suggests breaking the egg to find out which incenses the girl and drives her storming away only to be diligently pursued by the boy
Eventually the chase gives way to the pair bonding as the stoic fishermen figures spring to life and frighten the girl
The fishermen race after enormous shadows of coelacanth like fish that swim across the surfaces of streets and buildings lobbing their harpoons at the brick and stone
As the shadows swim away the girl explains that while the fish are gone the men persist in hunting
The pair wait out the commotion within a vast church like Opera decorated with stained windows of fish
Leaving the city and heading towards the girl s settlement the pair stop within a massive structure which appears to be the carcass of a beached leviathan
Noticing an engraving of a tree on a pillar the boy describes his memory of a similar tree which grew to hold a giant egg containing a sleeping bird an image shown at the start of the film
When the girl inquires as to what the bird dreams of the boy flatly asks if the girl still won t tell him what s inside her egg
The pair ascend a staircase arrayed with bottles of water like those the girl collects on each step
Adding her newest tribute to the line of bottles the girl and boy reflect on their amnesia caused by their long lives as to their identity and purpose
The boy begins to recount the biblical tale of Noah s Ark describing the flood its survivors and their search for land by awaiting the return of a dove
The tale deviates down a fatalistic turn when the boy claims that the dove never returned to the ark and thus its passengers forgot why they were sailing forgot about the civilization drowned below forgot about the animals that turned into stone and lost all connection with who they were alike the girl and the boy
The boy pensively asks the girl if they themselves or any of the strange world they live in really exists or if it is merely a memory like his image of the sleeping bird
The girl suddenly insists that the bird does exist and leads the boy down corridors of ancient fossils to arrive at a chapel like alcove
The boy looks on aghast against the far wall is the fossilized skeleton of an angel
The girl explains her intent to hatch the egg and return it to the bird she d found
The boy solemnly explains this was what he had suspected all along
Later the pair warm themselves within the girl s settlement
As the girl drifts off to sleep she speaks to the creature inside her egg of their future together
Outside the heavy rain consumes the city and floods the streets
While the girl is turned away from the egg in her sleep the boy takes it and raises his cross shaped device high to smash it
After smashing the egg the boy leaves
Awaking the next day the girl discovers the broken shell of her egg and shrieks out utterly heartbroken
She starts to run away from her settlement into the woods past a giant tree holding a huge egg suddenly throwing herself into a deep ravine
She kisses her reflection on the water before diving into it
Beneath the water the girl transforms into an adult woman before releasing a final breath which rises to the surface as a multitude of bobbing eggs
As the rain suddenly abates trees holding eggs like those described by the boy are shown to be scattered throughout the landscape
The boy stands on a vast shore littered with white feathers as the orb like vessel rises from underneath the ocean
Among the thousands of statues adorning the orb is a new feature a figure of the girl sitting serenely on a throne and caressing the egg in her lap
The screen slowly pans out to reveal that the land of the beach the forest and the city is part of a small and lonely island within a vast sea appearing not unlike the hull of an overturned ship

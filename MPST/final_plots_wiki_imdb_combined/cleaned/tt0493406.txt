AMERICA THE LAND OF THE FREE THE HOME OF THE BRAVE A MECCA FOR IMMIGRANTS WHERE THE AMERICAN DREAM IS AN INALIENABLE TRADITION
A YOUNG MAN IS ACCUSED OF MURDER
HES ON THE RUN AN UNDERDOG AND A MAN AGAINST THE ODDS
HE BECOMES A FUGITIVE AND IS VICIOUSLY HUNTED DOWN IN A TIME WHEN STEALING A HORSE GOT YOU HUNG BUT KILLING A CHINAMAN WAS NO CRIME
CAN THIS YOUNG CHINESE IMMIGRANT FIND JUSTICE
SURVIVE WHILE STRUGGLING FROM WITHIN AND CONFRONTING GREED RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL DIVIDES
PERSEVERING BIGOTRY CHEAP LABORAT WHAT PRICE
THIS UNTOLD TALE OF AMERICAS PAST WILL TRANSPORT YOU ON A PROVOCATIVE EAST MEETS WEST JOURNEY
INTERTWINED WITH THE ROOTS OF THE CHINESE THE AFRICAN AMERICANS AND THE MEXICANS DRAMATICALLY CLASH WITH AN EMERGING NEW AMERICA
CAN NON VIOLENCE PEACE LOVE REDEMPTION AND FORGIVENESS TRANSFORM THIS VIOLENT LAWLESS WILD WEST INTO A MORE PEACEFUL MORAL AND ENLIGHTENED AMERICA

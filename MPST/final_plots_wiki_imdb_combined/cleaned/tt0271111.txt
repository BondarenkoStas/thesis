Perfect Dark is set in 2023 against the backdrop of an interstellar war between two races the Maians who resemble the archetypal grey alien and the Skedar reptile like extraterrestrials who use a holographic disguise to appear as Scandinavian humans bearing similarities to Nordic aliens
Using this disguise they can interact with humans on Earth without looking too overtly suspicious
Meanwhile on Earth there is an ongoing rivalry between two factions The Carrington Institute a research and development center founded by Daniel Carrington that secretly operates an espionage group in league with the Maians and dataDyne a defence contractor corporation headed by Cassandra De Vries that secretly maintains a deal with the Skedar in exchange for creating an AI capable of cracking an ancient alien spacecraft buried on the ocean floor the Skedar have agreed to supply them with enough alien technology to become the biggest corporation on Earth
The player is cast as Carrington Institute agent Joanna Dark whose excellent scores in training have earned her the codename Perfect Dark
On her first mission she is sent to extract a scientist named Dr Caroll from the dataDyne skyscraper
When Joanna rescues Dr Caroll she learns that he is an AI who decided to defect from dataDyne after realising that the company betrayed ethical and moral standards
After the operation Carrington is held captive at his private villa by dataDyne soldiers and forced to tell them where Dr Caroll has been hidden
Joanna manages to rescue Carrington who informs her that Dr Caroll has been taken to the G5 Corporation headquarters in Chicago because he is suspected to be a front for dataDyne
In Chicago Joanna learns that dataDyne and their conspirators plan to kidnap the President of the United States to get access to a deep sea research vessel called Pelagic II
Despite the President being in danger Carrington alerts Joanna that a Maian craft was shot down near Area 51 and sends her to rescue any survivors from the base
While inside the base she rescues one survivor a Maian protector named Elvis who is key in stopping the conspiracy
As the President of the United States refuses to loan dataDyne the Pelagic II the conspirators plot to kill him and replace him with a dataDyne grown clone
To accomplish their plans an NSA strike team led by Trent Easton invades the air base from which Air Force One will depart
When Joanna foils this strike the NSA along with some Scandinavians take over the plane itself which crashes after an attempt to detach a craft attached to it
Having survived the crash Joanna eliminates the President s clone and rescues the real President
Meanwhile Easton is killed by one particular Scandinavian known as Mr Blonde who is revealed to be a Skedar in disguise
Without permission from the President dataDyne decides to hijack the Pelagic II and reach the ancient spacecraft
However unbeknownst to dataDyne the Carrington Institute learns that the spacecraft contains a powerful weapon capable of destroying a planet and that the conspirators are actually Skedar aliens disguised as Scandinavian humans who intend to test the weapon on Earth before using it against the Maian homeworld
Joanna and Elvis follow the conspirators to the ancient spacecraft and eventually find a reprogrammed Dr Caroll cracking the weapon
Joanna replaces its current personality with a backup of the original and the restored Dr Carroll sets the weapon to self destruct
In retaliation for ruining their plans the Skedar launch a strike on the Carrington Institute capturing Joanna and taking her to their homeworld
While in their spaceship she is met by De Vries who has also been imprisoned due to her failure to comply with the deal
Feeling that she has been used De Vries redeems herself by making a distraction and sacrificing herself freeing Joanna and therefore giving herself a chance for revenge
Joanna is later assisted by Elvis and the pair manage to land on the Skedar planet
There she defeats the Skedar High Priest leaving the Skedar in disarray
The game ends with Elvis and Joanna leaving the planet just prior to an orbital bombardment from the Maian navy

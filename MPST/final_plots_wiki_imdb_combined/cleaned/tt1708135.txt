In November 1939 after planting a bomb inside a column of a Munich bierkeller Georg Elser attempts to cross into neutral Switzerland but is caught at the border
His home made bomb detonates but misses killing Adolf Hitler the German leader by just 13 minutes
The German security services find incriminating evidence on Elser and link him to the assassination attempt
They believe Elser must have been working with a group of conspirators and torture Elser to find this information
They also round up members of his family from his home village including Else Härlen a married woman Elser has been seeing
When Else Härlen is brought before Elser he fears for her life and tells the police chief Arthur Nebe and Gestapo head Heinrich Müller that he acted alone procuring detonators from a steel factory and stealing dynamite from a nearby quarry
He outlines the two clockwork mechanisms he built to time the explosion and hopefully kill Hitler as he made a speech
Still believing Elser could not have attempted the assassination alone he once more tortured using drugs but with the same result as before he confirms acted alone
Through flashbacks we learn how Elser came to despise the Nazis and how he saw that Hitler needed to be removed to save Germany
We learn that following his arrest Elser was kept in concentration camps for five years and was shot a few days before American forces liberated Dachau concentration camp
Elser is now regarded a German resistance hero of the Second World War

In 2002 Bolivian politician Pedro Castillo hires an American political consulting firm to help him win the 2002 Bolivian presidential election
The firm brings in Jane Bodine to manage the campaign in Bolivia
The opposition s political consultant is her nemesis fellow American Pat Candy
In Bolivia the situation is tense the indigenous people who are a majority in the country are protesting for a constitutional reform to get proper representation
The American consultants not knowing the language or the culture are persuaded by Bodine a burned out political strategist to follow a strategy of smear campaigning
However Castillo refuses to give permission for the team to do so
It is only after publishing a flyer accusing Castillo of a long ago affair does Castillo agree to smear his opponents likewise
In the following months the team exercises a strategy of declaring a crisis
They are planning on frightening the people so they would be persuaded to vote for the unsympathetic but known Castillo rather than the younger oppositions candidates
Also they publish photos of their enemy with a wanted Nazi war criminal in the background so that he has to deny being a Nazi
Castillo s bus is stopped by a group of protesters who don t want the International Monetary Fund in Bolivia
Castillo promises not to invite the IMF without a referendum
Eduardo a young volunteer of the Castillo campaign is deeply impressed by this
His loyalty comes mostly from the fact that Castillo who was President at the time took Eduardo on his arm during a rally in his town
Nevertheless his brothers are much more skeptical about Castillo
During the final debate Bodine cites a quote in her conversation with Candy which he gives to Rivera in his speech saying that a great man said it
Unfortunately the quote is actually from Goebbels the Nazi minister of propaganda and one of Hitler s closest allies
Castillo wins the vote by a small margin
As one of his first actions he invites the IMF thereby breaking his promise
The deeply disappointed Eduardo visits Bodine in her hotel who says that she is not responsible for Castillo s actions
In her eyes her job is done
The disillusioned Eduardo joins his brothers at a demonstration of people demanding change
The police arrive and the demonstration quickly turns into a riot
Bodine and her crew are with Candy on the way to the airport
All of them except Bodine already have jobs as political consultants in other countries
Bodine realizes that she brought a liar into office and leaves the car
At the demonstration she meets Eduardo
In a final clip of the TV interview she has been shown giving throughout the movie it s revealed that she is now the head of an organization that promotes Latin American solidarity

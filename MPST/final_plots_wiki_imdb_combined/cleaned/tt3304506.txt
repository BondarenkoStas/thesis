Humanity lives in the deepest reaches of explored space in a vast region known as The Frontier
It contains many well known and inhabited star systems but many more worlds remain uncharted
Most people will never travel this far away from normal civilization but for pioneers explorers mercenaries outlaws and soldiers the Frontier offers both adventure and opportunity
Major interplanetary corporations known as Hammond Robotics a major manufacturing aerospace and defense contractor used resources of the Frontier to make builds of mecha combatants such as Titans and Spectres
Titans are descendants of present day fledgling military exoskeletons
In addition to the obvious combat applications unarmed forms of Titans are used in heavy industries like cargo transport and deep space ship salvage
They are also used in special applications such as deep space search and rescue and are very effective in inhospitable environments
The use of Titans is widespread throughout the Frontier in both combat and civilian life
As with Titans the Frontier contains Pilots of many different styles and experiences
Titan Pilots are rated by certifications most of which apply to civilian applications such as construction shipping and heavy salvage industries
The most prestigious of these is the Full Combat Certification a widely published series of tests that grade a Titan Pilot s abilities
Because of the extreme physical and mental challenges of mastering both Titan combat dismounted parkour movement a fully combat certified Titan pilot is a rare find and the combat skills of active Pilots in the field varies widely throughout the Frontier
The Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation otherwise known as the IMC started out small in natural resource extraction industries under the name Hammond Engineering
Increasing demand for Titan manufacturing materials combined with Hammond s market cornering planetary survey technology and map database rights contributed to explosive growth for the company
Over the course of a century a series of acquisitions mergers and re brandings lead to the transformation of Hammond Engineering into the ruthless commercial empire that is the IMC
With the Frontier s valuable shipping lanes and vast planetary resources ripe for exploitation the IMC is dedicated to maximizing profits and shareholder wealth using the legal application of force when necessary
The Frontier Militia represents the military arm of the Frontier systems territorial defense pact
The Militia is a loosely governed mishmash of homesteaders bandits mercenaries and pirates all rising up as citizen soldiers when the need arises
Each brigade within the Militia is responsible for fighting in an assigned section of Frontier territory
Although some brigades are little more than vast pirate organizations the Militia has enough resources to be a real obstacle to the IMC s ambitions on the Frontier
The Militia often claims that direct action against the IMC is in the best interest of the homesteaders whom they allegedly represent but not everyone on the Frontier sees it that way
Eventually a war broke out on the Frontier between the IMC and the Militia known as the Titan Wars
Hammond Robotics distributed many resources to these factions mainly the IMC to use combatants such as Titans Spectres and Marvin created technology for advanced warfare
Militia commanders such as Sarah and Cheng Bish Lorck struggle against the IMC led by Vice Admiral Marcus Graves
During the events of Titanfall Pilots Grunts Spectres and Titans of the IMC and Militia go through stages of war in multiple locations

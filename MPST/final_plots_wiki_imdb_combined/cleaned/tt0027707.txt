Colima County Texas has barred the entry of cattle from fever ridden Sage County where two unscrupulous schemers Morhan and Conner have raised thousands of head of the cattle suffering from Texas Cattle Fever
The cattle are secretly owned by leading citizen Dave Morgan
While driving the diseased cattle to a railhead for shipping they cross a corner of Colima Country and are spotted and fired upon by Marjorie Miller daughter of Sheriff Ed Miller
The outlaws are about to kidnap the girl when Gene Autry Frog Millhouse and Shorty arrive on the scene and rescue the girl
Gene and his sidekicks are traveling with Professor Parker s traveling medicine show
Morgan stages a town meeting and tries to prove that the fever is not contagious with the help of quack veterinarian Dr Schaefer
Morgan s plan is foiled by Professor Parker a real veterinarian who emphatically states that the disease is contagious
After the townspeople run Schaefer out of town and vote to support the quarantine Connor orders Gene to leave town by five o clock or face the consequences
Gene makes it clear that he is staying and Professor Parker and his troupe conduct their show
Meanwhile Sheriff Miller and Deputy Clark are riding on the trail and discussing the case when they are ambushed by Connor and Sam who leave the lawmen for dead
Gene and Frog find the lawmen Clark is dead but Miller is still alive
Gene decides to keep their discovery secret until they can find Clark s killer
Meanwhile Morgan is determined to get his henchman Frank Hall elected sheriff so that he can drive his infected cattle to auction
The opposing candidate is driven away by threats from Morgan s men
The people then nominate Gene to run against Hall
Desperate to undermine Gene s cadidacy Morgan finds Miller s handcuffs and badge in Gene s hotel room and accuses Gene of killing Miller
he tries to have him arrested but Gene escapes
With little hope of Gene winning the election now Marjorie organizes the town s women and all of them convince their men to vote for Gene who wins the election by a landslide
Morgan and his men make one last attempt to drive their cattle across the county
Gene organizes a posse and goes after Morgan s men
Following a shootout they chase Morgan and Connor and trick them into revealing that they know where Miller and Clark were hidden thereby confirming their guilt
Sheriff Miller congratulates Gene and Frog as they put Morgan and Connor in jail
With peace restored in the town Professor Parker s traveling medicine show moves on

Jigsaw I mean the Puppetmaster wraps a man and woman in plastic and leaves them in a warehouse full of dolls and candles
He talks to them over a loudspeaker and plays a video of him taunting a topless woman with an axe
They keep finding other people in the warehouse but they always die within minutes of being found
Instead of looking for a way out they spend their time talking about how the situation is just like HP Lovecraft s the Tomb
There are flashbacks that show how the prisoners wronged the puppetmaster in the past
Eventually the two main characters find an asian woman who does not immediately die so for some reason they kill her
The woman kills the man and exits the warehouse through a door which was wide open
A car is waiting for her with a bunch of money and a copy of the titular book
She goes to a motel and some guy asks her to have sex so she can keep the car and the money
She kills him too and we reach the merciful end Based on a story by the master of outrageous horror H P

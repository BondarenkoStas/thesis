After a dice game one night in the Oklahoma oil town of Richfield out of work engineer Buzz Doyle is broke
Another gambler Reno Sebastian has been cleaned out too but hostess Terry Miller tips them off that her boss Walter Karns the big winner was cheating with loaded dice
Reno has a ranch and an oil well that has not yet produced
He invites Buzz to come work for him and Terry who is close to Reno thinks it s a good idea because Reno s got just 45 days to strike oil or the well will go to his sister Lilli as stipulated in their father s will
Lilli has hated Reno ever since he killed her fiance during a fight while they were gambling
Lilli is determined to get all his holdings now and will stop at nothing
She even tries to seduce Buzz into abandoning Reno and working for her and when that doesn t work Lilli threatens that something bad will happen to Buzz if he stands in her way
The corrupt Karns is in love with Lilli and will do her bidding
Reno is found dead
Lilli is found by the body
But in his will Reno has left his ranch to Terry not to his sister
To sort out who s entitled to what Terry and Buzz seek the advice of Corpus P Mills a tipsy attorney who represented the father of Reno and Lilli before he died
Next it is Lilli who is found dead
Terry now stands to inherit everything the ranch and the oil well both but Buzz warns her this means Terry also could be the next victim
Karns comes along but to everyone s surprise Karns is killed too by a totally sober Corpus Mills who has been masterminding this scheme from the start eliminating family members so that he can claim the well for himself
His crimes don t pay however and in the end Terry and Buzz get each other and a gusher of oil

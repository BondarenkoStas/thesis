Sometime after the events of the previous film in Romania a female anaconda and a male anaconda are being held in a genetic research facility owned by Wexel Hall for experimentation
The research project is led by Dr Amanda Hayes and funded by J D
Murdoch a well known industrialist
While visiting the facility Murdoch provokes the male anaconda with a large flashlight and has it gassed to calm it down
However as Murdoch his assistant Pinkus and Daryl are about to leave the anaconda kills Daryl and breaks through his enclosure s wall
As it escapes it kills many of the people working in the lab
In looking through the facility Amanda and Professor Eric Kane realize that the second anaconda has also escaped
Murdoch calls in a team of animal hunters led by Hammett to capture both snakes
Amanda and Pinkus go with them
At a small farm in the middle of the woods the owner is eaten alive by one of the snakes
The hunting party arrives later and begin formulating a plan of attack
During the first confrontation with the snake two of the party are killed Gronzy is stabbed by the genetically altered anaconda s very sharp tail and Dragosh gets his head bitten off by the snake
Hammett arrives and gives the team a lecture on how to kill the snake
As the group splits up Amanda heads off in a car with two other team members Victor and Sofia
During the next confrontation with the snake the anaconda spits acidic venom in Victor s face burning it
The car crashes and Sofia is thrown off the car broke her leg
As Amanda tries to leave the car to help her the snake reappears and devours Sofia
Amanda is rescued by Hammett and both of them escape
As they regroup Amanda reluctantly reveals that the queen snake is pregnant and will give birth to more genetically special offspring in less than 24 hours
The teams want to call in the military but Hammett forbids it and threatens Amanda with jail for her role in creating it
In the morning the party begins searching for the snake but Pinkus has his hand bitten off by the anaconda and is killed
While Hammett searches for the snake on foot Amanda and one of the three remaining hunters Nick spot the snakes going into an old factory follow them in to plant explosives around the building
Before they can finish the male attacks
Nick helps Amanda escape but is wounded by the snake as it impales him with its tail but Nick is able to discharge a grenade killing both him and the snake
Hammett and his last remaining hunter Andrei arrive heard the grenade goes off
As the two of them meet Amanda inside the factory Andrei moves to set the charges but Hammett kills him causing Amanda to realize that Hammett is working for Murdoch wanting a live baby anaconda
Inside the building the queen gives birth
After wounding Hammett Amanda sets the timer on the explosives and escapes from the building leaving Hammett to be attacked by the baby snakes while he tries to reach the bomb
Once she is at a safe distance the explosives detonate killing Hammett and the baby snakes
As she squats by a roadside burning all of her documentation on the snake research one of Murdoch s men drives by heading for the factory where he finds one baby snake still alive and delivers the snake to Murdoch

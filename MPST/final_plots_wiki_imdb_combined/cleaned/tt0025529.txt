Jack Ellery is staging a lavish musical revue starring Eric Lander Ann Ware and Rita Ross supported by a cast of a hundred background singers dancers and two full orchestras
On opening night just before the show somebody tries to kill Ware several times
Ellery calls in police lieutenant Murdock of the homicide squad to investigate
During the show a private detective and then Rita are murdered
Ellery hides this from the rest of the performers claiming the victims are just sick and talks Murdock into investigating while the revue continues on otherwise Ellery will go broke
Several twists and turns follow but finally the murders are solved just after the show ends
In the last scene Nancy a squeaky pretty blonde showgirl finally gets to tell Ellery and Murdock what she has attempted to tell Ellery several times throughout the show
However he kept putting her off she was just trying to gain his attention and he was too busy staging the show
She actually had a vital piece of information that would have solved the first murder much sooner and might have prevented the second murder
Now that the show is over and a success Ellery s attention is finally on her and they go out for the night to celebrate
She giggles once again and moves off stage left in front of him and then Oakie breaks the fourth wall just momentarily looking into the camera with a devilish grin before he follows her

When Krane steals the serum and begins combining it with spinal fluid from recently murdered victims he is able to experience a host of sensations the primary one being the actual visual memory of the murderer in the cases
The major threat to the serum is that it puts tremendous pressure of the human sensory system and can lead to heart attacks in humans
When Dr Briggs realizes that he has stolen his serum and is abusing it she is both fascinated but alarmed and tries to stop him or at least attend to him given his drive to continue self administering the dangerous formula

When Krane gains possession of his own wife s spinal fluid and with Dr Briggs assistance injects himself with it the results bring about the discovery and involvement of more than he considered

At this point Michael says he knows a story they haven t heard of yet and promises that this story will give them the willies
Bad Apples A young boy named Danny struggles at his school with bullies and an overbearing impatient teacher
The only one who shows him any sympathy is the school custodian Mr Jenkins
While on duty Mr Jenkins disappears in the bathroom and Danny enters later to find Mr Jenkins body with a detached head and a humanoid monster lurking in the stall
Danny tells his teacher who goes into the bathroom to investigate only to be killed by the monster
Danny lures the bullies into the bathroom and they too are killed
It is soon revealed that Mr Jenkins was the monster all the time with his body being a disguise
Mr Jenkins moves to another school where it is revealed that he is still targeting bullies
Interlude Michael explain that his father the brothers Uncle Henry knew Mr Jenkins personally hence the accuracy of the story
Kyle and Josh say they have an even stranger story to tell
Flyboy Gordy Belcher is a reclusive mischievous kid who often plays pranks on others and who is overly obsessed with flies
He becomes fascinated with a secret manure created by Farmer Spivey which causes crops to grow in increased sizes
He often steals the manure from the old man much to Spivey s chagrin
After being kicked out of the school after tricking a girl into eating flies Gordy stops by Spivey s farm where the old man offers him a special manure with new ingredients as a way to call a truce
Gordy goes home to find his mother has thrown away all his flies save for three he kept in a hiding spot
He places them in the jar of manure which causes the flies to grow to an immense size overnight
They attack Gordy when he wakes up and the boy s parents find him with blood stumps where his arms and legs had been
Gordy awakes the next day with prosthetic replacements
Epilogue The brothers explain that Gordy is now made fun of by the kids he used to pick on
Michael is incredulous to which the brothers contend that Michael s story was far less believable
At that point Uncle Henry arrives and the brothers ask him to prove the story about Mr Jenkins
Uncle Henry then rips off his face revealing the humanoid monster from Bad Apples

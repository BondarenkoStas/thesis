Lt
Commander Thomas Dodge is about to be passed over a third time for his own nuclear submarine
The reasons given are his unorthodox command methods an unfortunate brushing incident with a Russian submarine and after the incident the rumor of a genital tattoo received after getting blind drunk while on shore leave
Failure to secure a submarine will result in Dodge being dropped from the navy s command program and that means he will resign his commission
During his career Tom Dodge has made an enemy of Rear Admiral Yancy Graham who strongly speaks out against Dodge s promotion
Vice Admiral Dean Winslow ComSubLant on the other hand likes Dodge and his unorthodox methods
A war game is planned to test the navy s defenses against possible attack from older Soviet diesel powered submarines in the hands of America s enemies
Among the defenses being tested is Dodge s prior billet the Los Angeles class submarine USS Orlando
Dodge is selected to put the World War II era Balao class diesel sub USS Stingray back in commission as the war game s Opposing Force
Winslow tells him to think like a pirate promising Dodge that if he can sink a target ship placed in Norfolk Harbor Dodge will be considered for a permanent command
Motivated by his dislike for Dodge and his own ambition for promotion Graham handpicks a crew from hell for Stingray hot tempered uptight Lt Martin Pascal as the Executive Officer crusty Chief Engineer Howard a civilian contractor familiar with the obsolete Balao class s diesel electric engine system rebellious Engineman 1st Class Brad Stepanek sharp eared Sonarman 2nd Class E T
Sonar Lovacelli compulsive gambler Seaman Stanley Spots Sylvesterson former college basketball player Seaman Jefferson R J Jackson who has dreams of playing in the NBA shock prone Electrician s Mate Nitro and not so Culinary Specialist Second Class Buckman as Stingray s cook
Graham also uses Stingray as a Navy pilot program to evaluate women serving on submarines knowing the cramped diesel boat is unsuitable for mixed gender living and Surface Warfare Officer Lt Emily Lake joins the crew as Diving Officer
Using unorthodox tactics and a major storm to offset their huge technological disadvantage Dodge and his crew achieve their first objective by sneaking in to Charleston Harbor and setting off signal flares
Now desperate to defeat Dodge Graham cuts the war game containment area in half without Winslow s authorization
Failing in their first attempt at Norfolk Harbor Dodge leaves the reduced containment area and heads out to sea
Irate at this lapse in protocol the always strident and by the book Pascal attempts to take command of the Stingray the crew does not supports his action
Dodge then charges Pascal with mutiny and in mock pirate fashion forces his blindfolded XO to walk the plank into the raised fishing net of a waiting trawler that will take him ashore
During Stingray s second attempt at Norfolk Graham assumes personal control of Orlando
Dodge employs an incredibly dangerous maneuver to sneak past the ships and aircraft protecting Norfolk
Orlando is eventually able to locate and chase her down
Before the Orlando s shooting solution is obtained Dodge is able to fire two live torpedoes at long range into the anchored target ship at Norfolk winning the war game for Stingray
Upon his return to port Admiral Winslow chastises Graham and denies his promotion
He welcomes Dodge back and informs him that he will not get his own Los Angeles class submarine as the two had previously discussed but a new Seawolf class submarine plus a proper crew to man her
Dodge respectfully requests that his entire Stingray crew be transferred with him to his new command and then dismisses his crew to begin a well earned shore leave
As Dodge and Lake leave the dock she poses a query to him now that they better know each other What exactly is this tattoo I keep hearing about

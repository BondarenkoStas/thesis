It s the end of summer and two friends Taylor and Bert decide to drive from Italy to France in an old car a last hurrah before Taylor goes back home to study law
You find out during the course of film that Taylor comes from money his father is a doctor
Bert trusts Taylor with managing the finances because Bert doesn t have a lot of money but Taylor is more than generous The movie is paced deliberately with hints that youth is fleeting
The boys have a few clumsy attempts at being carefree and it s readily apparent that Bert is better at it that Taylor
Taylor is quiet and introspective and he is dependent on Bert to help bring him into social situations One day by chance Taylor is on his own when he meets Marty a woman he later comes to learn is on her own slumming it away from home in France because she didn t want to be anywhere near her mother and whatever number husband the mother is on
He likes her at once and he has the idea of inviting her along to journey with them back to France
They are to travel together but they are free to do whatever they want with two exceptions each pays their own way and they are not to be intimate with each other
Taylor can t find it in himself to ask so Bert does it and Marty accepts During the course of the arrangement even after a thinly veiled attempt to tell both of the men that she doesn t mind being with either or both of them Bert finds a local girl and disappears for a while leaving Marty and Taylor to their own devices
Marty tries to entice Taylor to sleep with her and even after a passionate embrace but in the end Taylor decides not to jeopardize the arrangement
He tells Marty indirectly that he s fallen for her and he ll send her letter from the boat on the way home After a drunken night out with Bert Taylor changes a little
He tries to be more carefree even talks of staying in France to go to school instead of going home
Bert has ended his fling and its back to the three of them traveling The boys are due to leave within a week or so when the three of them are picnicking by the ocean
They witness a boat accident and a man is in obvious distress
Bert and Marty are passive about it there s a boat in route and they believe the man will be fine
Taylor just can t stand watching this man struggle so he jumps into the ocean and swims out to help
He doesn t make it to the man as predicted a boat picks him up
As Taylor swims back something happens but he is shaken up by the experience Bert and Marty want to go out that night but Taylor declines
Bert says he ll see Taylor later and departs
Taylor has a fitful night of sleep the ocean haunting him
When he awakes Bert s bed hasn t been slept in and Taylor correctly assumes that Bert and Marty spent the night together Taylor leaves Bert his remaining money and a note takes the car and leaves because the covenant between the three has been broken

There was a star good at heart fine spirited with expectations
He grew with zeal for his music simple yet conducive of his nature which was cheerfully accepted by his close friends and family
He set out to the streets with his guitar in search of a passion for art running after the glory of Jim Morrison s fame his eclectic persona charmed all who listened to his music his aria
But there was a twist in his role that was played by Janardan the protagonist he did not see any side of romance since
He was imbued with the thrill of stardom by his mentor who said him the change in every true artist s life started with a pain an urge which led him instrumentally to an overture of a failed love and a falsely attained conspicuous success as an established musician
He was thrown out of his own family which was filled with wrath and hatred for him based on distrust
The movie had several prominent human emotions sprouting up one after another and used a stream of consciousness as it progressed keeping the capriccioso of the music tracks in harmony with every node of changing emotions It started with peace for Janardan as his life had simplicity while he set out for his journey
Following it were feelings of love when he fell for the beauty and lust of the dancing diva of the college Heer gorgeous arrogant and snobbishly cynical
Whilst these emotions marked the rungs in the story Janardan turned into notorious Jordan and his fan following grew overwhelmingly as he contracted a leading music enterprise
Then came along despair as Heer s marriage was certain to an affluent family both of them had very little to do about it but Jordan s parlous love began to be requited
Going along the flow despair was replaced with anger and fury in Jordan s life his heart started bleeding when he saw her closeness with her Prague based spouse Jai and felt she already belonged to him
The next emotion had to be frustration while gradually a sturdy possession worked up in him for his ladylove and it turned up in torrents
An outcast Jordan was charged with numerous criminal offences including resisting arrest and publicly assaulting on the media
Slowly but surely his pure feelings for Heer took to lust a sin which he was the last person to resist Jordan with his guitar and simple music and a pure serene heart transformed into a frenetic rock star with hysterical rock music a dark heart failed love and proving frustration his love for career was defaced took a wrong turn as his repressed love Heer the second side of the coin went to coma The last emotion peace is symbolic of a crux marked by the painful track tum ko pa hi liya reeking of a constant unfathomable pain rebel and frustration for Jordan and a climactic ordeal for Heer The movie is drenched by stunning music tracks suiting and marking every emotion distinctively courtesy the maestro A R Rahman

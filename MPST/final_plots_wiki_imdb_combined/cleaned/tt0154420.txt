Respected family patriarch and businessman Helge is celebrating his 60th birthday at the family run hotel
Gathered together amongst many family and friends are his wife Else his sullen eldest son Christian his well traveled daughter Helene and his boorish younger son Michael
Christian s twin sister Linda has recently taken her life at the hotel
Before the celebration dinner Helene finds Linda s suicide note but hides it in a medicine bottle after becoming upset by the contents
Michael fights with his wife whom he had earlier abandoned on the roadside with their three children and then has sex with her
Michael later is pulled aside by a waitress with whom he had an affair and then beats her when she disparages Helge
Later during dinner Christian makes a speech to the family in which he accuses his father Helge of sexually abusing him and his late sister Linda
There is an initial shocked silence but the party gradually returns to normal as the guests react by silent denial
In a private conversation in the pantry a seemingly baffled Helge asks Christian about his motivations for slandering him and Christian appears to recant his accusation
However Christian is spurred to further action by hotel chef Kim a childhood friend who knows about the abuse
Christian then stands up and continues his toast by accusing Helge of causing Linda s death
Helge speaks to Christian alone and threateningly offers to announce in a toast Christian s troubled personal history impotence with women and his perhaps inappropriately close relationship with his late sister Linda
Christian says nothing in response to the threat
Further exacerbating the tensions of the day Helene s black boyfriend Gbatokai shows up enraging the racist Michael who later leads most of the partygoers in singing the Danish song Jeg har set en rigtig negermand in a racist way to offend him
During a toast Else makes a series of back handed compliments towards her children accusing Christian of having an overactive imagination as a child and asking him to apologize for his earlier accusation
Christian responds by accusing her of interrupting Helge during one of the rapes yet not interfering with the incident and calling her a cunt
Michael and two other guests violently eject Christian from the hotel
When Christian walks back in they beat Christian and tie him to a tree in the nearby woods
Christian unties himself and returns to the house
Helene has a headache and asks one of the waitresses to go and fetch her pills
Pia finds Linda s suicide note in the medicine bottle and gives it to Christian
Christian gives the suicide note to Helene and leaves a note with the toastmaster
The toastmaster reads aloud the note that urges Helene to read the suicide note to the guests
Helene does so
Linda s note states that she decided to kill herself after feeling overwhelmed by dreams in which her father was molesting her again
In a fit of anger Helge admits to the abuse in front of all the guests by saying that it was all Christian was good for
He then leaves the dining room with the guests stunned
Christian who is drunk faints after walking out of the dining hall and imagines seeing Linda
When he awakes he learns from Helene that Michael is missing
We learn that the drunken Michael has called Helge outside and then beat his father severely promising him that he will never see his grandchildren again
Next morning shows the family and guests eating breakfast nonchalantly
Then Helge comes in and speaks to the group admitting his wrongdoing and declaring his love for his children
Michael coolly dismisses their father from the table stating that he should now leave so that they can have breakfast
Christian reveals that he is going back to Paris and asks Pia to accompany him

In the near future in Czechoslovakia a space flight is in the final stages of preparation
As the astronauts are being interviewed Joseph the upholsterer is gluing the last bits of padding in place
Joseph is lazy and incompetent and always complaining the classic goof off who tries to shift blame to anywhere but him
While his supervisor berates him for being behind schedule via the communicator screen in the ship Joseph manages to kick the takeoff switch and the rocket takes off into space with him as the only passenger Next we see Joseph returning home in the ship with an alien companion from the Blue Star named Adam
The viewer never sees Adam s home world but we learn that he has accompanied Joseph home to learn more about the pattern of humans
Adam looks exactly like a human except for a slightly larger hairless cranium
His clothes are very futuristic even more so than those the humans are wearing when they reach Earth
After landing Adam uses a small handheld device of his to become invisible the better to observe the humans Joseph discovers to his surprise that 500 years have passed
During an interview with the local government administrators and scientists Joseph is amused then he administrator asks him When did socialism come to Luxembourg
and he responds Socialism
Radio Luxembourg
Oh boy
In turn they laugh at him when he asks Is this the East or the West
with the obvious implication that the East prevailed over the years and everything is now a happy worker s Socialist paradise He IS from the First Century
Everyone he sees is happy and content with modern conveniences everywhere and no apparent conflicts anywhere
War appears to be a thing of the past Joseph is given a guide a new apartment and access to a machine that can deliver anything a person wants to select from a catalog
Confronted with the ability to fulfill his every desire he goes wild with gluttony and begins tearing pages from the catalog and feeding them into the machine
Dozens of boxes of stuff appear including a giraffe which seems to be the ultimate symbol of consumption for its own sake
This begins to make the locals wonder if there s not something wrong with The Man from The First Century and they decide he s been infected with greedyitis Ultimately Joseph is called upon to explain himself and is interviewed by people from around the world via television
Joseph s self importance and lack of knowing anything important even about his own time disgusts the assembled viewers and they begin to drop out of the meeting
Desperate for attention Joseph claims to have discovered a new fuel source he invented on the Blue Star which brings renewed interest in him
Of course he knows nothing about the subject and convinces Adam to help him as part of his continued study of humans
Adam agrees but his studies are beginning to show that Joseph is quite different from the other humans on Earth and he begins to distrust Joseph Much of the movie is Joseph making a complete buffoon of himself everywhere he goes a museum a bar etc
He can t fit in because everyone else is happy and content with their lives while Joseph is still his old incompetent greedy and blame shifting self A love interest is introduced by the characters Peter and Eve young scientists who are obviously in love and want to marry but Peter is depressed because he doesn t have a dowry and can t make the offer
The fuel formula figures prominently in this subplot and in the denouement is presented by Adam to Peter and Eve as a gift Because you re in love
Ultimately Joseph s increasing inability to fit in begins to disgust his hosts and they begin to reject him and in a fit of near madness Joseph tells them about Adam and claims that he is studying Earth in order to attack it with advanced weapons
Joseph is finally sent off to the sanitarium to have his greedyitis cured and while there sees via the video screen when Adam greets the others and declares his peaceful intentions Why would thinking beings want to make war with one another
Realizing he s ruined Joseph sneaks out of the hospital and makes his way back to the rocketship where he takes off intending to go back to the Blue Star
Adam is watching with the others on the video screen and alters the rocket s course to send him back to where he came
The final shot is the administrator breaking the Fourth Wall and speaking directly to us Look out people
He s coming back to YOU

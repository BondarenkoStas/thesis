Appeared to take place right after the events of Demonic Toys an unknown stranger with a pair of gloved hands picks up the pieces of the destroyed toys and starts stitching them together
The only toys the perpetrator could fix correctly were Baby oopsie daisy and Jack Attack
The unidentified man then puts the toys in a crate and is handed over a suitcase full of cash by another man who then leaves with the toys
Also with Dr Lorca is his sweetheart Lauraline and her stepson David and a little woman named Lillith who is a psychic of some sorts
Dr Lorca s driver Eric accidentally drops a crate that Dr Lorca wants brought into the house revealing the Demonic Toys inside it
It is revealed that Dr Lorca is still collecting oddity toys
He s arrived because Caitlin called and told him about an oddity toy she found within the castle that s able to move
The castle s current owners seldom come there meaning they re superstitious of everything that s happened in there
The owners decided to empty and sell it to Italian government to make it a historical landmark and keep it open for the public
Caitlin takes them inside the castle and gives them its history
The doll itself was hand carved out of wood with a mixture of fabric elements
Caitlin opens the box and shows them the doll Divoletto
Mr Butterfield examines the toy and claims it is the oldest toy he s ever seen made possibly in the 14th century
Caitlin then shows them how it moves
Just tap a wand on the side of the box a couple of times and then it will come to life
After a while the toy finally moves
Caitlin believes that there are magnets in the wand and when the box is tapped it sets off the springs and mechanisms inside of Divoletto
However Lillith thinks differently
Eric suddenly runs in the room and tells them that their cars are gone
Since everything is closed and have no transportation to get back to Rome Caitlin suggests that they stay at the castle for the night
Meanwhile Lillith examines Divoletto to catch a vision of some sorts and sees a vision of the future where Divoletto s killing them all
David then smashes Divoletto s head with a shovel but it s revealed that Divoletto was one of Fiora s personal demons
The demon then sucks Fiora s spirit out of Lillith and brings her through the portal back to hell
The demonic toys then attack them and David cuts their heads off with the shovel killing them
The next day David Caitlin and a spooked out Lillith leave the castle with the demonic toys remains so no one else can find them along with the clay vessels containing Fiora s personal demons
The sound of glass shatter is heard and the painting of Fiora at the castle starts whispering implying that Fiora s revenge personal demon has been released

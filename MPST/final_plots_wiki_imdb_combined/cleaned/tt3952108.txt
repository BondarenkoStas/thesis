After a ghost scares a family out of their house an insurance company hires three ghost hunters to determine if it is haunted
They include Liam who handles their technological tools skeptic Scott and psychic Holly
At first Holly senses nothing in the house and Scott s tools measure no electromagnetic disturbances
After Liam sets up several cameras with sensors they go to sleep
At 3am the cameras pick up movement which Scott later dismisses as a draft
As Liam and Scott discuss their previous cases Scott describes his theory that low frequency sound can disperse a ghost and Liam shows Holly footage of a chair rocking by itself
Scott admits that he can not explain the footage and says he wants to find a scientific explanation for the paranormal
A loud noise wakes the ghost hunters at 3am the next night and Holly says she sees a ghostly figure which neither of the men can see
In the morning Scott tells them nobody will accept their evidence as it is too subjective
Although frustrated Liam and Holly eventually agree and the three go through each room trying to make contact
Before going to sleep they set alarms to wake just before 3am
That night Holly sees the ghostly figure again and it reacts aggressively threatening her
Scott calms the others by telling them that there is no evidence a ghost has ever harmed a living person all it can do is scare them
Holly more shaken than the others reveals she took the job to conquer her fear of ghosts
During the day Holly senses a presence and strong temperature change which the others do not feel
Scott s EMF meter reads nothing but he soon realizes he forgot to insert a battery
When he does so it immediately begins reading a large disturbance
The reading suddenly goes dead at the end of the main hallway and Holly agrees that there is no presence in the kitchen
This is reinforced when the ghost later chases them and they take refuge in the kitchen
Worried that the attacks could turn dangerous Liam and Holly argue they should leave the house
Scott however insists they stay to capture evidence of the paranormal
When they subsequently film a telekinetic attack by flying furniture Scott again insists they stay this time to test his theory
Liam who owns their transportation reluctantly agrees overriding Holly s objections
During the ghost s next appearance Liam restarts the house s generator while Scott sets up his equipment
After the machine reaches its lowest frequency the attack suddenly ends and Holly admits that the ghost is gone
As the relieved ghost hunters pack up their equipment Liam notices a strangely cold corner in the kitchen
Upon further investigation a hidden passage leads to another room
There they discover the mummified remains of a woman
Overwhelmed by a paranormal presence Holly is forced to leave the room and the others call the police who after looking say there is no body in the room
As the ghost hunters attempt to convince the police officers of their story Holly is suddenly possessed and reveals that the first ghost was trying to frighten them off and protect them from the second the woman
The second ghost quickly kills the police officers then Scott
Liam saves Holly only to be killed himself
As Holly flees the house the ghost kills her In the final Scene the ghost killer finally shows itself and the credits roll

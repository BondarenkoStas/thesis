Over the last 25 years there has existed a group of senior citizens living in Northampton Massachusetts who refuse to let age and ill health get them down
Young Heart is a documentary based on the lives of the current singing group of 24 senior citizens brought to the big screen by British filmmaker Stephen Walker who saw their performance in London
Young Heart is not your ordinary singing chorus because they sing rock punk disco and the average age is 81 with the oldest being 92 year old Eileen Hall
The documentary follows the group over a six week rigorous rehearsal schedule plus practicing at home for an upcoming sold out concert in their home town
The group has many songs in their repertoire but Bob Cilman the stern but sympathetic chorus director has added several songs for the new concert
These are not easy for the group to learn such as Yes We Can Schizophrenia and I Got You or
After several weeks of practice the group is on their way to the local jail to give a performance when they learn that one of their members passed away the night before
It is devastating for them but they have learned that the show must go on
They all pull together and practice even harder to get ready for their evening performance
That night their concert is a rousing success and ends with a standing ovation

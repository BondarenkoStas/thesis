Sherry Swanson a young woman who has recently been released from prison and is recovering from a heroin addiction is trying to rebuild her life on the outside
Above all she wants to repair her relationship with her young daughter Alexis
She returns home to Jersey and goes to the halfway house where she will be staying
Before she can reunite with Alexis she meets with her Parole officer who is very strict and direct with his expectations of her
He tells her that she needs to stay clean and get a job
While doing some chores around the house Sherry meets the director of the recovery program and Sherry knowing that he is attracted to her sleeps with him in the basement
Afterwards her brother Bobby picks her up to go see Alexis
Alexis lives with Sherry s brother Bobby and his wife Lynn
Her daughter immediately recognizes her and calls her mommy which warms Sherry s heart
She gives Alexis a few presents and talks to her about why she was away saying that she stole from people for drugs
The halfway house where she lives proves to be more daunting as Sherry has tension with a fellow housemate but finds solace in hanging her daughter s artwork she sent to Sherry in prison
She goes to a job interview and says that she wants to work with children as she took classes in prison and also wants to be a better parent for her daughter
He rebuffs her telling her that a pretty girl like her should be a waitress but can t since she has a history with alcohol and drugs
Obviously attracted to Sherry she shows the director of the employment program her breasts and says that she will suck his dick in order to get the job she wants
She does so
After her interview she goes to an AA meeting and talks about the stress of life outside prison is making her want to use
She also meets Dean a former alcoholic
He gives her a ride home and he tells her that he recognizes her from when she was a 16 year old stripper at one of the local spots
After calling her brother and faced with more excuses as to why she can t talk to Alexis she gets into an altercation with another housemate
Upset she leaves the house and catches a ride to her brother s place
She sleeps on their steps and Lynn finds her in the morning
There she sees Alexis getting ready for summer camp
While Lynn finishes getting Alexis ready for camp Sherry talks to her brother Bobby about moving in because she feels the halfway house is like prison
He tells her that she can stay but there can t be any drugs in the house
Alexis runs in to say goodbye as she is about to leave and calls Sherry by her name and not mommy which she had done so earlier
Angered by Lynn s interference with her daughter she punches the kitchen cabinet
Later that day Sherry s father Bob and his wife come over
Sherry is overwhelmingly glad to see her father and acts like a child trying to get his attention from Alexis to her
They share a kiss and an inappropriate embrace which makes the family uncomfortable
They all have burgers around the table together and Bob hands Sherry a beer
She drinks it even though she is on parole
She decides to sing for everyone obviously for her father s attention
Later while playing with Alexis Lynn and Sherry have a confrontation
Sherry yells at her and tells her that she is confusing her with the name switches and accuses her of being jealous
Bobby gives Sherry some cash and drives her to a hotel saying that there are too many people in the house
Sherry berates him and reminds him that she is his sister not a charity case
While at the hotel she cuts and dyes her hair brown
She also calls Dean while drinking and asks him to come over
The two sleep together and talk
The next day she meets with her parole officer and faces a body search
She yells at them saying that she is stronger than they think
Her parole officer tells her that she has gotten a job at a local youth center
She is ecstatic and thanks him
After her first shift with the kids at the center she goes to Dean s house but much to her dismay he has another woman in his house
Unknown to Sherry her parole officer is following her
She goes to a liquor store and comes back
The two talk more and Dean tells her that he does like her
Later at the hotel Sherry calls Bobby asking to talk to Alexis
He gives her another excuse but tells her that they are having a birthday party for her
Sherry says that she will be there and hangs up
Before the party she goes shopping for presents for Alexis
Dean gives her a ride to Bobby s but they aren t at the house
Flustered she asks Dean to drive to her father s house
Bobby greets her and asks why she is late
She is greeted by her father who hands her a drink and Sherry then gives her gifts to Alexis
She is happy and thanks Sherry
Another child opens one of her gifts and Alexis yells at him that they are her presents as she starts to cry
Lynn picks her up and brings all the kids to the other room for musical chairs
Upset Sherry breaks down to her dad saying that everyone is trying to keep Alexis away from her and she doesn t know what to do
Her father tells her to give it some time as she leans on him
He slowly caresses her breasts and kisses her shoulder insinuating that Bob sexually abused Sherry as a child which is why she turned to drugs
Her brother sees this and turns away
Disgusted with herself and her father she flees
Sherry then relapses
She buys heroin and snorts it in her hotel room
She then uses the rest of her money to buy more drugs and shoots up with a stranger
In the morning she wanders into an AA meeting and meets Dean
He knows that she is messed up and takes back to his place
He burns sage around her and draws her a bath
The next morning Dean wakes her and tells her that she needs to stop being so selfish and if so maybe Alexis with come to her on her own
She goes to work and sings with the kids at the center and goes back to her hotel
Her parole officer is waiting for her and asks what is going on
Sherry tells him that she isn t clean and he berates her about how she wants to be clean but she doesn t want to do the work and she wants her daughter back but she doesn t want to do the work
He tells her that she will have to be admitted to a hospital to get clean since she doesn t qualify to be an out patient
He tells her to take the weekend to say goodbye to her family and Monday he will take her in
Later she meets with her brother
He tells her that he hasn t forgotten that she is his sister and that he wants her and Alexis to build a relationship
She calls him a snake and says that she can t trust him because of Lynn and his actions against her with Alexis
He reminds her that they love Alexis and the only reason they have her is because of Sherry
She asks to take Alexis out by herself so she isn t afraid of Sherry anymore
He agrees
Sherry packs her suitcase and goes to pick up Alexis who is unwilling to go
Sherry holding it together doesn t argue with Lynn as Bobby packs Alexis into the car
Alexis is insistent on not going and starts to cry but Bobby reassures her that this her chance to get to know her mother
Sherry drives off and crosses state lines into Delaware with Alexis which is a violation of her parole
The two stop for food and while going waiting on line for the bathroom Sherry witnesses another mother yelling and cursing at her child
Sherry grabs her by the hair and tells her that she is lucky to have her kid threatens her and calls her a bully
As she turns around Alexis is gone
Sherry finds her in the bath stall crying as she wet her pants
She carries her to the car and changes her pants
Sherry asks Alexis to say that she loves her and she does so
Realizing that her daughter doesn t actually love her and in some ways is scared of her Sherry drives back to Jersey and drops Alexis off with Bobby and Lynn
She talks with Bobby outside and tells him that she actually can t take of Alexis by herself
She asks him to help and he agrees
Sherry then drives off

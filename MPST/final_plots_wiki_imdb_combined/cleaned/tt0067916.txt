The series is set in ancient Pompeii
Howerd played a slave Lurcio the other main characters were Lurcio s bumbling old master Senator Ludicrus Sextus the senator s promiscuous wife Ammonia his daughter Erotica and his eternally virginal son Nausius along with the Cassandra esque Senna the Soothsayer and in series one Plautus
Guest stars included several actresses from the Carry On film series including Barbara Windsor Wendy Richard and Valerie Leon
The format was little more than a backdrop for an endless series of double entendres and risqu√© gags
Howerd was central to most of the gags and he started each episode with a prologue a to camera piece that was seldom concluded and rarely had anything to do with the episode s plot
Thirteen 30 minute episodes were made in two series
In addition there was a pilot episode and two special episodes entitled Further Up Pompeii one in 1975 and the other written by Brian Leveson and Paul Minett in 1991
The latter sparked speculation that there could be a new series but Howerd s death in 1992 put an end to any such prospect
Apart from the change to the actor playing Ludicrus Sextus there are some differences between the two series of Up Pompeii the second series using noticeably fewer sets than the previous
This may have been due to the second series being commissioned filmed and broadcast within four months from the end of the first
The series was recorded in front of a live studio audience with whom Howerd interacted breaking the fourth wall
Also Howerd made anachronistic comments like I don t use that glycerine rubbish or The BBC told me when such things didn t exist in ancient times
Howerd addressed the audience using asides that the other characters couldn t hear often commenting on the script sometimes complaining that everyone else got the good lines

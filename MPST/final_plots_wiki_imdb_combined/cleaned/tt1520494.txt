In the near future where robotics have greatly evolved Alex is looking for the normal loving family that he doesn t have his parents are always too busy fighting with each other to worry about the effect on him
After seeing an advertisement for a domestic robot named Blinky he asks his parents for one for Christmas hoping that it will bring his family together as is shown in the advert
Blinky s advertisement and conduct at this point indicate that Blinky is specifically designed to provide friendship to its masters
After obtaining Blinky and playing with him for a while shown in a home video style montage Alex feels disappointment in the fact that Blinky hasn t changed anything and his parents continue to argue
Eventually Alex becomes tired of the robot and ignores him even when Blinky persistently asks to play games
After leaving Blinky to count down from 1 million outside in the rain in a game of Hide and Seek Alex becomes frustrated and gives Blinky multiple conflicting orders such as telling him to be still and at the same time cleaning up as well as telling him to kill both his parents himself and everyone else in his rage leading Blinky to malfunction
After Alex informs his mother about the glitched robot and that they need to buy a new one she suggests rebooting him and that Alex must clean up the mess he made or she will tell Blinky to clean him up and cook him for dinner
Alex reboots Blinky appearing to have reverted to factory settings and asking Alex will you be my best friend
Alex continues to ignore Blinky as normal
Soon afterwards Blinky starts to behave abnormally such as showing up in Alex s room overnight and continuing the count down from before
The next day the family dog appears to be gone with Alex believing that the robot had something to do with it
Alex goes into another rage with Blinky throwing an electronic tablet at him
The tablet simply shatters glass throughout the room causing no damage to Blinky
Alex gets even angrier and blames the mess on Blinky so Blinky retreats to the kitchen to clean counting down from 10 and grabbing an electric knife from the drawers proclaiming ready or not here I come
That evening both parents are eating dinner at the table with Blinky present and Alex s seat empty
As Alex s mother asks Blinky if he has seen Alex the robot replies that he is right there at the table and reveals that he has carried out the mother s command from before he has killed Alex and cooked him into meatballs which they are now eating
The parents scream in horror as Blinky asks if he has done good
The police arrive at the house as Blinky is cleaning up supposedly the parents blood
He lets two officers into the house and shuts the door behind them
The last shot shows Blinky as he kills his next victim himself and the camera covered in blood as he carries out Alex s past commands to kill everybody

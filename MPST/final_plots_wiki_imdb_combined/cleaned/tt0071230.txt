In the American Old West of 1874 construction on a new railroad led by Lyle runs into quicksand
The route has to be changed which will require it to go through Rock Ridge a frontier town where everyone has the last name of Johnson
The conniving State Attorney General Hedley Lamarr wants to buy the land along the new railroad route cheaply by driving out the townspeople
He sends a gang of thugs led by his flunky assistant Taggart to scare them away prompting the townsfolk to demand that Governor William J
Le Petomane appoint a new sheriff
The Attorney General persuades the dim witted Le Petomane to select Bart a black railroad worker who was about to be hanged
Lamarr believes a black lawman will so offend the townspeople that they will either abandon Rock Ridge or lynch the new sheriff with either result paving the way for him to take over the town With his quick wits and the assistance of drunken gunslinger Jim also known as The Waco Kid Bart works to overcome the townsfolk s hostile reception
He defeats and befriends Mongo an immensely strong slow thinking henchman sent by Taggart and Lyle to kill Bart and then beats German seductress for hire Lili von Shtupp at her own game
Lamarr is furious that his plans keep failing and decides to destroy Rock Ridge with a newly recruited and diverse army of thugs Bart now has 24 hours to come up with a brilliant plan to save our town
He gathers the town along with the railroad workers 3 miles east of Rock Ridge to build a fake town as a diversion
The workers labor all night to complete their task
The sun rises on a fake town that s a perfect replica down to the orange roof on Howard Johnson s outhouse
Bart realizes the town has no people in it so it won t fool Lamarr s villains
Bart orders the townspeople to make exact replicas of themselves and leaves with Jim and Mongo to execute a plan that will slow the villains to a crawl
The three construct a tollbooth labeled Le Petomane Thruway requiring Taggart s crew to pay 10 each to pass on their horses
Since no one in the raiding party has any change Taggart sends someone back to town to get a shitload of dimes Once through the tollbooth Lamarr s villains attack the fake town populated with dummies which Bart boobytrapped with several dynamite bombs
Bart tries setting off the bombs but is unsuccessful as the detonator does not work
Jim is given the task of exploding the bombs and fires his pistol at them
After the bombs explode launching villains skyward the Rock Ridgers attack the villains The resulting fight between the townsfolk and Lamarr s army of thugs breaks the fourth wall literally
The fight spills out from the Warner Bros film lot into a neighboring musical set being directed by Buddy Bizarre then into the studio commissary where a pie fight ensues
Taggart is knocked out when Mongo smashes his head on a cash register and the fight finally pours out into the surrounding streets
The citizens of Rock Ridge chase the villains back to town to destroy them but Lamarr takes a taxi


off this picture
He arrives at Grauman s Chinese Theatre to watch the premiere of Blazing Saddles
Unfortunately he sees on the movie screen that Bart has arrived outside the theatre
Bart ends up killing Lamarr by shooting him in the groin
Bart and Jim then go into the theatre to watch the end of the film
The film ends with Bart leaving Rock Ridge much to the sadness of the townspeople and the railroad workers for his work there is done
He intends to fight injustice in other parts of the world which the townspeople and the railroad workers dismiss as bullshit and Bart admits it s simply getting dull around there
As he rides off he finds Jim and the two decide to go off to nowhere special
They then hand in their horses and ride off into the sunset

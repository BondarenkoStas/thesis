Slipstream is set in a dystopian future following a global environmental disaster
A voice over at the beginning of the film explains that a doomsday event the Convergence has destroyed the balance of the world s weather systems with the result that the jet stream has expanded to the planet s surface with the surface scoured by winds far surpassing anything ever seen before destroying cities and entire nations
Many bizarre communities have survived in the valleys and caves some regressing to primitive states others embracing advanced technologies
Many are isolationist and some are attacked by marauding bandits
Ground transport is no longer possible due to the atmospheric conditions but skilled pilots can travel by air following the fierce winds and travelling with their flow a practice known as riding the slipstream
The remnants of society have therefore become airborne most now reside on high precipices or in caves beneath the howling Slipstream
It is also stated that nobody has ever been to the ends of the Slipstream because atmospheric conditions there make human survival impossible
The film opens with an unnamed man running down a canyon being harassed by an aeroplane which drives him onto a precipice
The plane lands and its occupants two bounty hunters Will Tasker and Belitski chase the man and shoot him through the arm with a grappling hook
The fugitive looks at his arm but seems intrigued rather than distressed
Tasker pulls on the rope and the man tumbles down the side of the canyon but once again is not harmed
Immediately after his fall the fugitive recites the words of famous World War II aviator and poet John Gillespie Magee Jr I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth put out my hand and touched the Face of God
from the poem High Flight
The bounty hunters take the man prisoner and fly to a busy civilian airstrip where he stands beside them handcuffed as they eat in the airstrip s diner
There they encounter Matt Owens a hustler and smalltime arms dealer
He makes a pass at Belitski and she nearly breaks his arm and he then tries to sell contraband grenades to Tasker
It is then revealed that Tasker and Belitski are part of the remnants of a law enforcement agency trying to keep the peace in what is left of society
Byron is wanted for murder and they are bringing him to justice
Tasker seizes Owens weapons but as the pair are leaving Owens kidnaps Byron so that he can claim the large reward for himself and they flee but not before Belitski shoots Owens with a dart both poisoning him and planting a tracking device in his body enabling Belitski and Tasker to follow the fugitives
Owens and Byron first fly to Owen s home Hell s Kitchen where Byron heals a boy blinded by cataracts and Owens begins to wonder if Byron is more than he appears
After getting lost they land at the home of a cult of cave dwellers who worship the Slipstream and who have recently been under attack by bandits
Byron attempts to help lifting a heavy milling stone off the cult s leader Avatar
Avatar in his dying breaths curses Byron as being part of the out of control technological advancements that lead to Convergence
The cultists decide to let the wind decide what to do with him and tie him to a massive kite
The bounty hunters arrive in the middle of a windstorm and Owens bargains with them to work together to get Byron down
Tasker reveals to Owens that Byron is an android
After a rough landing from the destroyed kite Belitski allows Byron and Owens to get away diving back into the deadly windstorm to search for her partner
Another visitor to the valley Ariel helps Byron and Owens escape the scouring winds and convinces them to give her a lift home
Ariel takes them to her people a group of hedonists who inhabit a fortified underground museum
Byron s knowledge and appreciation of the museum s ancient contents lead to Ariel becoming emotionally attached to him
Byron and Ariel spend the night together in an African Savannah exhibit while Owens gets drunk and hooks up with a local girl
The local girl helps Owen decide to free Byron who has become his friend
Later Byron explains more of his past revealing that the man he killed was his master
Byron also excitedly tells Matt that he has slept for the first time and that he dreamed of a land at the end of the Slipstream inhabited by other androids
Soon after having tracked the trio to the museum Tasker and Belitski force entry killing the guards and some of its inhabitants
After beating the Curator Tasker forces the rest to find the fugitives
Byron is captured and Owens is knocked down
Belitski confronts Owens and shoots him in the chest with a dart Owens retaliates by knocking her out and handcuffing her to a bed
She wakes and tells him that the dart is the antidote to the poison
He sets off after Tasker
A shootout ensues in which Tasker kills Ariel
Enraged Byron pursues Tasker to his plane
Tasker shoots Byron to no effect so he then tries to run Byron down as he takes off but Byron manages to jump on and smash his way into the cockpit
The pair struggle but as Byron is on the verge of killing him Tasker quotes the Magee poem and Byron relents
He then attempts to regain control of the damaged aircraft by using the control wires but he is unsuccessful and it crashes
Tasker is killed but Byron being an android survives
He returns to the museum to find that Belitski and Owens are now a couple
The film ends with Byron leaving to seek his promised land

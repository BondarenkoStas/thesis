Baron von Rhoneberg a former World War II German general sacrificed his daughter as the war ended
This condemned his family to be placed under a terrible curse
Many years later he tells the story to a reporter who wishes to write an article about it and take pictures of his castle
However the Baron is against any photographs
Despite his protests the young woman goes up to visit the castle and take pictures but is killed when a dry thunderstorm suddenly rolls in while she is in close proximity to it
Her body is taken back to the town where it is discovered she has a burn in the shape of a lobster like claw on her arm which is confirmed as the Mark of the Devil
Some time later a group of tourists become lost during a bus trip
They meet Satan in the guise of a man who recommends that they take the ferry boat but they arrive too late to catch the last ferry of the day
They are then directed to an old castle which offers room and board
When they arrive one of the doors opens by itself and a piece of the façade breaks off nearly killing one of the tourists
Hans the butler greets them and shows each of them to their rooms giving them a briefing of the history of two of the rooms one of which bears the same lobster like claw mark on the floor tiles in front of the fireplace
After the guests have been accommodated to their rooms Hans goes down to a laboratory basement and informs the Baron who is practicing alchemy
Over dinner the Baron explains his family s history to his guests
His ancestor made a pact and sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for his services
Satan demanded that the eldest daughter of each generation become a succubus
When asked if he ever had a daughter he shakes his head no
A young woman named Lisa Müller also comes to stay at the castle and proceeds to seduce each tourist according to their own personal weaknesses then kills them using their own sin against them
Each tourist is a representative of one of the Seven Deadly Sins
Matt Ducard represents Gluttony and dies by choking to death while gorging on food and wine
Nancy dies representing Greed by drowning in a hidden treasure hoard of powdered gold
Howard representing Envy and Corrine embodying Lust are murdered while in the middle of an adulterous tryst
Wrathful old Mr Mason is thrown out of a window
Regine dies as Sloth when a snake kills her in her sleep
Only the seminarian Alvin Sorelle as Pride seems immune to Lisa s seductive charms
When six of the seven tourists are dead Satan appears to Alvin
Alvin offers his soul if Satan will return the dead tourists to life to which Satan agrees
The next morning Alvin awakes to find that the dead tourists have indeed been returned to life as though the previous night s events never happened and are having breakfast before they set out to continue their trip
Even Alvin himself remembers it as only a dream
The Baron is wounded that morning in a fencing accident with Hans and Alvin waits with him for an ambulance
The Baron confesses to Alvin that he lied he did have a daughter and killed her in her cradle
After a conversation with Martha the housekeeper Alvin learns that the child the Baron stabbed was not the succubus
Lisa is Martha s daughter from an affair with the Baron s brother Rudolph von Rhoneberg and that Lisa is the eldest daughter
Alvin dismisses Martha s claims that Lisa is subsequently a succubus
Alvin chooses to remain at the castle with Lisa while the other tourists go on
As Alvin and Lisa watch the tour bus heading back to the main road the bus suddenly swerves to miss a funeral wagon driven by Satan and goes over a cliff killing everyone aboard
Alvin enfolds Lisa in his arms
Lisa and Satan smile at each other knowing they have claimed their souls once again

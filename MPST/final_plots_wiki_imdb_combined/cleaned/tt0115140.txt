Cold Lazarus is set in the 24th century in a dystopian Britain where the ruined streets are unsafe and where society is run by American oligarchs in charge of powerful commercial corporations
Experiences are almost all virtual and anything deemed authentic has either been banned or replaced by synthetic substitutes
At a cryonics research institute in London funded by the pharmaceuticals tycoon Martina Masdon a group of scientists led by Dr Emma Porlock is working on reviving the mind of the 20th century writer Daniel Feeld whose head was frozen after Feeld s death at the end of Karaoke
Unable to see any profit in the project Masdon considers discontinuing it but the media mogul David Siltz who has been spying on Masdon envisages making a fortune from broadcasting Feeld s memories on TV and proposes to Porlock that her team work for him
Porlock is unaware that a member of her team Fyodor Glazunov is a member of the resistance group RON which attempts to undermine the reliance of society upon advanced technology by carrying out violent attacks
Glazunov identifies Kaya another of Porlock s team as a potential recruit to his superior Andrew Milton but Milton kills Kaya believing her unsuitable
Angered by Kaya s murder Glazunov kills Milton
Porlock then discovers the truth about Glazunov but to distract him from the possibility of killing her consults with him about the Siltz deal
Glazunov approves of the broadcast of Feeld s memories which he believes might provoke a revolt against the inauthentic life propagated by the authorities
It is shortly after this that Porlock accepts Siltz s offer just as Masdon realises the potential of the Lazarus project
As more of Feeld s thoughts and memories are unearthed it becomes evident not only that Feeld s mind is conscious of its predicament but also that Feeld is attempting to communicate with the scientists and is pleading to be allowed to die
At this point Glazunov Porlock and Luanda Partington begin to doubt the morality of their project
Another of their team Watson having been coerced into informing on his colleagues unwittingly denounces Glazunov as a RON member and saboteur
Having been warned Glazunov heads for the laboratory to put Feeld out of his misery
In the confrontation that ensues Glazunov is able to kill Siltz and after a final communication with Feeld he destroys the laboratory Feeld s head and himself in the process

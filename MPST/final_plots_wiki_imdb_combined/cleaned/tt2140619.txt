The next morning they are less than cordial to each other but Megan can t leave because of a blizzard
Forced to spend more time together the two end up telling each other what they did wrong the previous night convinced that they will never see each other again and Megan suggests that they try again
The two make love again with far better results
Afterwards Megan discovers a closet full of women s clothes and pictures of Alec with a girl
She finds out that Alec s girlfriend Daisy had written a note to him saying that she wanted to break up but hadn t given it to him but he had found it accidentally
Alec wanted to have something to rub in her face when she broke up with him and so he had joined the dating website
Angry Megan leaves

At a New Year s Eve party Megan is arrested because the same note was found in Alec s neighbor s apartment which the two had broken into earlier
Alec arrives to the prison with flowers and balloons
He pays bail but Megan refuses to see him or even leave the holding cell
Later when her roommates come to pay bail Alec apologizes saying that he didn t know her last name and that this was the only way he thought he could see her again
He says that it might be something that the two of them would laugh about years later but Megan is still angry because she had to spend time in jail
She makes him a deal asking for his number and promising to call him the moment she laughed about it
She takes a closer look at the presents he gave her
Minutes later she starts laughing upon seeing the balloon read I m sorry I m an asshole and calls Alec
He meets her outside the police station and they kiss in the middle of the road when it starts snowing again

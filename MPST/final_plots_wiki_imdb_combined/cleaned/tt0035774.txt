A German commander Von Vultur is tempestuously pacing back and forth while fuming and spluttering furiously about how many American commandos have managed to slip into Germany undetected while a snippet from Wagner s Das Rheingold plays on the soundtrack
He gets a telegram from the Gestinko Gestapo threatening him with his ka rear if he lets vun more kommando through
The settings recalls World War I trenches more than any actual scene of World War II
Hearing an American warplane overhead he calls in his servant Schultz whom he abuses by knocking him regularly over his helmet with a mallet
They run outside and use a searchlight to search for any more landing commandos and eventually spot one who just happens to be Daffy floating down on a parachute whilst singing Billy Bennet s She was Poor But She Was Honest in a Cockney accent
After a quick shout of Put out those lights
gets the searchlight turned off temporarily and allows him to land unseen Daffy uses his fingers on the searchlight s lens to make shadows of animated puppets and dancing chorus girls on the clouds to distract the Germans
When Von Vultur chases Daffy behind a curtain that says asbestos Daffy makes a face similar to the stereotypical Japanese faces used in cartoons at the time causing Von Vultur to run off frightened
Back at his bunker Von Vultur is presented with a ticking time bomb from Daffy as a little token of our esteem
Just realizing its imminent danger he hands the bomb off to Schultz who is literally blown through the roof
When Schultz falls back Daffy stops Von Vultur from hitting Schultz over the head with a mallet and instead hits him
Von Vultur chases Daffy to a telephone booth where Daffy continues to make fun of him such as nicknaming him Von Limburger
Daffy then jumps in a plane narrowly avoiding being shot by a whole mess of Messerschmitts
When Daffy is shot down by Von Vultur his plane is literally blown to pieces with Daffy still clinging to the controls
Daffy then runs into what he believes is a tunnel where he can hide but it turns out to be the barrel of a huge howitzer cannon and he s then shot out by Von Vultur
However Daffy flies unharmed into Berlin where Adolf Hitler is making one of his infamous emotionally inflamed furiously ranting public speeches
Daffy jumps up and whacks Hitler on the head with a mallet causing Hitler to yell for Schultz similar to Von Vultur

The long running series featured notable journalists attempting to guess the recent or old news story with which a hidden guest challenger was linked by asking him or her questions in much the same manner as the American game shows What s My Line
and To Tell the Truth
Each round of the game started with news footage that introduced the news story in question to the studio audience and home viewers out of earshot of the panelists
After the guest was identified and or the news story determined the journalists then interviewed the guest about the story or about achievements or experiences for which he or she was known
Unlike American quiz shows that steered clear of controversy in the 1950s and 1960s Front Page Challenge seems to have been affected by just one censorship practice that of avoiding four letter words
Guests came from all walks of life including politicians like Pierre Trudeau and Indira Gandhi activists like Malcolm X sports figures like Gordie Howe entertainers like Boris Karloff and Ed Sullivan and writers like Upton Sinclair
From 1957 to 1979 the show featured many non Canadians whose trips to Canada were paid by the CBC
Occasionally guests were featured for their involvement in stories that had nothing to do with their celebrity status
For example Karloff was featured because he served as a rescue worker following a devastating 1912 tornado in Regina Saskatchewan where he was appearing in a play many years before horror films made him famous
Jayne Mansfield appeared in late 1961 to represent the recent victory of British prime minister Harold Macmillan s Conservative Party in parliamentary elections
The American actress whose high IQ was well publicized was filming a movie in the United Kingdom at the time of the decisive votes
Occasionally the challenger was one of the panelists themselves unbeknownst to the other three panelists
After the game the relevant person simply moved to the guest seat for the interview
The show ran for nearly forty years and featured a remarkably stable cast of panelists including journalist historian Pierre Berton Betty Kennedy Toby Robins and radio commentator Gordon Sinclair
Columnist Allan Fotheringham joined the panel after Sinclair s death
A guest panelist usually another Canadian journalist politician or other celebrity was also part of each episode
In 1990 journalist and radio TV personality Jack Webster joined the show as its permanent fourth panelist
For its initial summer 1957 run the show was hosted by Win Barron best known for his voice over narration of newsreels produced by the Canadian division of Paramount Pictures
However Barron proved ill at ease in the moderator s seat so both Fred Davis and panelist Alex Barris rotated as guest hosts in the early part of the fall before Davis was chosen to take over as host full time though Barris continued to appear as a guest panelist occasionally
In 1981 the CBC published an oversized book written by Barris about the history of the program
It was titled Front Page Challenge The 25th Anniversary
Four years after the show s cancellation another book by Barris was published chronicling the last fifteen years of the show
It included more details and anecdotes about the show s earlier phases not found in his first book
Several weeks after its debut Ottawa Citizen television columnist Bob Blackburn deemed the programme to be noticeably improved and predicted that if that trend continued and if the program doesn t run dry on its slightly limited subject matter Front Page Challenge might well become an institution on Canadian TV
In his book Barris says that at the height of the show s popularity in the late 1950s the individual panelists became major celebrities in Canada
He relates how Toby Robins a beautiful brunette donned a blonde wig for a few episodes as an experiment attracting hate mail including a death threat over the change of appearance
The books also include journalist Barbara Frum s remarks about how influential Robins was for 1950s era female equality through her decision to appear on the program while pregnant
Unfortunately the show s stability proved to be its undoing as the producers did not see fit to add younger panelists while the regulars aged and the audience demographics became less desirable
The show always was videotaped in or aired live from Toronto prior to 1966
During that year four shows originated from Montreal including one with challenger Jessica Mitford
The show continued going on the road being videotaped in cities across Canada
The oldest regular Gordon Sinclair continued travelling with his fellow panelists to videotaping locations until he was well into his 80s
Although the location of the studio was not always noticeable to home viewers they did notice the lack of guest challengers from foreign countries after 1979
The program no longer featured internationally known controversial figures to match the likes of Timothy Leary Indira Gandhi Golda Meir and William F Buckley who had held viewers attention in the 1960s and most of the 1970s
Alex Barris says in his second book that the absence of non Canadian guests after 1979 resulted from budget cuts for CBC Television that ruled out travel expenses
Barris also claims that the advent of multiple cable channels in the 1980s and early 1990s presented another challenge to the staff of Front Page Challenge and contributed to its demise
Prior to the 1980s when there were no 24 hour news channels competing with Front Page Challenge each round of the game began with silent black and white newsreel footage of the news story in question while a narrator not heard by the panelists summarized it
Even after the segments started including colour videotape the only voice heard introducing the topical issue and the challenger was the voice of the narrator of Front Page Challenge
Producers continued to use the same off screen narrator which made the Front Page Challenge footage less appealing to young people than the multiple sound bites featured by CBC Newsworld which began 24 hour newscasts throughout Canada on July 31 1989
CBC Newsworld offered sound bite interviews with people who had witnessed events or were knowledgeable about them
Young viewers using remote controls stuck with the multiple sound bites and ignored the Front Page Challenge narrator s summaries of the news stories according to the book by Alex Barris published in 1999
When Front Page Challenge ceased production in 1995 it was the longest continually running non news program in Canadian television history
Among the contestants on the final show was then emerging country music superstar Shania Twain

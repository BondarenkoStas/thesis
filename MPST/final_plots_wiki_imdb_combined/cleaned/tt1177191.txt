Strait Jacket is set an alternate history where magic was proven to exist in the year 1899
The use of sorcery spread throughout all facets of society and changed the social and technological development of the world
The location is Tristan an urban metropolis that appears to be an amalgamation at the turn of the 20th century Tokyo San Francisco and Victorian era London
Alongside this technology and science exists magic which has been proven possible in public demonstrations by Dr George Greco
Although the use of magic is only possible for a few talented individuals it is very dangerous and highly illegal
Due to an invisible contaminant called the malediction or simply the curse people who use magic too often are at risk in transforming into Demons or horrific malevolent abominations of nature that become immune to ordinary weapons
The Magic Administration Bureau also known as the Sorcery Management Bureau is set up in the attempt to safely explore the nature of magic officially document it attempt to provide rational scientific explanation for it regulate its use and police those who use magic illegally
Magic utilized in a safe sense by the Bureau has been used as a viable energy source by the civil service industry agriculture medicine and the military
Effectively the Magic Administration Bureau is now in control of every field and every facet of society
The primary enemies of the Bureau are Oddman a former left wing terrorist cell turned mercenary
All of these magic users even the ones with innocent and well meaning intentions are in danger of tapping into the dark side either accidentally or on purpose and themselves becoming bloodthirsty beasts due to accidents or sabotage by Oddman s agents
These Sorcerist agents wear a suit of armor that resists the negative transforming effects of magic
These suits are referred to as Mold Armor or more commonly a straitjacket due to the fact they constrain human beings in their natural form
The Sorcerists also use magically tainted bullets from large hand carried railguns powered by a combination of steam and magic which are the only weapons capable of effectively stopping the magically transformed monsters
However the over stretched Bureau is steadily losing ground and increasingly must rely on outside help
There simply aren t enough Sorcerists to fight the Demons caused by Oddmans sabotage
This deliberate sabotage leads to an increase in accidental demonic transformations and attacks on the public across Tristan
Among those who fight the Demons is an unlicensed rogue Sorcerist named Leiot Steinberg who is viewed as a loose cannon bringing the name of Sorcerists into disrepute and causing as much damage as the Demons in his one man war against them
Yet the Bureau is forced to reluctantly call upon his services in their losing battle
Because Steinberg fights against a sin he committed long ago even with his Mold Armor he comes closer and closer to transforming into a Demon every time he casts a spell

Brian Stimpson headmaster of Thomas Tompion Comprehensive School has been elected to chair the annual Headmasters Conference
Extremely disorganised as a young man Stimpson is now obsessively organised and punctual and his school runs like clockwork
He is the first headmaster of a comprehensive school to chair the Headmasters Conference that honour usually being reserved for heads of the more elitist private schools
Despite repetitive rehearsal of his speech and preparations for the journey to the conference his ordered world unwinds as a series of misadventures plague him en route
He misses the train and loses the text of his speech
Stimpson searches for his wife at the hospital but misses her
Along with a sixth form student called Laura he drives to the Conference himself
Stimpson s wife sees him at a petrol station with Laura and is angered that a student is able to attend the Conference but she is not
Stimpson s wife drives after Stimpson and both parties forget to pay for the petrol
The police are called and responding to calls from Laura s parents as well attempt to find Stimpson and arrest him for kidnapping
Stimpson s wife Laura s parents the police and Mr Jolly a teacher at Thomas Tompion who is seeing Laura all desperately head to the conference
En route Stimpson and Laura try to call the Conference by a telephone box
A local mistakes them for vandals when the phones don t work and calls the police
The local sends her daughter to speak to them who turns out to be a childhood friend and former girlfriend of Brian Stimpson
Stimpson coerces her into driving them to the Conference
The group drive into a field and get stuck in the mud whilst Stimpson s wife and the others arrive at the Conference much to the annoyance of the headmasters
Brian goes to find help but ends up having a bath at a nearby monastery
His ex girlfriend drives away in the car but is arrested for assaulting a police officer
Laura and Stimpson attempt to hitchhike
They are picked up by a wealthy car salesman who they persuade to come for a walk in the woods
He and Stimpson swap clothes for fun but Stimpson and Laura soon run away and steal his car
Stimpson finally arrives at the conference in the ripped suit of the car salesman and gives an improvised abrasive speech to the shocked headmasters
During his speech various characters including the old women Mr Jolly and Laura s parents walk into the hall
Finally he directs all of the headmasters to stand and sing the hymn To Be a Pilgrim as he often would to his own pupils
He is then accosted by his disappointed wife Laura s worried parents and several other parties he had hurt over the course of his journey
The film ends as he is led away by several policemen

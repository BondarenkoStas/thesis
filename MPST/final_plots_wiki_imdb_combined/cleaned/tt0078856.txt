The capsized luxury liner S S Poseidon is still afloat after six survivors have been rescued via helicopter
Tugboat captain Mike Turner discovers the shipwreck
Accompanied by second mate Wilbur and passenger Celeste Whitman he heads out to claim salvage rights as the tugboat Jenny lost her cargo in the same tsunami that capsized the Poseidon
They are soon followed by Dr Stefan Svevo and his crew who claim to be Greek Orthodox medics who received the ship s SOS
They board the doomed vessel through the bottom hull opening left by the Greek rescue team and become trapped after the entrance collapses
The group with Turner also encounters the ship s nurse Gina Rowe and two passengers Suzanne Constantine and war veteran Frank Mazzetti who is searching for his missing daughter Theresa whom they soon find along with the elevator operator Larry Simpson and as well as a billionaire named Tex
Later they find the blind Harold Meredith and his wife Hannah who were waiting to be rescued
Water continues to submerge decks and more explosions occur
Turner and his group find the purser s office where Svevo decides he and his men will continue their search for other survivors
Turner agrees and Svevo and his men leave in another direction
Another explosion causes the safe in the purser s office to fall through the bulkhead and open revealing gold coins and cash
Turner and Wilbur excitedly gather it and start looking for another way out of the ship
Unknown to Turner and the survivors Suzanne is actually working with Svevo and takes a list containing information about a cargo of crates from the purser s office
She leaves the group and goes to find Svevo
She gives the document to Svevo but decides she no longer wants to go through with his plan preferring to go back and get out with Turner
Svevo apologizes and orders Doyle one of his men to kill Suzanne
He shoots her but she strikes him with an axe killing him before she dies
While making their way up through the decks Turner and the others find Suzanne s corpse and reach the unpleasant conclusion that a murderer is on board
During one climb towards another deck Hannah dislocates her shoulder while helping her husband
After continuing their progress through the ship Turner and his group find Svevo and his men gathering a cargo of plutonium
Svevo reveals that his real intention for boarding the Poseidon was to retrieve his lost shipment of plutonium adding that he can t let Turner and his group go now
However before they can kill them another explosion occurs allowing them to escape through another cargo room full of cars
Turner Mazzetti and Simpson find some guns and attempt to make a fight of it in the ensuing shoot out Mazzetti and another of Svevo s men are killed
Water floods the deck as Turner s group proceed up to the next deck but an injured Hannah is unable to climb a ladder she falls into the rising water and drowns
While trying to rescue her Turner loses all of his salvaged gold
Svevo and his one remaining gunman head back up to the ship s stern where the rest of Svevo s team attempt to use a crane to raise the plutonium up to the hull of the ship which is still above water but is slowly sinking
In another section of the ship Turner and the survivors exit the ship through an underwater side door but due to shortage of scuba tanks Wilbur sacrifices himself by swimming underwater and disappearing
Turner and Celeste swim to the tugboat Jenny and move it closer to the Poseidon as the remaining survivors swim towards it
Svevo s men see them and open fire killing Tex who willingly holds onto a bottle of champagne as he goes down
Turner s group makes it to his boat and they sail away
Water continues to flood the Poseidon and cause the on board boilers and then the plutonium cargo to explode
Svevo and his men are all killed as the entire Poseidon explodes
On board Turner s boat Turner accepts that his tugboat Jenny will be taken from him when they get to port but Celeste reveals a diamond she salvaged from the Poseidon
Celeste asks Turner Are you going to kiss me now
and Turner replies I was going to kiss you anyway
They kiss and the tugboat Jenny sails away into the sunset with the survivors

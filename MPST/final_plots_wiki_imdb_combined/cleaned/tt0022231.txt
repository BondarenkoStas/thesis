Foxy is a policeman on the beat
He handily subdues a criminal who pops out of a trashcan and sprays bullets with a machine gun
Foxy has his own gun
It shoots out an expandable arm with a platform on the end
A mouse with a mallet stands on the platform and knocks the criminal unconscious Foxy slams the lid back on the trashcan Meanwhile a mouse in his tiny car and a hippo in her oversized automobile are rudely hogging the road and refusing in turns to let each other pass
The hippo gets the better of the mouse but accidentally runs over Foxy
Foxy starts to write the lady out a ticket
Her weeping and her pleading lead him to forgo the ticket and throw a trashcan over her head instead Foxy goes to visit his girlfriend at the nickelodeon
She has a huge dog with a penchant for licking everyone
Foxy s girl plays the piano and Foxy dances
But their musical fun is brief suddenly they hear a machine gun
A tough looking bird in a tiny roadster is chasing and shooting at a hippo in top hat and tails
The bird backs the hippo against a brick wall and steals his pocket watch
The police give chase and Foxy runs after him on foot
The bird drives through a pipe and comes out the other end in a huge car with three tough mugs riding in back
One of the mugs stops Foxy by spitting tobacco juice at him
He stops the police by throwing a grenade which explodes and destroys their cop car turning it into a tandem bicycle
The blackened policemen immediately ride it into the mud Foxy hasn t given up
And he redoubles his efforts when the criminals drive by the nickelodeon and kidnap his girlfriend
Foxy hops on a wooden horse and rides after them
The horse has an expandable neck Foxy extends its head grabs the girl with its teeth and pulls her out of the car
Now Foxy and his girl are pursued by the criminals
Foxy tricks them by riding into the jail
They drive in after him but he his wooden horse and his girl pop out of the manhole in the street
Foxy slams the door on the criminals All seems well but the bad guys have the last laugh
The tough little bird pops out of the manhole and shoots Foxy with his machine gun
Foxy screams Yow

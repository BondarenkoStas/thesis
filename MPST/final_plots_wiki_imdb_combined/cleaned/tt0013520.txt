The tale opens with the third and youngest son of a miller receiving his inheritance a cat
At first the youngest son laments as the eldest brother gains the mill and the middle brother gets the mules
The feline is no ordinary cat however but one who requests and receives a pair of boots
Determined to make his master s fortune the cat bags a rabbit in the forest and presents it to the king as a gift from his master the fictional Marquis of Carabas
The cat continues making gifts of game to the king for several months
One day the king decides to take a drive with his daughter
The cat persuades his master to remove his clothes and enter the river which their carriage passes
The cat disposes of his master s clothing beneath a rock
As the royal coach nears the cat begins calling for help in great distress
When the king stops to investigate the cat tells him that his master the Marquis has been bathing in the river and robbed of his clothing
The king has the young man brought from the river dressed in a splendid suit of clothes and seated in the coach with his daughter who falls in love with him at once
The cat hurries ahead of the coach ordering the country folk along the road to tell the king that the land belongs to the Marquis of Carabas saying that if they do not he will cut them into mincemeat
The cat then happens upon a castle inhabited by an ogre who is capable of transforming himself into a number of creatures
The ogre displays his ability by changing into a lion frightening the cat who then tricks the ogre into changing into a mouse
The cat then pounces upon the mouse and devours it
The king arrives at the castle that formerly belonged to the ogre and impressed with the bogus Marquis and his estate gives the lad the princess in marriage
Thereafter the cat enjoys life as a great lord who runs after mice only for his own amusement
The tale is followed immediately by two morals one stresses the importance of possessing industrie and savoir faire while the other extols the virtues of dress countenance and youth to win the heart of a princess
The Italian translation by Carlo Collodi notes that the tale gives useful advice if you happen to be a cat or a Marquis of Carabas

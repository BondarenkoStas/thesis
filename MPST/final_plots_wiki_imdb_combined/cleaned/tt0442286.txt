The film takes place in Japan in the 1860s a time of cultural assimilation
Two samurai Munezo Katagiri and Samon Shimada bid farewell to their friend Yaichiro Hazama who is to serve in Edo under the shogunate of that region
Though the position is desirable Katagiri voices his concern that a man of Yaichiro s character is likely to run into trouble
His doubts are assured when the married Yaichiro expresses an intention to indulge in Edo s sensual pleasures while stationed there
During dinner that evening Katagiri s mother reminds Samon of the financial hardships the family has endured since the death of her husband
She desires a match between Samon and Shino Katagiri s sister
Also present is Kie the Katagiri s housekeeper who is schooled in etiquette and literacy
In a voiceover Katagiri hints at an affection for Kie but then mentions that around the same time Shino married Samon Kie married a man of the merchant class and left the Katagiri household
Three years go by during which Katagiri s mother passes away
While walking through town he sees Kie in a kimono shop where she assures him that she is well
Weeks later however Shino tells Katagiri that from the start of her marriage Kie has been forced to perform all manner of duties to the point that she is little more than a slave to her new family
Concerned Katagiri visits Mrs Iseya Kie s mother in law and finds her incoherent with illness
Outraged he demands that Kie s husband file divorce papers then carries her to his own house to recover
In the midst of everything the changing times have forced Katagiri and his fellow samurai to learn the art of Western weaponry a thing that the elder members of the clan treat with disdain
Word arrives from Edo that government officials thwarted an uprising against the shogun and that Yaichiro Katagiri s friend was involved
After being brought back to the village in a prisoner s cage Yaichiro is denied the honor of ritual suicide and must live out the remainder of his days in a cell
Believing that Yaichiro s friends are complicit Hori the clan s chief retainer demands that Katagiri identify them but he refuses citing his honor as a samurai and is violently dismissed
Meanwhile Kie has since recovered and is once again Katagiri s housekeeper
Though their fondness for one other is evident both are keenly aware of their difference in social class and act accordingly
Despite this gossip prompts Katagiri to send Kie back to the countryside to live with her father
Shortly after Yaichiro breaks out of prison and takes a family hostage
Hori demands that Katagiri dispatch him
Knowing that Yaichiro is the better swordsman Katagiri visits their former teacher who is now a farmer and learns a dangerous maneuver that involves turning ones back on the enemy
The next day Katagiri arrives on the outskirts of the village and attempts to persuade Yaichiro to surrender
When the latter refuses the two engage in single combat during which Katagiri uses the new technique to deliver a mortal blow
A dying Yaichiro attempts the same but is gunned down by foot soldiers hiding in the woods
Knowing that this is a blatant dishonor to a samurai Katagiri is dismayed
On returning to the village he runs into Yaichiro s wife who reveals that she paid a visit to Hori the night before and exchanged sexual favors for his promise to keep Yaichiro alive
Bound by an oath to commit suicide should Yaichiro die she takes her own life
Unsure of his fealty Katagiri approaches Hori with his treachery to which he crudely admits
Realizing that the Hazamas were victims of a corrupt system Katagiri avenges them both by stabbing Hori in the heart with a thin blade
Katagiri buries the blade at the Hazama s grave as a form of atonement and relinquishes his samurai status
Resolved to become a tradesman he leaves the village for the island of Ezo but not before seeing Kie
With custom no longer a breach Katagiri proposes marriage and Kie accepts
The film ends with them sitting on a hill holding hands pondering a future together

Júlio Madiaga is a probinciano a young rustic from the island of Marinduque who arrives in Manila
From time to time Júlio would pass by the corner of Ongpin and Misericordia as he stares at a peculiar building from a distance
While pursuing his quest he has to work in order to survive the conditions of the urban jungle
At first Júlio lands a job as a construction worker
Not used to such labour he falls unconscious due to fatigue and hunger
In the site he befriends Atong a fellow construction worker who was hired some five weeks before
Another co worker advises Júlio that city life is quite difficult unless one has the income to enjoy urban comforts
Júlio begins to slowly observe the harsh reality of society even witnessing the accidental death of one of the workers
One day while Júlio and Atong are shopping for clothes in the marketplace a fat lady dressed in black and wearing sunglasses catches Júlio s attention
The lady reminds him of Mrs Cruz the woman who brought his childhood sweetheart Ligaya to Manila for schooling
Júlio immediately runs through the crowd to follow the woman and locates her
He tries to approach her but before he could even say anything the lady shrieks in distress
Júlio flees in order to prevent making a scene running back to Atong and leaving the marketplace with him
This was followed by other chance encounters with Mrs Cruz leading him to discover that Ligaya was in fact brought to the capital for prostitution
Ligaya explains everything to Julio upon their reunion
Julio plots with Ligaya of their return to Marinduque
Both agree to meet at Arranque
However Ligaya fails to appear at the appointed time
Júlio returns to the house of a friend Pol who informs him the next day that Ligaya had died in the night having fallen down a flight of stairs during a struggle with Ah Tek the brothel owner
Enraged Júlio stalks Ah Tek who he saw at Ligaya s funeral and successfully dispatches his target
Seeing Julio s crime a mob pursues and eventually corners him the film ends with a slow motion close up of Júlio s terrified face just as his assailants are about to strike

The game starts with a conversation between two men in the port of Rotterdam the Netherlands
They travel to a remote laboratory operated by Dr Ort Meyer finding everyone inside dead
A review of the security footage shows a man in a suit killing several guards and orderlies
Recognizing the man as Agent 47 one of the men decides to hire him
With all evidence of his existence erased 47 decides to leave his life as a contract killer and retreats to a Sicilian church owned by Father Emilio Vittorio taking a job as a humble gardener
One day 47 agrees to attend one of Vittorio s confessions seeking forgiveness
Shortly afterwards a car arrives at the church and Vittorio goes to shoo it away
Instead the occupants abduct him and leave a note demanding a ransom of 500 000
Unable to pay such a large sum 47 contacts the ICA and agrees to perform a contract killing in exchange for information on the whereabouts of Vittorio
He gets information from the Agency that Vittorio has been taken to a cell in the basement of the Villa Borghese a local Mafia hideout
47 infiltrates the Villa Borghese and kills his target but fails to find Vittorio thereafter he steals a car and escapes
To repay his debt to the Agency 47 accepts several contracts in Russia
Upon completing them he negotiates a deal with his employers for both a payment raise and any information on Vittorio
Eventually he gives up his search believing his friend to be dead
Returning to his previous profession he carries out a number of hits in countries such as Russia Japan Afghanistan Malaysia and India
Eventually 47 learns that Vittorio s kidnapping was an elaborate setup by Sergei the brother of one of 47 s five fathers to lure him out of retirement
He also learns that all of his targets were individuals who were involved in the sale of a nuclear warhead to Sergei s gang and that the items he was sometimes ordered to retrieve were the components of two additional nuclear missiles
The warheads possessed key signature software that would disguise them as American made and therefore bypass the American missile defense system
Sergei who intends to sell the missiles needed to eliminate everyone involved in the deal and therefore arranged for 47 to take the contracts
Learning this 47 pursues Sergei who has taken Father Vittorio hostage inside his church
47 kills Sergei and his men and frees Vittorio
Vittorio gives 47 his rosary and begs him to give up his path of violence and death
47 decides that he is incapable of finding inner peace and leaves the rosary on the church door formally returning to the ICA

In rural Oklahoma under the cover of night a marina worker named Tor murders Denise a local waitress by slitting her throat then dumps her body in Lake Tenkiller
The next day a pair of co eds Leslie and Janna head to Janna s summer home near Lake Tenkiller for summer break and to get away from Leslie s abusive fianc√© Josh
At the lake the two get summer jobs at the diner where Denise worked during previous summers
They meet Tor who takes an instant liking to Leslie
Shortly after Leslie and Janna s arrival Tor stabs another waitress Debbie to death in a hot tub
He also knifes and dismembers his lecherous boss Preacher outside of Janna s place after catching him spying on the women
After a while both Leslie and Janna grow to trust and like Tor and offer him to come to their cabin for a beer
By this time the two women have received threatening voicemails on their cabin s phone and assume it s Josh
They pay little mind to it and continue life as usual
Later on Janna goes out to tan on the dock while Leslie is working the closing shift alone at the diner
Tor visits Janna and Leslie s cabin for a beer and murders Janna by stabbing her in the back as she s washing her hair
Meanwhile Josh is looking at maps making phone calls and chain smoking presumably trying to locate Leslie
When Leslie returns home from work she finds Janna s body and believes that it was Josh who killed her
Tor consoles Leslie and soon plays a harmonica and admits that he was the one who killed Janna because he believed that she was a corrupting influence on Leslie
Tor then begins to tell her how much he loves her
Leslie runs off into the wilderness after slashing him across the face with a car key while he professes his love for her
While chasing Leslie Tor hears Josh s car pull up and murders him by slashing his throat leaving his corpse propped up in a room for Leslie to find when she returns to the house
Knocking Leslie out when she finds Josh s body Tor places her in his boat and starts rowing across the lake but is knocked overboard and seemingly drowns when Leslie awakens and swims to shore
Narration by Leslie comments that the police were never able to discern who her attacker really was or where he came from
In the last shot of the film Tor is shown leaping out of the water and the image freezes as the credits roll

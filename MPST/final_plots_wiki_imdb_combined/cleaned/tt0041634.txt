While the innkeeper is serving dinner to the party the townspeople collect to witness the arrival of the coach from Arras
Among them is Lescaut a guardsman who tells his comrades that he plans to meet a kinswoman
The coach appears and among the crowd Lescaut quickly identifies his fragile young cousin Manon who appears to be somewhat confused since this is her first journey one which is taking her to the convent
Manon is accosted by the opportunistic Guillot who tells her that he has a carriage waiting in which they can leave together
His heavy handed seduction is undermined by the return of Lescaut who then lectures the young woman on proper behavior
He leaves her unattended once more and she admires the three fashionably dressed actresses but reproaches herself unconvincingly vowing to rid herself of all worldly visions
Des Grieux traveling home to see his father catches sight of Manon and instantly falls in love
When he approaches she is charmed by his chivalrous address and their exchange rapidly becomes a mutual avowal of love
Both their planned journeys hers to the convent and des Grieux s to his home are swiftly abandoned as they decide to flee together
But there are hints of incompatible aspirations while he returns over and again to tous les deux the phrase she fondly repeats is à Paris

Meanwhile de Brétigny warns Manon that des Grieux is going to be abducted that evening on the orders of his father and offers her his protection and wealth trying to persuade her to move on to a better future
After the two visitors depart Manon appears to vacillate between accepting de Brétigny s offer and warning des Grieux

She hurries off to Saint Sulpice

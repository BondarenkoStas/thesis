In medieval Sweden prosperous Christian Per Töre sends his daughter Karin to take candles to the church
Karin is accompanied by her pregnant servant Ingeri who secretly worships the Norse deity Odin
Along their way through the forest on horseback Ingeri becomes frightened when they come to a stream side mill and the two part and Karin sets out on her own
Ingeri encounters a one eyed man at the stream side mill
When Ingeri asks about his name he enigmatically responds he has none in these days
The man tells Ingeri that he can see and hear things others can not
When the man makes sexual advances towards her and promises her power Ingeri flees in terror
Meanwhile Karin meets three herdsmen two men and a boy and invites them to eat her lunch with her
Eventually the two older men rape and murder Karin while Ingeri watches hidden from a distance
The two older men then leave the scene with Karin s clothing
The younger boy is left with the body and to watch the goats but he takes the situation poorly and quickly becomes sick with guilt
The herders then unknowingly seek shelter at the home of the murdered girl
Her parents discover that the goat herders murdered their daughter when the goat herders offer to sell Karin s clothes to her mother
After they fall asleep the mother locks the trio in the chamber
Ingeri returns to the farm and breaks down in front of Töre
She tells him about the rape and confesses that she secretly wished for Karin s death out of jealousy
In a rage Töre stabs one of the herders to death with a butcher knife before killing the other two with his bare hands
That same day the parents set out to find their daughter s body with the help of Ingeri
Töre vows that although he cannot understand why God would allow such a thing to happen he will build a church at the site of his daughter s death
As her parents lift her head from the ground a spring begins to flow from where she was lying
Ingeri then begins to wash herself with the water and Karin s parents clean their daughter s muddied face

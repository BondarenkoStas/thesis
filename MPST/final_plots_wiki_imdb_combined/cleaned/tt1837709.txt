Following a brief setup scene the play begins with the appearance of two childhood friends Leontes King of Sicilia and Polixenes the King of Bohemia
Polixenes is visiting the kingdom of Sicilia and is enjoying catching up with his old friend
However after nine months Polixenes yearns to return to his own kingdom to tend to affairs and see his son
Leontes desperately attempts to get Polixenes to stay longer but is unsuccessful
Leontes then decides to send his wife Queen Hermione to try to convince Polixenes
Hermione agrees and with three short speeches is successful
Leontes is puzzled as to how Hermione convinced Polixenes so easily and Leontes suddenly goes insane and suspects that his pregnant wife has been having an affair with Polixenes and that the child is a bastard
Leontes orders Camillo a Sicilian Lord to poison Polixenes
Camillo instead warns Polixenes and they both flee to Bohemia
Furious at their escape Leontes now publicly accuses his wife of infidelity and declares that the child she is bearing must be illegitimate
He throws her in prison over the protests of his nobles and sends two of his lords Cleomenes and Dion to the Oracle at Delphos for what he is sure will be confirmation of his suspicions
Meanwhile the queen gives birth to a girl and her loyal friend Paulina takes the baby to the king in the hopes that the sight of the child will soften his heart
He grows angrier however and orders Paulina s husband Lord Antigonus to take the child and abandon it in a desolate place
Cleomenes and Dion return from Delphos with word from the Oracle and find Hermione publicly and humiliatingly put on trial before the king
She asserts her innocence and asks for the word of the Oracle to be read before the court
The Oracle states categorically that Hermione and Polixenes are innocent Camillo an honest man and that Leontes will have no heir until his lost daughter is found
Leontes shuns the news refusing to believe it as the truth
As this news is revealed word comes that Leontes son Mamillius has died of a wasting sickness brought on by the accusations against his mother
Hermione meanwhile falls in a swoon and is carried away by Paulina who subsequently reports the queen s death to her heartbroken and repentant husband
Leontes vows to spend the rest of his days atoning for the loss of his son his abandoned daughter and his queen
Antigonus meanwhile abandons the baby on the coast of Bohemia reporting that Hermione appeared to him in a dream and bade him name the girl Perdita
He leaves a fardel by the baby containing gold and other trinkets which suggest that the baby is of noble blood
A violent storm suddenly appears wrecking the ship on which Antigonus arrived
He wishes to take pity on the child but is chased away in one of Shakespeare s most famous stage directions Exit pursued by a bear
Fortunately Perdita is rescued by a shepherd and his son also known as Clown
Time enters and announces the passage of sixteen years
Camillo now in the service of Polixenes begs the Bohemian king to allow him to return to Sicilia
Polixenes refuses and reports to Camillo that his son Prince Florizel has fallen in love with a lowly shepherd girl Perdita
He suggests to Camillo that to take his mind off thoughts of home they disguise themselves and attend the sheep shearing feast where Florizel and Perdita will be betrothed
At the feast hosted by the Old Shepherd who has prospered thanks to the gold in the fardel the pedlar Autolycus picks the pocket of the Young Shepherd and in various guises entertains the guests with bawdy songs and the trinkets he sells
Disguised Polixenes and Camillo watch as Florizel and Perdita are betrothed
Then tearing off the disguise Polixenes angrily intervenes threatening the Old Shepherd and Perdita with torture and death and ordering his son never to see the shepherd s daughter again
With the aid of Camillo however who longs to see his native land again Florizel and Perdita take ship for Sicilia using the clothes of Autolycus as a disguise
They are joined in their voyage by the Old Shepherd and his son who are directed there by Autolycus
In Sicilia Leontes is still in mourning
Cleomenes and Dion plead with him to end his time of repentance because the kingdom needs an heir
Paulina however convinces the king to continue his penance until she alone finds him a wife
Florizel and Perdita arrive and they are greeted effusively by Leontes
Florizel pretends to be on a diplomatic mission from his father but his cover is blown when Polixenes and Camillo too arrive in Sicilia
The meeting and reconciliation of the kings and princes is reported by gentlemen of the Sicilian court how the Old Shepherd raised Perdita how Antigonus met his end how Leontes was overjoyed at being reunited with his daughter and how he begged Polixenes for forgiveness
The Old Shepherd and Young Shepherd now made gentlemen by the kings meet Autolycus who asks them for their forgiveness for his roguery
Leontes Polixenes Camillo Florizel and Perdita then go to Paulina s house in the country where a statue of Hermione has been recently finished
The sight of his wife s form makes Leontes distraught but then to everyone s amazement the statue shows signs of vitality it is Hermione restored to life
As the play ends Perdita and Florizel are engaged and the whole company celebrates the miracle
Despite this happy ending typical of Shakespeare s comedies and romances the impression of the unjust death of young prince Mamillius lingers to the end being an element of unredeemed tragedy in addition to the years wasted in separation

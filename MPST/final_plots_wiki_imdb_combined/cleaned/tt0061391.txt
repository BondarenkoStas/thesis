Stanley Moon works in a Wimpy s restaurant and is infatuated with the waitress Margaret Spencer
In despair he attempts suicide but is interrupted by the Devil incarnated as George Spiggott

Spiggott is in a game with God trying to be the first to gather 100 billion souls
If he achieves this first he will be readmitted to Heaven
He is also busy with minor acts of vandalism and spite helped by his staff of the seven deadly sins notably Lust and Envy
In return for his soul Spiggott offers Stanley seven wishes
Stanley uses these trying to satisfy his love for Margaret but Spiggott twists his words to frustrate him
Stanley wishes to be more articulate
George turns him into a talkative and pretentious intellectual with a strong Welsh accent
Margaret becomes an equally pretentious character who enthusiastically agrees with all of Stanley s beliefs
Stanley stresses the importance of breaking free from one s social and moral constraints
When Stanley makes his move however she is horrified and starts screaming rape
In this wish Stanley is a multi millionaire and Margaret is his very physical wife but it turns out she is very physical with anyone except him including George
In the third wish Stanley is a rock star
However his fame is short lived and is usurped by a new band whose lead singer speaks flatly about his lack of interest in anyone except himself
Margaret is a vapid and excitable groupie as happy to admire one as the other
Stanley comments that he wishes he was a fly on the wall and George seizes on the opportunity to use up one of Stanley s wishes
They become flies on the wall in a morgue where the inspector is showing Margaret various dead bodies hoping that she will identify one as Stanley
George promises Stanley a wish where he has a quiet life in the countryside with children and Margaret making the anniversary dinner
It soon becomes apparent however that Margaret is actually George s wife
While deeply in love even the attempt to consummate their affection drives both Stanley and Margaret into emotional agony
Stanley attempts to frame a wish that George cannot ruin He wishes that he and Margaret loved one another lived away from the big city and would always be together
However George turns him into a nun of the Order of Saint Beryl or the Leaping Beryllians who glorify their founder by jumping on trampolines
Margaret is also a nun in the order but refuses to consummate their love as they are both women
When Stanley tries to use his seventh wish George reveals he has already used it Before signing the contract George offers him something to prove he is the Devil and Stanley asked for a raspberry ice lolly
Stanley was unaware that this counted as a wish until he is unable to escape his sixth wish
Ultimately Spiggott spares Stanley eternal damnation because he has exceeded his quota of 100 billion and can afford to be generous
Stanley is returned to his old job and life wiser and more clear sighted
Spiggott goes to Heaven to meet God but is rejected again St Peter explains that when he gave Stanley back his soul Spiggott did the right thing but with the wrong motive
In the closing scene Stanley and Margaret are back in the restaurant
Stanley finally asks her out but she says she s already doing something though she does suggest perhaps another night
Stanley smiles happy that he has found the courage to talk to her
Spiggott tries to entice Stanley again but Stanley turns him down
Spiggott leaves and threatens revenge on God by unleashing all the tawdry and shallow technological curses of the modern age All right you great git you ve asked for it

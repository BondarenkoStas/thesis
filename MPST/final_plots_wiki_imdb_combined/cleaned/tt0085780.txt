Within an uninhabited citadel in World War II era Romania lies entrapped a dangerous demonic entity named Radu Molasar
The inner walls of the citadel contain 108 T shaped icons supposedly made of nickel
When the German Army under the command of Capt
Klaus Woermann occupies the castle to control the Dinu Mountain Pass following the commencement of Operation Barbarossa Molasar is unleashed by a pair of looting soldiers who identify one glowing icon as being made of silver
In the ensuing days Molasar kills several soldiers
A detachment of Einsatzkommandos under the command of sadistic SD Sturmbannf√ºhrer Eric Kaempffer then arrives to deal with what is thought to be partisan activity executing villagers as collective punishment
At the instigation of the local priest the Germans retrieve a Jewish historian Prof Theodore Cuza from a concentration camp
He deciphers a mysterious message emblazoned on a wall of the citadel
Molasar saves the professor s daughter Eva from sexual assault by two Einsatzkommandos by feeding on their essence and then enlists the aid of her grateful father to escape
Cuza is also cured of his debilitating scleroderma by the touch of Molasar and therefore becomes doubly indebted to the entity who is taking on a solid form
However a mysterious stranger named Glaeken suddenly arrives to foil this plan
After an unsuccessful attempt by the professor to have the stranger stopped the two supernatural beings confront each other
Molasar who is not perturbed by Christian crosses is weakened and drawn back into the innermost recesses
Glaeken is transfixed taking the place of the seal that was broken by the German looters

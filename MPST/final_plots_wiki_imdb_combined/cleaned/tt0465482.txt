Toni continues working for the Leone family in an effort to display his loyalty and eventually becomes a made man as a result
Toni s mother receives the news and is elated to learn her son s status has finally risen to what she d hoped and eventually calls off the hit she had ordered on Toni previously
The celebration is cut short however as the Liberty City police arrive and arrest Salvatore under suspicion that he is a gang leader known only as Mr Big

Toni soon becomes a respected leader within the Leone family
Salvatore is eventually taken to trial an event which his rivals plan to use as an opportunity to be rid of him
Toni realises this and intervenes keeping Leone safe

Both Salvatore and Toni head to the island where Torini is holding the mayor and a fight ensues resulting in the two killing Torini and using the time with the mayor to establish that O Donovan is now in the Leone family s debt and as the game concludes Salvatore demands that O Donovan grant protection to the Leone family while Toni attempts to unsettle the mayor to ensure it is granted
Afterward it is revealed that Torini was the underboss of Salvatore s uncle who had been trying to undermine his nephew s control of the city

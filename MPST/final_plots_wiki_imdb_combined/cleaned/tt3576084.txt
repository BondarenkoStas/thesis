Zohar and Daffi are returning to Shizaf칩n their middle of nowhere IDF base where they work in Personnel along with Irena why isnt this great actress credited
two ditzes who spend their waking hours singing duets at annoying volume and various other incompetents all commanded by the Nurse Ratched like gung ho drank the IDF Kool Aid Rama With Zohar s aid Daffi who s miserable as Chief Paper Shredder of the unit has composed numerous appeals to headquarters to be transferred to the Kiry치h in Tel Aviv where she fantasizes about lunching at Azrieli Towers except that unbeknownst to Daffi Zohar never sent any of the appeals She doesn t want Daffi to get transferred as it would leave her friendless at Shizaf칩n As the busload of soldiers enters the base a new girl taps Daffi on the shoulder and asks her where Personnel is upon which Daffi promptly decides that her appeals to be transferred have been answered and New Girl is her replacement and Daffi immediately begins training New Girl to take over her job That night Eitan uncredited and his girlfriend are making out in his quarters and there s a knock at the door
He quickly covers up his girlfriend notes of Halfon Hill Doesn t Answer and gets up to answer
It s New Girl who had a fling with Eitan the previous summer and has been obsessed with him ever since
She s not a soldier she borrowed an IDF uniform and entered the base unauthorized notes of Hair in order to see him
When she lunges at him and declares her love Girlfriend emerges from her hiding place devastating New Girl who runs out in tears and proceeds to use a box cutter to remove her tattoo of Eitan s name
The following morning the girls awaken to a pool of blood and a dead New Girl for which Rama blames the entire Personnel team That night Zohar s bed collapses and she refuses to sleep in the only vacant bed that which had been assigned to New Girl
Exasperated Irena moves to the vacant bed and during the night is visited by New Girl s ghost leaving Irena catatonic and non functioning Her imagined replacement dead Daffi decides her only ticket to the Kiryah is by going off to officers training which she completes by the skin of her teeth and gets assigned not to her longed for spot at the Kiryah but to replace Rama at Shizaf칩n on notification of which she bursts into tears Meanwhile lonely and at loose ends without Daffi the girls have begun to taunt Zohar for being a virgin so Zohar decides to rectify her situation
She seduces a reservist and arranges to meet him that night telling Rama that Irena ought to see medical personnel and offering to accompany Irena to the infirmary to which Rama agrees Zohar s date attempts to rape her except just as he s getting ready to enter her a shot is fired by Irena who had followed them and grabbed his gun which he d tossed onto the ground in blatant contravention of strict orders
Aiming his gun at him Irena orders him over to a waste can where she orders him to ejaculate into it Just like what you were about to do to Zohar
He promptly vomits into the waste can upon which Irena throws his clothes and gun at him and orders him to leave the base As a shaky Zohar and a back to normal Irena are returning to their rooms they encounter Rama who asks them what they re doing outdoors
Zohar explains and Irena claims she has no idea what Zohar s talking about
Rama dismisses Irena and punishes Zohar for being AWOL by assigning her the all night task of cleaning and organizing the Personnel office including getting rid of all superfluous paper The following morning Rama comes to inspect the office to find it spotless and every single sheet of paper including all the soldiers files shredded and stuffed into her own office
Rama runs off screaming hysterically realizing her army career is over Meanwhile Daffi arrives to replace Rama and is now commander over her former fellow soldiers who treat her like a joke and don t accept her authority over them
To show Daffi who s boss Zohar prints out multiple copies of all of the transfer appeals she composed for Daffi but never sent and posts them all over the base where they provide entertainment for all at Daffi s expense Daffi decides to avenge the humiliating prank by deleting all the games to which Zohar is addicted and which have served as Zohar s lifeline to sanity
As she s doing so the two get into a staple gun fight and it s discovered by the base IT guy that instead of deleting the games Daffi accidentally deleted all the soldiers files so now there re no records either electronic or paper as the paper files were shredded by Zohar Daffi and Zohar make up while in detention notes of Parent Trap and are treated for their staple wounds in the infirmary where Zohar spends the night with IT Guy with whom we see her snuggling the following morning
The story ends with Zohar getting discharged and alighting from a bus in Tel Aviv with Azrieli Towers on the horizon

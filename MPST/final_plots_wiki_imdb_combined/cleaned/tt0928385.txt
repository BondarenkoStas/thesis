Freedom is about a child Takeru discovering a secret that could change the very society he depends upon
Civilization on the Earth was destroyed by a permanent abnormal climate shift
Cities with millions of people had been built on the far side of the Moon and became the only place where humanity still survived
The remaining population declared the foundation of Republic Eden then set forth expanding those lunar colonies that loved peace and freedom
More than 160 years have passed since then
In Eden children complete their compulsory education program when they are 15 years old
They are then integrated into the society as citizens
During their brief moratorium they are granted freedom
Like other boys Takeru decides to take part in a race with his friends using machines particular to the moon called Vehicle
But what distinguishes Takeru is that he has constructed his own vehicle
When his vehicle catches fire on a public road he is sentenced to 10 hours of volunteer work outside the dome where he discovers the remains of a small crashed capsule bearing photographs and articles seemingly sent from Earth
Structures visible in the background identify the location they were taken as the Kennedy launch facility in Florida
Infatuated with a young woman in the photograph Takeru attempts to research conditions on Earth and finds that the library s information on the home planet is heavily censored
Furthermore nobody is permitted to travel far enough from the dome over the lunar surface to get within visual range
He discovers a small enclave of people living in a facility outside of Eden s centralized control and after befriending the enclave s leader is given access to a moon rover with sufficient range to get a view of Earth
He sees that the Earth is blue it has recovered from the disaster that befell it and is now habitable again
The authorities of Eden pursue Takeru attempting to suppress this discovery but Takeru and his friend Bismarck manage to commandeer an old escape rocket and leave Eden to explore Earth first hand
The escape rocket s capsule comes down slightly off course landing in the ruins of Las Vegas and Takeru and Bismarck use Takeru s vehicle to make the overland trek across the United States

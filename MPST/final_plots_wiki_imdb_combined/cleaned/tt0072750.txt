Agnes White is a waitress at a gay bar living in a run down motel in rural Oklahoma
Unable to move on from the disappearance of her son some years previously she engages in drug and alcohol binges with her lesbian friend R C
Lately she has been plagued by silent telephone calls that she believes are being made by her abusive ex husband Jerry Goss who has recently been released from prison
One night R C
introduces Agnes to Peter Evans a drifter who says he is a recently discharged soldier
Agnes and Peter reach out to each other out of loneliness and start a relationship
He convinces her that he was the subject of biological testing by the U S government while he was in the military and says the anonymous phone calls she has been receiving were made by government agents in anticipation of his arrival
After they have sex Peter tells Agnes that their room has become infested by bugs sent there by the government as part of their experiments
Peter s movements and behavior become more erratic as he fights the bugs invisible to the audience that he claims are infesting his body
Agnes soon joins in this behavior
Over time they isolate themselves from the outside world sealing themselves in their room and covering it with flypaper and aluminum foil and lighting it with the glow from bug zappers
Peter believing that a colony of microscopic bugs was implanted in one of his teeth tears it out of his head
Using a child s microscope he says he sees the bugs in the remains of the crushed tooth as does Agnes
A Dr Sweet arrives and tells Agnes that Peter has escaped while under treatment at a mental institution and that delusions about insects are a known symptom of Peter s mental illness
Peter kills Sweet telling Agnes that he was a robot sent by the government
Together Peter and Agnes elaborate upon Peter s beliefs in a conspiracy including that Agnes son was kidnapped by the government to lead her and Peter to meeting and that each of them is infected with bugs that are meant to mate with one another and take over the world
In order to prevent this Agnes and Peter douse each other in gasoline and set themselves on fire
In the end credits the audience sees shots of the toys in Agnes and Peter s room completely intact with no sign of the aluminium foil and the body of Dr Sweet in the room covered with foil but undamaged by fire
Which shot if any shows reality is left unclear

In Britain in the spring of 1944 Allied forces are preparing for the D Day invasion
Among them are Major John Reisman an OSS officer his commander Regular Army Major General Sam Worden and his former commander Colonel Everett Dasher Breed
The personalities of the three men are shown to clash and the characters of the individualistic Reisman and the domineering Breed are established
Reisman is aided by his friend the mild mannered Major Max Armbruster
Major Reisman is assigned an unusual and top secret mission code named Operation Amnesty
He is to train a small band of the Army s worst convicts and turn them into commandos to be sent on a virtual suicide mission the airborne infiltration and assault on a ch√¢teau near Rennes in Brittany
The chateau will be hosting a meeting of dozens of high ranking German officers the elimination of whom will hamper the German military s ability to respond to D Day by disrupting the chain of command
Those who survive the mission will be pardoned and returned to active duty at their former ranks
However as Reisman repeatedly tells the men few of them will be coming back from this one
After witnessing a hanging in a military prison Reisman is assigned 12 convicts all either serving lengthy sentences or awaiting execution
Sergeant Bowren reads out their sentences of each man as Major Reisman walks down the line of prisoners
On March 19 Reisman visits Franko Wladislaw Maggott Posey and Jefferson in their cells
Some details of their crimes are revealed and he uses a different approach with each in an effort to gain their cooperation
Under the supervision of Reisman and MP Sergeant Bowren the group begins training
After being forced to construct their own living quarters the 12 men are trained in combat by Reisman and gradually learn how to operate as a group
For parachute training they are sent to the base operated by Colonel Breed
Under strict orders to keep their mission secret Reisman s men run afoul of Breed and his troops especially after Pinkley under Reisman s orders poses as a general and inspects Breed s troops
Angered at the usurpation of his authority Breed attempts to discover Reisman s mission by having two of his men attack Wladislaw in the latrine but they are both knocked out by Posey and Jefferson
The 12 men think Reisman sent them until Breed and his men investigate the Dirty Dozen s camp and recognize the two men who jumped Wladislaw in the latrine
Reisman who had been away when Breed and his paratroopers arrived infiltrates his own post and opens fire on the paratroops as the convicts jump them
They disarm the paratroops Colonel Breed is ordered to take his men and leave and Major Reisman is called on the carpet by General Worden and his chief of staff Brigadier General Denton
Denton siding with Breed insists that Reisman has exceeded his authority and urges General Worden to terminate Operation Amnesty
Reisman rises ferociously to the defense of his men pointing out they had crammed six months of training into as many weeks and deserved a chance to prove themselves
Major Armbruster suggests a test that would show whether Reisman s men are ready
During practice maneuvers in which Breed will be taking part the Dirty Dozen will attempt to capture the Colonel s headquarters
During the maneuvers the men use various unorthodox tactics including theft impersonation and rule breaking to infiltrate Breed s headquarters and hold his men and him at gunpoint
This proves to General Worden that Reisman s men can be used for the mission and that the operation is a go
Due to the men s nature Reisman makes them recite the details of the attack in a rhyming chant to help them remember their roles Down to the road block we ve just begun
The guards are through
The Major s men are on a spree
Major and Wladislaw go through the door
Pinkley stays out in the drive
The Major gives the rope a fix
Wladislaw throws the hook to heaven
Jiminez has got a date
The other guys go up the line
Sawyer and Gilpen are in the pen
Posey guards Points Five and Seven
Wladislaw and the Major go down to delve
Franko goes up without being seen
Zero Hour Jimenez cuts the cable Franko cuts the phone
Franko goes in where the others have been
We all come out like it s Halloween
The night of the raid the men are flown to France and practice a rhyme they have learned which details their roles in the operation
A slight snag occurs when upon landing in a tree one of the dozen Jiminez breaks his neck and dies but as trained the others proceed with the mission Gilpin taking on Jiminez s duties
Wladislaw and Reisman infiltrate the meeting disguised as German officers while Jefferson and Maggott sneak onto the top floor of the building
The others set up in various locations around the chateau
The plan falls apart when Maggott sees one of the women who had accompanied the officers abducts her at knifepoint and orders her to scream
The German officers downstairs ignore her thinking she is just having sex
Maggott stabs her and begins shooting wildly at enemy and ally alike alerting the German officers
Jefferson kills Maggott because he has compromised the mission and evidently gone mad
As the officers and their companions retreat to an underground bomb shelter a firefight ensues between the Dirty Dozen and the chateau s guard force
As planned Wladislaw and Reisman lock the Germans in the bomb shelter then pry open the ventilation ducts to the shelter drop unprimed grenades down then pour gasoline inside
Jefferson throws a live grenade down each shaft and sprints for the stolen half track the team has liberated but is shot down as the grenades explode
Over the course of the battle all but two of the convicts are killed leaving Reisman Bowren Wladislaw and Franko as the remaining survivors of the assault team
As they make their escape Franko shouting triumphantly that he has survived is shot by a stray round
Only Reisman Bowren and Wladislaw manage to get out alive
A voiceover from Reisman confirms that General Worden exonerated the surviving members of the Dirty Dozen and communicated to the next of kin of the rest that they died in the line of duty

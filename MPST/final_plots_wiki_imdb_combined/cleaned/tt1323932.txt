Pennsylvania suffers an outbreak of Green Flu a highly contagious pathogen causing extreme aggression mutation to the body cells and loss of higher brain functions
Two weeks after the first infection four immune survivors William Bill Overbeck a Vietnam veteran Zoey a college student Louis an IT analyst and Francis an outlaw biker make their way through the city of Fairfield only to discover that the infection is creating more dangerous mutations
After narrowly avoiding these new infected along with hordes of others the survivors are alerted to the presence of an evacuation point at the nearby Mercy Hospital roof by a passing helicopter
Fighting their way through the city s streets subway and sewers they are rescued from the hospital s roof by the pilot only to discover he is infected
With Zoey forced to kill him the helicopter crash lands in an industrial district outside the city
Finding an armored delivery truck the group uses it to make their way to the town of Riverside
However they find the road blocked and travel the rest of the way on foot
After an encounter with an infected lunatic in the local church they discover that the town is overrun and decide to head to a nearby boathouse for rescue
Contacting a small fishing vessel they manage to reach the city of Newburg on the other side of the river only to find much of it in flames
Seeking cover in a large greenhouse their rest is interrupted when a military C 130 Hercules passes overhead leading the survivors to travel through the city s business district towards Metro International Airport
Upon arrival the group see that in an attempt to contain the infection the military had bombed the airport while infected pilots crash planes in an attempt to land the runway however is largely intact allowing the survivors to fuel up and escape in a waiting C 130
Despite this apparent rescue it crashes as well and the survivors once again find themselves alone on the outskirts of Allegheny National Forest
Following a series of train tracks through the area the group find themselves at a functioning but abandoned military outpost
After answering a radio transmission the survivors make their final stand against hordes of infected before a military APC arrives to transport them to Northeast Safe Zone Echo supposedly the only uninfected area not yet overrun
Instead they are kept at a military installation and informed that even though they are immune they still carry the infection
They are temporarily held by the military before the base is overrun with infected
The four escape via train and travel south at Bill s insistence Bill believes that they can find long term safety from the infected on the islands of the Florida Keys
At the portside town of Rayford they find a boat but must raise an old rusty bridge powered by an aging generator to get the boat into open waters assured that the machinery noise will alert a large horde
However the generator gives out
Bill sacrifices himself in order to restart it so that the others may reach safety
After waiting for the horde to disperse the three then encounter four more survivors
They move the boat to the other side of the bridge and help them re lower the bridge so they can cross in their car
Afterwards Louis Zoey and Francis head back to the boat and set course to the Keys

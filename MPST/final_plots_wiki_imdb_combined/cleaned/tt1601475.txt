Four friends are seen at a high school house party drinking and gossiping in a private room
Their fun is cut short when a pair of identical twins classmates of the friends enter the room with a video camera
The twins force the friends to play Russian roulette the game ending only when all four friends are dead
The next day Detective Lampkin launches an investigation
He interviews classmates of the dead boys and one student named Katie mentions having seen the twins Jonah and Seth Trimble at the party
It is revealed that the twins had once forced Katie to have sex with another boy on camera
Lampkin summons the twins for interrogation but they maintain their innocence
It is also revealed that Lampkin is a haunted man traumatized by his inability to save his beloved wife from a house fire
The twins torture their Headmaster for the name of the person who told Lampkin that they were at the party they eventually force their Headmaster through telepathy to stab himself to death
They then force Katie to kill herself as well and then a pedophile whom they meet at a park
Lampkin deduces that the twins possess telepathic powers and in his search for a cause he learns that their mother had submitted herself to experimentation at a fertility clinic in order to get pregnant with the twins
Meanwhile Jonah falls in love with another student named Eve
As Jonah grows closer to Eve he pulls away from Seth finally telling Seth that he wants nothing more to do with the mysterious project that they have been conducting
In anger Seth impersonates Jonah and has sex with Eve to prove that Eve cannot tell them apart and therefore must not really be in love with Jonah
The twins brawl at school
Jonah goes home only to be confronted by Lampkin
Seth returns home shortly after and it is suddenly revealed that their parents are disfigured and their house is in ruins as children the twins forced their parents who had become suspicious of the twins to stab each other in the face
Although he had been compliant until now in their charades Jonah decides that he no longer wants to force people to hurt themselves
After knocking out Lampkin Seth attacks Jonah and sets the house on fire
Eve shows up to the house and tries to intervene by shooting Seth in the leg
She flees upstairs but Seth follows and chokes her
Jonah rescues Eve as Jonah and Seth struggle the burning floor gives way and the twins fall through onto the dining room table
Lampkin wakes up and saves Eve from the fire although he dies from his burns it is insinuated that Lampkin has redeemed himself for the death of his wife
The twins lie paralyzed on the dining room table as the house burns around them
Understanding that they will die the twins finally experience fear for the first time the ultimate goal of their project

Astronauts Taylor Landon Dodge and Stewart are in deep hibernation when their spaceship crashes in a lake on an unknown planet after a long near light speed voyage during which due to time dilation the crew ages only 18 months
As the ship sinks Taylor finds Stewart dead and her body desiccated
They throw an inflatable raft from the ship and climb down into it before departing the ship Taylor notes that the date is November 25 3978 approximately two millennia after their departure in 1972
Once ashore Dodge performs a soil test and pronounces the soil incapable of sustaining life
After abandoning their raft the astronauts set off through a desolate wasteland in hopes of finding food and water before their provisions run out
Eventually they encounter plant life
They find an oasis at the edge of the desert and go swimming ignoring eerie scarecrow like figures around the edge of the water
While they are swimming their clothes are stolen
Pursuing the thieves the astronauts find their clothes torn to shreds their supplies pillaged and the perpetrators a group of humans that are apparently so primitive that they cannot even talk and dressed in torn clothes raiding a cornfield
Taylor is attracted to one of the humans whom he later names Nova
Suddenly armed and uniformed gorillas on horseback charge through the cornfield brandishing firearms snares and nets
They capture some humans and kill the rest
In the chaos Dodge is shot in the back of the neck and killed Landon is wounded and rendered unconscious and Taylor is shot in the throat and taken prisoner
The gorillas take Taylor to Ape City where his life is saved after a blood transfusion administered by two chimpanzees animal psychologist Zira and surgeon Galen
While his throat wound is healing he is unable to speak
Taylor discovers that the various apes who can talk and are in control are in a strict caste system gorillas are police officers military hunters and workers orangutans are administrators politicians lawyers and priests and chimpanzees are intellectuals and scientists
The apes have developed a primitive society based on the beginnings of the human Industrial Era
They ride horses and have carts rifles and even primitive photography
Humans who are believed by the apes to be unable to talk are considered vermin and are hunted either killed outright enslaved or used in scientific experiments
Zira and her fianc√© Cornelius an archaeologist take an interest in Taylor whom Zira calls Bright Eyes
Taylor attempts to communicate by writing in the dirt but Nova who has been following him around attempts to destroy his writing with her hands not understanding what the words mean
The letters she doesn t destroy are then obliterated by Zira s and Cornelius s superior an orangutan named Dr Zaius
Back in his cage Taylor steals Zira s pencil and notebook and uses them to write the message My name is Taylor
Zira and Cornelius become convinced that Taylor is intelligent but upon learning of this Dr Zaius orders that Taylor be castrated
Before the castration can occur Taylor escapes and during his desperate flight through Ape City passes through a museum where he finds Dodge s stuffed and eyeless corpse on display
When Taylor is recaptured by gorillas he overcomes his throat injury and roars Take your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape
A tribunal to determine Taylor s origins is convened by the president of the Assembly Dr Zaius and Maximus
Dr Honorious is the prosecutor
Taylor mentions his two comrades at this time
The court then produces Landon who has been subjected to a lobotomy that has rendered him catatonic and unable to speak
After the tribunal Dr Zaius privately threatens to castrate and lobotomize Taylor if he does not tell the truth about where he came from
With help from Zira s socially rebellious nephew Lucius Zira and Cornelius free Taylor and Nova and take them to the Forbidden Zone a taboo region outside Ape City that has been ruled out of bounds for centuries by Ape Law
A year earlier Cornelius led an expedition into the Forbidden Zone that found a cave containing artifacts of an earlier non simian civilization
The group sets out for the cave to answer questions Taylor has about the evolution of the ape world and to prove he is not of that world
Arriving at the cave Cornelius is intercepted by Dr Zaius and his soldiers
Taylor holds them off threatening to shoot them if he has to
Zaius agrees to enter the cave to disprove their theories and to avoid physical harm to Cornelius and Zira
Inside Cornelius displays the remnants of a technologically advanced human society pre dating simian history
Taylor identifies artifacts such as dentures eyeglasses a heart valve and to the apes astonishment a talking children s doll
More soldiers appear and Lucius is overpowered but Taylor again fends them off
Dr Zaius is held hostage so Taylor can escape but he admits to Taylor that he has always known that a human civilization existed long before apes ruled the planet and that the Forbidden Zone was once a paradise your breed made a desert of it ages ago
Taylor nonetheless thinks it best to search for answers but Dr Zaius warns him that he may not like what he finds
Once Taylor and Nova have ridden off Dr Zaius has the gorillas lay explosives to seal off the cave and destroy the remaining evidence of the human society
He then has Zira Cornelius and Lucius charged with heresy
Taylor and Nova at last free follow the shoreline and discover the beach covered remains of the Statue of Liberty revealing that this alien planet is actually Earth long after a nuclear war
Realizing what Dr Zaius meant earlier Taylor falls to his knees in despair and anger and condemns humanity for destroying the world

After a swarm of leaf gobblers devours all of the plants in the Great Valley and reduces it to a barren wasteland the inhabitants leave to find another place where they can survive until the plants in the Great Valley have regrown
However the leaf gobblers have left a path of devastation behind them leaving no food for the dinosaurs to find
After searching for many days tension enters the group as Cera s father and Littlefoot s grandfather argue over changing their course which starts a fight between Littlefoot and Cera
The fight soon breaks up when Cera s father declares that each herd should go its own way the next morning
Not wishing to be separated Littlefoot leads his friends away from the adults during the night intending to find food before they are found missing
They leave a trail for the grownups to follow and eventually reach the Big Water
Although they are disgusted by the saltwater they see a verdant island connected to the mainland by a thin land bridge
On their way an earthshake occurs causing it a tsunami that they narrowly escape
They quickly tuck into the plentiful bounty of the island but are then horrified to discover the tsunami has destroyed the land bridge
Isolated on the island they try out Cera s idea to return to the mainland by using a log as a boat
The plan initially works well despite Cera suffering seasickness and Petrie being too terrified of the Big Water to act as lookout
However a Cretoxyrhina attacks and in the confusion and fright that follows they end up on the island again
That night they remember their families while the herd who discovered the children were missing and followed the trail sleep on the beach on the mainland worrying for their safety
The next morning the children wake up to the shadow of a Sharptooth
They take off but find themselves cornered by high cliffs
They huddle together when the Sharptooth approaches only to find that it is Chomper a young Sharptooth who hatched in their care before returning to his parents and who has learned how to talk like the children
Chomper hides the children from his parents in foul smelling plants and provides them with leaves upon their request
However an overcautious Cera openly distrusts Chomper because he is a Sharptooth which saddens him and he departs
Littlefoot follows him and apologizes but is interrupted by Chomper s mother
Littlefoot watches as she nuzzles Chomper then leaves and is intrigued by her display of love to Chomper
Meanwhile a Giganotosaurus living on the island finds and chases the children
Chomper and his parents intervene and they battle the Sharptooth near the edge of the island
The Sharptooth eventually falls into the Big Water and takes Chomper with him much to his parents shock
Littlefoot dives in to save Chomper while the Sharptooth is swept away by the current
An Elasmosaurus named Elsie appears saving Littlefoot and Chomper from drowning
She returns them to the island where Chomper s parents promise never to harm the children
Cera realizes and accepts that not all Sharpteeth are so bad and monstrous as she thought
Elsie offers to take them across the sea so Chomper and his parents bid them farewell promising to see them again
When back on the mainland the children find that the herd found a lush green little sanctuary on the shore to stay in until the Great Valley becomes fertile again

Lily Bart a beautiful but impoverished socialite is on her way to a house party at Bellomont the country home of her best friend Judy Trenor
Her pressing task is to find a husband with the requisite wealth and status to maintain her place in New York society
Judy has arranged for her to meet the wealthy though boring Percy Gryce a potential suitor
Lily grew up surrounded by elegance and luxury an atmosphere she cannot live without as she has learned to abhor dinginess
The loss of her father s wealth and the death of her parents left her an orphan without inheritance or a caring protector
She adapts to life as ward of her straight laced aunt Julia Peniston from whom she receives an erratic allowance a fashionable address and good food but little succor
Additional challenges to her success in the marriage market are her advancing age she has been on the marriage market for ten years her penchant for gambling at bridge leaving her with debts beyond her means to pay her efforts to keep up with her wealthy friends her inner most desire to marry for love as well as money and status and her longing to be free of the claustrophobic constrictions and routines of upper crust society
Lily s week at Bellomont ends up in a series of failures beginning with losing a large sum at bridge
She also loses her ploy to marry Percy Gryce even though her relationship with him during the week goes so well everyone thinks an engagement between them is imminent
There are threats to her reputation because of her risky decision to visit her friend Lawrence Selden s Manhattan flat during the two hour wait for the train to Bellomont
On departing she unfortunately encounters Mr Rosedale a Jewish businessman known to her set
Attempting to cover the appearance of an indiscretion she professes to have been consulting her dress maker
On her last day at Bellomont threats to Lilly s social standing begin when she agrees to have Gus Trenor make investments for her with the small amount of money she has
Lacking financial knowledge Lily truly believes Gus is making investments on her behalf and accepts several large checks from him
On several occasions however Gus makes it clear that he expects romantic attention from Lily in exchange for his financial expertise
She begins playing cat and mouse with him resulting in her public appearances at opera and late afternoon walks in Central Park with him
In retribution for a social snub Lily s cousin Grace Stepney informs their aunt Julia about rumors that Lily has gambling debts which she may be trying to cover through an inappropriate relationship with Gus Trenor
This sows seeds of doubt and discomfort in Aunt Julia who though shocked does not discuss the situation with her niece so as to avoid a scene
Lily s failure with Percy Gryce occurs when at week s end the tall handsome and engaging Lawrence Selden unexpectedly shows up at Bellomont
Lily chooses to spend Sunday afternoon with him instead of meeting Percy for morning church services and an afternoon walk
Even though she made it clear to Selden during their tête à tête in his flat that she looked at him as that friend who won t be afraid to say disagreeable things to her she becomes drawn to him romantically
Succumbing to her agreeable femininity Selden begins to fall in love with Lily yet realizes that she cannot marry a man of his modest means
Her strategy to marry Percy Gryce is thwarted by Bertha Dorset who is still wildly interested in Selden with whom she has been carrying on an extramarital affair
When she realizes that Selden came to Bellomont to see Lily Bertha retaliates by making sure Percy finds out about Lily s gambling smoking and borrowing money from men to pay off her gambling debts
Percy gets scared off and soon thereafter marries Evie Van Osburgh
Mrs Dorset s public pride in her match making victory makes Lily subject to social ridicule
Lily decides not to burn Bertha s love letters to Selden which she purchased from the char woman at Selden s apartment house who mistook Lily for Selden s paramour
Lily attempts to neutralize the deleterious effects of the gossip surrounding her by renewing her association with her nemesis Bertha Dorset attending an unsuccessful house party at Bellomont and cooperating with Carrie Fisher s mission to bring the newcomers the Wellington Brys into high society
Following Mrs Fisher s advice the Wellington Brys throw a large general entertainment featuring a series of tableaux vivants portrayed by a dozen fashionable women in their set including Miss Bart
The pièce de résistance of this highly successful event turned out to be the portrayal of Mrs Lloyd in Sir Joshua Reynolds famous 18th century painting
The portrait shows an attractive woman suggestively clad
As the curtain opens on this last scene the gasp of approval heard from the audience was not as much for Reynold s brilliant interpretation of Mrs Lloyd as it was for the loveliness of Lily Bart herself marking the pinnacle of her social success
As Selden observes her in this tableau elegant in its simplicity it is as if for the first time he sees the real Lily Bart and feels the desire to be with her
He finds her alone in the ballroom toward the end of the musical interlude as the collective praise from her admirers was subsiding
He leads her to a garden where he tells her he loves her and they kiss
Lily sighs Ah love me love me but don t tell me so
and takes her leave
As Selden gathers his coat to leave he is disturbed by Ned Van Alstyne s remarks


Gad what a show of good looking women but not one of em could touch that little cousin of mine



I never knew till tonight what an outline Lily has The next day Lily receives two notes one from Judy Trenor inviting her to dine that evening at her town house and the other from Selden asking to meet with her the following day
Though she had a dinner engagement she agreed to a visit with Judy at ten o clock
However her late evening encounter turns out to be with Gus alone
Gus vehemently demands the kind of attention he thought he had paid for
Pleading naivité about business matters and appealing to their friendship she promises to pay back the almost 10 000 she owes him
With heightened anger and resentment he accuses Lily of playing with him while entertaining other men
Lily gets him to back off and gets herself into a hansom cab
Shaken and feeling very much alone she calls on her friend Gerty Farish for succor and shelter for the rest of the evening
The following day Lily pleads with her aunt to help her with her debts and confesses that she has lost money gambling at bridge even on Sundays
her Aunt Julia refuses to help her except to cover the 1 000 to 2 000 bill for clothes and accessories
Feeling trapped and disgraced she turns to thoughts of Selden and his love as her savior and has a change of heart towards him as she looks forward to his visit at four o clock
Instead her visitor turns out to be Simon Rosedale who so smitten by her appearance in the tableau vivant proposes a marriage that would be mutually beneficial
Considering what Rosedale knows about her she skillfully pleads for time to consider his offer Selden does not appear for his 4 00 appointment nor does he send word in explanation
Instead he has departed for Havana and then on to Europe on business
To escape the rumors arising from the gossip caused by her financial dealings with Gus Trenor and also disappointed by what she interprets as Selden s emotional withdrawal Lily accepts Bertha Dorset s spur of the moment invitation to join her and George on a Mediterranean cruise aboard their yacht the Sabrina
Bertha intends for Lily to keep George distracted while Bertha carries on an affair with young Ned Silverton
Lily s decision to join the Dorsets on this cruise proves to be her social undoing
In order to divert the attention and suspicion of their social circle away from her Bertha insinuates that Lily is carrying on a romantic and sexual liaison with George by commanding that she not return to the yacht in front of their friends at the close of a dinner the Bry s held for the Duchess in Monte Carlo
Selden helps her arrange for lodging for the night with her cousin Jack Stepney under the promise that she leave promptly in the morning The ensuing social scandal ruins Lily s reputation and almost immediately causes her friends to abandon her and Aunt Julia to disinherit her
Undeterred by such misfortunes Lily fights to regain her place in high society by befriending Mr and Mrs Gormer and becoming their social secretary so as to introduce the Gormers to high society and groom them to take a better social position
However her enemy the malicious Bertha Dorset gradually communicates to them the scandalous personal background of Lily Bart and so undermines the friendship which Lily had hoped would socially rehabilitate her
Only two friends remain for Lily Gerty Farish and Carry Fisher who help her cope with the social ignominy of a degraded social status whilst continually advising Lily to marry as soon as reasonably possible
Despite the efforts and advice of Gerty and Carry to help her overcome notoriety Lily descends through the social strata of the high society of New York City
She obtains a job as personal secretary of Mrs Hatch who is a disreputable woman and who very nearly succeeds in marrying a wealthy young man in Lily s former social circle
She resigns after Lawrence Selden returns to warn her of the danger but not in time to avoid being blamed for the crisis
Lily then finds a job in a milliner s shop yet unaccustomed to the rigors of working class manual labour her rate of production is low and the quality of her workmanship is poor and she is fired at the end of the New York social season when the demand for fashionable hats has ceased
Meanwhile Simon Rosedale a Jewish suitor who earlier had proposed marriage to Lily when she was higher in the social scale returns to her life and tries to rescue her but Lily is unwilling to meet his terms
Simon wants Lily to use love letters which she bought from her servant to confirm the occurrence of the love affair between Lawrence Selden and Bertha Dorset
For the sake of Selden s reputation Lily does not act upon Rosedale s request and secretly burns the love letters when she visits Selden one last time
Eventually Lily Bart receives a ten thousand dollar inheritance from her Aunt Peniston with which she repays Gus Trenor
Distraught by her misfortunes Lily had begun regularly using a sleeping draught of chloral hydrate to escape the pain of poverty and social ostracism
One day Lily takes an overdose of the sleeping draught and kills herself
Hours later Lawrence Selden arrives to her quarters to finally propose marriage but finds Lily Bart dead only then is he able to be close to her

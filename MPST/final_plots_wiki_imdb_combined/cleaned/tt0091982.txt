The policeman Stan Jalard and his colleague Simon Lecache are rather fed up with police work
They are toying with the idea to quit police service in order to run a hotel on the Antilles
Single father Lecache has already asked his son Christian about it
But at the very evening when Lecache tells Jalard that his son approves of their plan Lecache is murdered by the professional killer Charly Schneider
Jalard changes his mind
He dedicates his life all the more to police work
After two more years he has been promoted but he had no chance to get Schneider yet because Schneider disappeared
Eventually Schneider returns to France and commits crimes
Moreover he threatens Jalard on the phone and later devastates his flat
He even sends somebody to shoot Jalard and his godson Christian in the street
Jalard identifies Schneider s new accomplices and puts them under pressure
Step by step he closes in on him until he can confront him in his hide out
Schneider refuses to show any regret eludes and steals a car
He tries to run over Jalard who arrests him anyway
Now that Jalard has brought the murderer of Christian s father to justice he allows Christian to call him Dad
He who has put his godson away into boarding schools all the time and lived only for his police work now demonstrates a shift in priorities
When they drive home Jalard puts a police siren on top of his car and drives wiggly lines just because that obviously amuses little Christian a lot

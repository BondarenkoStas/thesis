NOTE Sequel to El Vampiro Doctor Mendoza Carlos Ancira has heard so much about the vampire encountered by his colleague Doctor Enrique Zaldívar Abel Salazar at Marta González s Ariadna Welter hacienda that he and his henchman ex con Barraza Yeire Beirute went back to Sierra Negra and found the coffin
Mendoza knows that the corpse is that of a vampire because it has no reflection in a mirror or rather the flesh has no reflection
Although Count Lavud s Germán Robles body looks as fresh to the eye as the day he was destroyed all that reflects in a mirror is his skeleton
Consequently Mendoza is bringing the corpse to Louis Pasteur Hospital in order to conduct experiments on it and find out how much of the vampire legend is true
Are vampires really sensitive to the sun
Do they really need to drink blood
Can they really turn into bats
Are they really immortal On the other hand Enrique adheres to his original belief that Duval is simply a normal person with a liking for blood
Enrique s almost convinced Marta of the same
He s been treating her and is in fact planning to release her from the hospital tomorrow so that she can go back to the Teatro where she works as a dancer
That is until Mendoza brings Duval s corpse to the hospital
At first Enrique is outraged that his colleague would engage in grave robbing but he eventually agrees to help on the condition that they burn the body at the end of the experiments
When they leave the room in order to get the instruments for dissection however Barraza climbs in the window opens the coffin and attempts to remove an ornate brooch from around Duval s neck
In doing so he dislodges the stake Lavud revives makes a renfield out of Barraza and escapes Marta s aunt María Teresa Alicia Montoya who witnessed Mendoza and Barraza carting away the coffin and tried to stop them comes to the hospital to warn Enrique that Duval s body has been stolen
When she hears that the coffin is actually at that very hospital she especially fears for Marta because Marta has already been bitten once by Duval
If she s bitten again she will turn into a vampire so the three of them Enrique María Teresa and Mendoza comb the hospital for Lavud
It is too late however for Lavud has been wandering the halls and come upon a little girl lying asleep in her hosital bed
As he bends over to bite her neck she awakens and screams
Lavud runs to another room and is surprised to see Marta standing before him
Lavud sees fate knocking and hypnotizes her to obey his will
By the time Enrique comes to her room Marta is passed out on the floor and Lavud has disappeared Meanwhile at the Museo de Cera a tour group is being introduced to the wax figures of murderers and instruments of execution such as the gallows the guillotine
and the Virgin of Nuremberg an iron maiden fitten with eight inch spears embedded in the door
After the tour is over and the group has left the guide is surprised to see his old cellmate Barraza standing among the wax figures
Barraza needs a place to stay and the basement of the Museo will do just fine thank you or else
Shortly thereafter María Teresa and Mendoza come knocking on the Museo door looking for Lavud s corpse
While Barraza and Mendoza search among the figures María Teresa makes her way down into the basement where she finds Lavud s coffin
Unfortunately Lavud has been following them too
When María Teresa finds the coffin and calls to Mendoza for help Lavud strangles Mendoza
María Teresa attempts to hide in the iron maiden but Barraza sees her shawl hanging out and closes the door on her killing her instantly Meanwhile back at the hospital Enrique has been trying to explain to the director about the vampire but he is not believed particularly now that the body the coffin and Dr Mendoza have all disappeared
Concerned for Marta s safety Enrique makes her sit up with him drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes waiting for dawn
Marta reveals that she saw Duval in her room earlier that evening and wants to know what is going on
As Enrique explains about Mendoza bringing the vampire s body to the hospital neither of them realizes that Duval is standing outside the door mentally calling to Marta
Fortunately Enrique intercepts her as she tries to leave the room
Thwarted and with dawn almost upon him Duval returns to his coffin in the basement of the Museo In the morning Marta is released from the hospital and returns to the theater with Enrique in tow
That evening Lavud locates the theater where Marta is rehearsing and has a bite to drink from the cafe across the street
Enrique is summoned to tend to Lavud s dinner and recognizes the telltale bites on her neck
When he tells the police that the girl died from a vampire s bite they don t believe him
Meanwhile rehearsal has ended and Marta is primping in her dressing room
Suddenly Lavud appears
He removes the brooch from his neck and swings it in front of Marta s eyes placing her in a trance then places the brooch on her neck just as Enrique returns
When Enrique sees the brooch on Marta s neck he realizes that the time has come for them to confront Duval
Marta has no idea how but Enrique has a plan
As he explains it to her telling her that she must not exchange the brooch for a crucifix they do not realize that Duval is listening But first the show must go on
While Marta dances Enrique searches the theater for signs of Duval
Following a jungle dance Marta is lifted off the stage by a swing made of vines
When she nears the top of the scaffolding Barraza is waiting for her
Marta fights him off but a raise of Duval s hand places her in trance
As Duval carries Marta down many flights of metal stairs to where the Teatro links with the Museo Barraza knocks out Enrique and follows his master but Enrique recovers quickly and pursues
Duval carries Marta down into the Museo basement where he lays her on top his coffin
He lights some candles and places a ring on Marta s hand in preparation for making her his bride as Enrique and Barraza play cat and mouse upstairs among the wax figures
In their struggle Barraza attempts to trap Enrique in the iron maiden but he escapes In the basement Duval is about to bite Marta for the second time when she suddenly comes out of the trance screams and races up the stairs and out into the Museo proper
Enrique pounces on Duval and accidentally pushes Marta onto the rack of the guillotine her neck fitting nicely in the slicer
Duval uses all his vampire tricks such as disappearing and changing into a bat but Enrique finally gets him by throwing a spear which impales the bat against the wall where he turns back into Duval
Marta comes out of her trance and sits up just in time
She has no sooner lifted her head from the guillotine when the blade falls The police come barreling down the stairs and catch Barraza but it s all over except for the final kiss

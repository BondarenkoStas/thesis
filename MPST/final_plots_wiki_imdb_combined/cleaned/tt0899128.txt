Shanks treats Marnie quite badly telling her she will remain in the house until her sentence is up
He tells her to clean up some blood from the wall and that she will have lots of time to think about what she did
Marnie argues with him telling him that if the police had taken her crime reports seriously her husband would still be alive today
The cynical Shanks leaves with indifference Later that day Marnie takes all of her husband s pictures and belongings and puts them in her basement where the detector goes off
She then paints over the blood in the wall
She calls the power company about having her power restored and they tell her they can t make it until Monday so she has to light some candles

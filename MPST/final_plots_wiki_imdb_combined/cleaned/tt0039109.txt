As the story opens strange operatic vocals are soon heard far out at sea
Some sailors soon report something that leaves many flabbergasted the vocals are emitting from a whale The public and a number of notable people are split some refuse to believe while others accept the miraculous story The story soon reaches the desk of opera Impresario Professor Tetti Tatti
After thinking long and hard the Professor can only come to one logical conclusion the whale has swallowed an opera singer The Professor charters a crew and publicizes his quest
A lone seagull named Whitey just happens to see a newspaper article telling of Tetti Tatti s search and takes it out to sea to show his friend Willie
Willie hasn t actually swallowed an opera singer but can really sing
When the seagull shows Willie the newspaper Willie assumes that the Professor is looking to audition him and given Tetti Tatti s credentials Willie feels his dream of singing at the Metropolitan Opera may finally come true Willie soon comes upon the Professor s boat and begins to sing music from The Marriage of Figaro
Tetti Tatti demands that his crew harpoon the whale but the crew soon grows enamored by Willie s vocals and applaud for more Willie soon proves to be a singing miracle when he begins singing in 3 part harmony able to sing in Tenor Baritone and Bass
The crew is impressed but Tetti Tatti now believes that this whale has swallowed 3 opera singers Willie continues to sing as the audience is drawn into his imagination as he imagines himself on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera singing numerous other arias However Tetti Tatti soon breaks free from the crew and harpoons Willie killing him In the closing narration we see Whitey the seagull who was Willie s friend dejected over the loss
But the narrator explains that the audience should not feel anger towards Tetti Tatti and that some people just aren t used to miracles The narrator closes by explaining that somewhere in heaven above Willie still sings but in 1 000 voices
The closing image shows Willie in angelic garb singing in a choral tone before we see the gates of heaven showing that the performance is sold out to see Willie perform

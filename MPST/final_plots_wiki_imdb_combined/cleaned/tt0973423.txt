Three hundred and fifty years have passed since humans first settled the Balkan star system located approximately 150 light years from Earth where a number of planets have been terraformed to resemble Earth
Two 11 year old twins Thor and Rai live on the space colony Juno until they come home to find their parents have been murdered
The unknown assassins drop Thor and Rai on Chimaera a secret planet used as a penal colony
Thor learns about Chimaeran society s four Rings and how to leave Chimaera by becoming the Beast King from Zagi who rescued Thor and Rai after they immediately run into trouble on the planet
Thor proceeds to the Ochre Ring where he gets swept up into that Ring s politics and winds up defeating its Top bringing him closer to becoming the Beast King
After several years Thor faces off with Zagi who has violently taken over the Blanc ring and is determined to rule over and change Chimaeran society
Their encounter ends with an uneasy truce and a plan to force Juno to negotiate with Thor
When Thor finally meets Odin the President of Juno the mystery of Thor s and Chimaera s secret origins are revealed
Odin tells Thor he is a genetically engineered human created from the DNA of all the previous Beast Kings
His mother Eve was the lead researcher at the facility where he was created and was a surrogate mother to him
Thor s genes adapt to survive under any circumstances so they mimicked Eve s physical appearance
This is the reason Thor appeared to be Rai s twin
Odin also reveals no new children are being born in the colonies and that Thor is humanity s last hope for survival
Finally Odin reveals a long kept secret that Earth was destroyed by an asteroid collision long ago and humanity cannot return there so they must adapt to survive in the Balkan Star System
However Odin s plans involve dissecting Thor in order to mass produce more genetically engineered humans capable of surviving in Balkan and terraforming Chimaera which would kill the planet s current inhabitants
With the help of Third Thor stops the terraforming process though Third dies in the process
Thor returns to Chimaera to live with Chen Zagi and the rest of the planet s inhabitants
In the end it is revealed that Thor s genes have adapted once again causing him to take on Third s physical appearance
He and Chen appear to be together
He adopts an orphan girl they both found naming her Tiz saying it means hope

Thursday An alcoholic New York writer Don Birnam is packing for a weekend vacation with his brother Wick who is trying to discourage his drinking
When Don s girlfriend Helen comes to see them off she mentions in passing that she has two tickets for a concert to which Don urges Wick to accompany her
Don heads for Nat s Bar deliberately missing his train and then sneaks back into the flat to drink some cheap whisky he has bought avoiding Helen who is worried about him being left alone
Friday Back at the bar the owner Nat criticizes Don for treating Helen so badly and Don recalls how he first met her
It was due to a mix up of cloakroom tickets at the opera house where he had to wait for the person who had been given his coat check in error
This was Helen with whom he strikes up a romance
When he is due to meet her parents for lunch at a hotel he loses his nerve and phones a message to her crying off
Presently he confesses to her that he is two people Don the writer whose fear of failure causes him to drink and Don the drunk who always has to be bailed out by his brother
Still Helen devotes herself to helping him in his plight
Back in the present day Don has moved on to another bar where he is caught stealing money from a woman s purse to pay his bill and he is subsequently thrown out
In the flat he finds a bottle he had stashed the previous night and drinks himself into a stupor
Saturday Don is broke and all the pawnshops are closed for Yom Kippur
At Nat s Bar he is refused service
In desperation for money he visits a girl who has had a long held crush on him but stood her up during this latest binge
Leaving her flat he falls down the stairs and is knocked unconscious
Sunday Don wakes up in an alcoholics ward where Bim Nolan a cynical male nurse mocks him and other guests at Hangover Plaza but offers to help cure his delirium
Don refuses help and succeeds in escaping from the ward while the staff are occupied with a violent patient
Monday Still broke Don steals a bottle of whisky from a store and spends the day drinking and hallucinating
Helen returns alerted by a call from Don s landlady who can hear his screams
Finding him in a delirious state she vows to look after him and spends the night on his couch
Tuesday Don slips out and pawns Helen s coat the thing which had first brought them together in order to buy a gun
She trails him to the pawn shop and finds out from the pawnbroker that he traded the coat for a gun he had pawned earlier
She races to Don s apartment and catches him just before he is about to shoot himself in the bathroom
He tells her their relationship is over and she glimpses the gun which he has hidden in the bathroom
As they struggle for control of the weapon she reminds Don of her love for him and her concern that he should stop drinking
She is able to convince him that Don the writer and Don the drunk are the same person
He finally commits to writing his novel The Bottle dedicated to her which will recount the events of the weekend
He drops a cigarette into a glass of whiskey to make it undrinkable as proof that he is cured

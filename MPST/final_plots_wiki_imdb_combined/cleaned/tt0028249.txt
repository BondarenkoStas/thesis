Note Although the basic plot of Show Boat has always remained the same over the years revisions and alterations were made by the creators and over time by subsequent producers and directors
Some of these revisions were for length and some for convenience as when a different actor played a certain role and was unable to perform a specialty piece written for the role s creator
Some have been made to reflect contemporary sensitivities toward race gender and other social issues
Act I In 1887 the show boat Cotton Blossom arrives at the river dock in Natchez Mississippi
The Reconstruction era had ended a decade earlier and white dominated Southern legislatures have imposed racial segregation and Jim Crow rules
The boat s owner Cap n Andy Hawks introduces his actors to the crowd on the levee
A fistfight breaks out between Steve Baker the leading man of the troupe and Pete a rough engineer who had been making passes at Steve s wife the leading lady Julie La Verne a mixed race woman who passes as white
Steve knocks Pete down and Pete swears revenge suggesting he knows a dark secret about Julie
Cap n Andy pretends to the shocked crowd that the fight was a preview of one of the melodramas to be performed
The troupe exits with the showboat band and the crowd follows
A handsome riverboat gambler Gaylord Ravenal appears on the levee and is taken with eighteen year old Magnolia Hawks an aspiring performer and the daughter of Cap n Andy and his wife Parthenia Ann
Magnolia is likewise smitten with Ravenal
She seeks advice from Joe a black dock worker aboard the boat who has returned from buying flour for his wife Queenie the ship s cook
He replies that there are lots like Ravenal on the river
As Magnolia goes inside the boat to tell her friend Julie about the handsome stranger Joe mutters that she ought to ask the river for advice
He and the other dock workers reflect on the wisdom and indifference of Ol Man River who doesn t seem to care what the world s troubles are but jes keeps rollin along
Magnolia finds Julie inside and announces that she s in love
Julie cautions her that this stranger could be just a no account river fellow
Magnolia says that if she found out he was no account she d stop loving him
Julie warns her that it s not that easy to stop loving someone explaining that she ll always love Steve singing a few lines of Can t Help Lovin Dat Man
Queenie overhears she is surprised that Julie knows that song as she has only heard colored folks sing it
Magnolia remarks that Julie sings it all the time and when Queenie asks if she can sing the entire song Julie obliges
During the rehearsal for that evening Julie and Steve learn that the town sheriff is coming to arrest them
Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut on the back of her hand sucking the blood and swallowing it
Pete returns with the sheriff who insists that the show cannot proceed because Julie is a mulatto woman married to a white man and local laws prohibit such miscegenation
Julie admits that her mother was black but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has black blood in him so their marriage is legal in Mississippi
The troupe backs him up boosted by the ship s pilot Windy McClain a longtime friend of the sheriff
The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation but they still have to leave the show boat identified as black they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience
Cap n Andy fires Pete but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve he cannot violate the law for them
Gaylord Ravenal returns and asks for passage on the boat
Andy hires him as the new leading man and assigns his daughter Magnolia as the new leading lady over her mother s objections
As Magnolia and Ravenal begin to rehearse their roles and in the process kiss for the first time Joe reprises the last few lines of Ol Man River
Weeks later Magnolia and Ravenal have been a hit with the crowds and have fallen in love
As the levee workers hum Ol Man River in the background he proposes to Magnolia and she accepts
The couple joyously sings You Are Love
They make plans to marry the next day while Parthy who disapproves is out of town
Parthy has discovered that Ravenal once killed a man and arrives with the Sheriff to interrupt the wedding festivities
The group learns that Ravenal was acquitted of murder
Cap n Andy calls Parthy narrow minded and defends Ravenal by announcing that he also once killed a man
Parthy faints but the ceremony proceeds
Act II Six years have passed and it is 1893
Gaylord and Magnolia have moved to Chicago where they make a precarious living from Gaylord s gambling
At first they are rich and enjoying the good life singing the song Why Do I Love You
By 1903 they have a daughter Kim and after years of varying income they are broke and rent a room in a boarding house

Although he is uncertain about asking her to take him back Magnolia who has never stopped loving him greets him warmly and does
As the happy couple walks up the boat s gangplank Joe and the cast sing the last verse of Ol Man River
Plot variants in 1951 film The 1951 MGM film changed the final scenes of the story as well as many small details
It reconciled Ravenal and Magnolia a few years after they separated rather than 23
By a chance meeting with Julie Ravenal learns that Magnolia gave birth to his daughter

U 37 the first German submarine to reach Canada sinks a merchant ship in the Gulf of St Lawrence then runs for cover in Hudson Bay
Captain Bernsdorff sends men ashore to capture a trading post just before U 37 is destroyed by an RCAF bomber
Lieutenant Ernst Hirth eager but inexperienced leader of the shore party follows his orders regardless
In the trading post the Factor is updating French Canadian trapper Johnnie Barras on the outbreak of war when Hirth and his men burst in injuring the Eskimo servant Nick
After an edgy night a radio ham from Grand Rapids Michigan calls up for his regular chess game with the Factor and Johnnie shouts an alarm into the microphone
Jahner shoots him and he later dies
Knowing that a seaplane will come to the post to investigate the Nazis plan to hijack it and fly to the neutral U S A
They take the plane but Jahner is shot by an Eskimo marksman as it takes off
Kuhnecke misjudges the plane s fuel reserves and dies when it crashes into a lake still well north of the 49th parallel
The four survivors come upon a Hutterite community of émigré Germans led by Peter
The gentle Vogel befriends the fifteen year old Anna and impressed by the community s spirit volunteers to bake its bread
Hirth takes the Hutterites for secret Nazi sympathisers and openly appeals for their help at a general meeting where Peter angrily refuses him
While Hirth Kranz and Lohrmann prepare to move on Peter persuades Vogel to stay on as the baker
But Hirth returns and summarily executes him for desertion
The three Nazis reach Winnipeg and learn that the Mounties are on their trail
They set off for Vancouver intending to take a Japanese boat to Russia
Mounties suspect their presence at the Indian Day celebrations in Banff and Kranz is arrested when he panics and reveals his identity
Hirth and Lohrmann proceed on foot across the Rockies and stumble into the camp of Philip Armstrong Scott an English aesthete and academic researching the history and culture of the Blackfoot Sioux
They respond to his hospitality by burning his paintings books and research notes and tying him up but he breaks free and captures Lohrmann
The wounded Hirth hops the freight car of a train heading for the U S border and overpowers fellow stowaway Andy Brock an AWOL Canadian soldier
The train halts at Niagara Falls and Hirth identifies himself to the U S customs officers demanding to be taken to the German embassy
But Brock persuades them to classify himself and Hirth as improperly manifested freight and to return his carriage to Canada
Now disarmed Hirth is no match for Brock s fists

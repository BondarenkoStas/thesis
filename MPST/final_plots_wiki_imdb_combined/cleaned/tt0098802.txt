Chris Peterson is a carefree childlike bachelor who refuses to live the life of an adult
At the age of 30 Chris still lives with his parents and maintains a career delivering the St Paul Pioneer Press a job that he has held since his youth
He has no driver s license
He is depicted as being childish naive gullible foolish occasionally irresponsible and extremely dimwitted
His lack of intelligence is exaggerated to absurd levels at one point he tries to leave his parents house but is unable to operate the front door
He also fell out of an airplane after opening the plane s airlock believing that the EXIT sign was a restroom
Chris parents are a vapid middle aged couple who are almost always seen in their pajamas and robes
They are often shown doing something abnormal like polishing handguns or trying to shoot the deer that ate the flowerbulbs out of their garden
Gladys is a smiling caring mother who doted over Chris though often makes cynical passive aggressive comments about him and his lifestyle
Fred is a much more blunt wise cracking old man who is constantly exasperated by his son and seems to have a reckless disregard for Chris well being
In the early episodes Chris wanted little more than to spend his days reliving his childhood with his father and his best friend Larry
Larry was Chris friend since childhood but unlike Chris Larry has since grown up owns a house works a dead end job as an accountant and has two children and a wife Sharon
Sharon is an overbearing housewife who does not want her husband associating with Chris preferring instead that he make friends with more sophisticated socialites that better befits their image
Sharon despises Chris and Chris takes any opportunity to irritate her
Larry is envious of Chris carefree lifestyle and is often coerced by Chris into joining him in his adventures despite his wife s wishes
To Chris dismay Larry eventually heeds his advice and leaves his wife and children at the beginning of the second season
This leaves Sharon traumatized and she becomes more and more obsessed with killing Chris in revenge
In a defiant nod to Fox Network demands that his character be more independent Chris Peterson was moved out of his parents house at the beginning of the second season much to his parents amazement and joy and into the garage of ex cop Gus Borden played by Brian Doyle Murray who had been fired from the police force for urinating on his boss
He is a gruff demeaning sociopath with minimal tolerance for Chris antics which Chris seems to be oblivious to while looking up to Gus as a sort of paternal figure
For that reason Gus serves as Chris comic foil throughout the second season
One of the more controversial episodes featured a character named Spewey the Alien an extraterrestrial who secretes mucus from under his scales and projectile vomits when he becomes emotionally overwrought
At the end of the episode Peterson and Gus barbecued and ate Spewey although the creature was resurrected inside their refrigerator

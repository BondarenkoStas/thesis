As a defense attorney Arthur is familiar with both the courts and the minds of criminals and he spends much of the film consulting an officious imaginary version of himself as to the perfect scheme to rid himself of Lousie

Eventually Arthur s mistress Jackie Willis confronts Louise in secret
The two concoct their own scheme to do away Arthur and make it look like suicide
The two confront Arthur at gunpoint planning to stage his murder as a suicide
Unfazed Arthur takes control of the situation pointing out the flaws and poking holes in what was supposed to be a foolproof scheme
Arthur is revealed to have been cheating on Jackie and while Louise was trying to murder him he was being missed by a date thus ruling out suicide
Worse Arthur reveals that he had been recording the entire episode on tape with which he blackmails Louise
Louise hysterical at the collapse of her plan chases her husband with the gun
A brief struggle ensues and she is shot dead
Ironically Louise s accidental death implicates Arthur for murdering her
Arthur was only bluffing about the tape leaving no evidence that the shooting was an accident other than the word of Jackie his mistress
All of the evidence points to Arthur deliberately murdering his wife
Arthur now imagines himself in court his imaginary self now his prosecutor
At this point the film shows Arthur back at home again poking holes in the scheme now revealed to be yet one more of his unrealized plans
At this point Louise arrives home shoots him dead and phones Jackie to inform her that the deed is done
The film ends with Louise rearranging the living room to cover up evidence of murder

Following the introduction sequence set in Arkham Asylum psychiatric hospital the game begins on September 6 1915 as police detective Jack Walters is summoned to the siege of a decrepit manor house in Boston
The manor is inhabited by a bizarre cult called the Fellowship of the Yith led by one Victor Holt who has asked specifically for Walters to come and talk to him
Taking cover from an ensuing firefight Walters finds himself separated from the police and trapped inside the mansion with no option but to investigate
When the rest of the police finally break in they find the cultists dead by mass suicide and Walters apparently insane
He is committed to Arkham sanatorium where he stays for six years
Walters is released and becomes a private investigator
On February 6 1922 he takes up a missing person case at Innsmouth a xenophobic coastal town and the site of the recent disappearance of Brian Burnham a clerk that had been sent there to establish a local store for the First National Grocery chain
Arriving in the isolated town which appears to be depopulated and in a state of collapse Jack unsuccessfully asks around for Brian
He stays the night at a hotel where he barely escapes an assassination attempt and then flees from a chase by an armed mob
From that point forward Jack is forced to sneak through the alleys buildings and sewers of Innsmouth avoiding murderous patrols of the town s corrupt police and the cultists looking for him
He acquires weapons to defend himself and meets undercover agent Lucas Mackey who tells him that the town is under federal investigation
Jack eventually finds Burnham and his girlfriend Ruth but their car crashes when they escape from Innsmouth killing Brian and injuring Jack
Jack recovers from the incident and following a brutal interrogation he is taken in by the FBI squad led by J Edgar Hoover
On February 8 Jack helps Hoover and the FBI raid the Marsh Gold Refinery where he is attacked by an ancient creature known as a Shoggoth and uncovers a Cthulhu shrine before the building is demolished
After the refinery raid the U S military begins a combined land and sea assault on Innsmouth on February 9
The only part of the town that proves resistant to the attack is the headquarters of the Esoteric Order of Dagon a cult devoted to two undersea demigods and Cthulhu that holds the whole town under its grip
The building proves unbreachable for the Coast Guard and the Marines but Jack finds a way in through an old smuggling entrance that is guarded by a star spawn of Cthulhu
Inside Jack frees Agent Mackey who has been kidnapped for a ritual sacrifice and brings down the magical shield protecting the building
After discovering a secret chamber he falls through the floor of a tunnel which leads into the sea
Jack is rescued by the USS Urania a Coast Guard vessel which is part of a group heading to Devil s Reef on February 10 following up on a lead provided by the FBI
On the way there wizards on the reef summon powerful tidal waves to destroy the flotilla but Jack kills them
The humanoid fish men known as Deep Ones launch a mass attack on the Urania and eventually Dagon emerges too
Jack manages to defeat the gigantic demigod but Urania sinks
Jack survives and finds himself on Devil s Reef where he discovers old smuggling tunnels beneath the seabed leading him to the underwater city of Y ha nthlei
The city is found to be located below Devil s Reef and is the home of the Deep Ones and members of the Order
U S Navy submarines attempt to torpedo Y ha nthlei but are stopped by a magical barrier protecting the city
The Temple of Dagon is the source of the barrier but the entrance is sealed off to prevent any interference
Jack finds another way in through ancient tunnels feared by the Deep Ones at the bottom of the city s foundations
Apparently this passage which leads to the temple is an ancient prison for flying polyps the enemy of the Great Race of Yith
Jack manages to defeat them with the help of a Yithian energy weapon
Jack then enters the Temple of Dagon and kills Mother Hydra whose song is generating the barrier by deafening some of the Deep Ones to her song allowing him to take control of them
With the barrier down the submarines attack the city while Jack escapes through a portal leading back to the Order s headquarters and collapses in front of Hoover and Mackey
In the end it is revealed that a Yithian swapped minds with Jack Walters father during the moment of Jack s conception
In flesh Jack Walters is human but he inherited Yithian psychic powers which was the reason for the cultists interest in him and explains why he has visions of coming danger and of the Yithian library city of Pnakotus as well as his ability to control Deep Ones in the Temple of Dagon
Returning to the introductory scene confined in Arkham Asylum once more Jack hangs himself on February 16 1922 unable to handle the reality of himself and what he has witnessed
The game is supposed to be based on the writings in Jack s journal which were discovered in 1924

It s an experiment in human behavior
It s an exploration of the most natural of animal impulses
It s something new under the moon
And it bites
When security dispatcher Aaron Scates is blinded in an explosion he s put in the care of Dr Andrea Hewlitt famous in her field for spearheading extraordinary though controversial medical breakthroughs
Her newest is cross species organ transplants and Aaron is her first human subject
When a severely wounded wolf is brought to Dr Hewlitt s office by museum curator Lydia Armstrong Dr Hewlitt leaps on the opportunity and successfully transplants the wolf s eyes to Aaron despite Lydia s objections
Aaron however is thrilled
Not only can he see again he can see in the dark
He also develops an unusually acute sense of hearing and tears into a raw steak like never before
Unfortunately he also begins to growl and to target people as prey
Lydia knows why
Knowing Aaron is in danger to himself and to others Lydia confesses that she too is a cross breed but has learned to channel her feral instincts into a source of strength not violence with the help of her shaman friend Claude Robertson
After Lydia and Aaron explore their other animal instincts in the privacy of Lydia s lair she takes him to Claude s for a rite of passage to integrate the young man s spirit with that of a wolf
But Dr Hewitt s colleagues who have seen Aaron s wilder side are determined to hunt the beast down and destroy him
What they don t know is that Aaron has more on his side than a shaman and an empathetic girlfriend
He s made some new friends at the zoo
They travel in packs
And they don t need a full moon to commune

Gary Sherman s Death Line is one of those little seen long forgotten 1970s horror films that s still championed by its core of fans
When the film was shown as part of a horror series at Lincoln Center in 2002 director Guillermo Del Toro pronounced it one of his all time favorites
In the film Patricia and her American boyfriend Alex find an important government official apparently unconscious on the stairs of a London Underground station
By the time they locate a cop to investigate the body is gone
The sarcastically cynical Inspector Calhoun and his right hand man Rogers take on the case
The culprit turns out to be a deranged man the descendent of tunnel workers who were trapped in a cave in and abandoned by the government at the turn of the century
The Man lives in the abandoned tunnel with his mate the Woman and ventures into the Underground proper only to find hapless human victims and bring them back to their decrepit lair for food
When his mate dies the Man goes in search of another
Put off by Alex s lack of compassion Patricia splits up with him venturing into a train station alone and before long she finds herself in the underground hellhole
Christopher Lee makes a cameo appearance as an officious meddlesome MI5
Much to Sherman s chagrin his film was re edited by the producers and released to American grind houses under the title Raw Meat
It was shown in Britain in its original form under its original title

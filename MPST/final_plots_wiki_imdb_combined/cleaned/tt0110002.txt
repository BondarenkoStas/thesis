Aboard the Nellie anchored in the River Thames near Gravesend England Charles Marlow tells his fellow sailors about the events that led to his appointment as captain of a river steamboat for an ivory trading company
As a child Marlow had been fascinated by the blank spaces on maps particularly by the biggest which by the time he had grown up was no longer blank but turned into a place of darkness
Yet there remained a big river resembling an immense snake uncoiled with its head in the sea its body at rest curving afar over a vast country and its tail lost in the depths of the land
The image of this river on the map fascinated Marlow as a snake would a bird
Feeling as though instead of going to the centre of a continent I were about to set off for the centre of the earth Marlow takes passage on a French steamer bound for the African coast and then into the interior
After more than thirty days the ship anchors off the seat of the government near the mouth of the big river
Marlow still some two hundred miles to go now takes passage on a little sea going steamer captained by a Swede
He departs some thirty miles up the river where his Company s station is
Work on the railway is going on involving removal of rocks with explosives
Marlow enters a narrow ravine to stroll in the shade under the trees and finds himself in the gloomy circle of some Inferno the place is full of diseased Africans who worked on the railroad and now await their deaths their sickened bodies already as thin as air
Marlow witnesses the scene horror struck
Marlow has to wait for ten days in the Company s Outer Station where he sleeps in a hut
At this station which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation he meets the Company s impeccably dressed chief accountant who tells him of a Mr Kurtz who is in charge of a very important trading post and a widely respected first class agent a very remarkable person who Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together
The agent predicts that Kurtz will go very far He will be a somebody in the Administration before long
They above the Council in Europe you know mean him to be
Marlow departs with a caravan of sixty men to travel on foot some two hundred miles into the wilderness to the Central Station where the steamboat that he is to captain is based
On the fifteenth day of his march he arrives at the station which has some twenty employees and is shocked to learn from a fellow European that his steamboat had been wrecked in a mysterious accident two days earlier
He meets the General Manager who informs him that he could wait no longer for Marlow to arrive because the up river stations had to be relieved and rumors had one important station in jeopardy because its chief the exceptional Mr Kurtz was ill Hang Kurtz Marlow thinks irritated
He fishes his boat out of the river and is occupied with its repair for some months during which a sudden fire destroys a grass shed full of materials used to trade with the natives
While one of the natives is tortured for allegedly causing the fire Marlow is invited in the room of the station s brick maker a man who spent a year waiting for material to make bricks
Marlow gets the impression the man wants to pump him and is curious to know what kind of information he is after
Hanging on the wall is a small sketch in oils on a panel representing a woman draped and blindfolded carrying a lighted torch
Marlow is fascinated with the sinister effect of the torchlight upon the woman s face and is informed that Mr Kurtz made the painting in the station a year ago
The brick maker calls Kurtz a prodigy and an emissary of pity and science and progress and feels Kurtz represents the higher intelligence wide sympathies a singleness of purpose needed for the cause Europe entrusts the Company with
The man predicts Kurtz will rise in the hierarchy within two years and then makes the connection to Marlow The same people who sent him specially also recommended you
Marlow is frustrated by the months it takes to perform the necessary repairs made all the slower by the lack of proper tools and replacement parts at the station
During this time he learns that Kurtz is far from admired but more or less resented
Once underway the journey up river to Kurtz s station takes two months to the day
The steamboat stops briefly near an abandoned hut on the riverbank where Marlow finds a pile of wood and a note indicating that the wood is for them and that they should proceed quickly but with caution as they near the Inner Station
The journey pauses for the night about eight miles below the Inner Station
In the morning the crew awakens to find that the boat is enveloped by a thick white fog
From the riverbank they hear a very loud cry followed by a discordant clamour
A few hours later as safe navigation becomes increasingly difficult the steamboat is attacked with a barrage of small arrows from the forest
The helmsman is impaled by a spear and falls at Marlow s feet
Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly frightening the attackers and causing the shower of arrows to cease
Marlow and a pilgrim watch the helmsman die
In a flash forward Marlow notes that the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs had commissioned Kurtz to write a report which he did eloquently
A handwritten postscript apparently added later by Kurtz reads Exterminate all the brutes

At Kurtz s station Marlow sees a man on the riverbank waving his arm urging them to land
The pilgrims heavily armed escort the manager on to the shore to retrieve Mr Kurtz
The man from the bank boards the steamboat and turns out to be a Russian wanderer who had happened to stray into Kurtz s camp
He explains that he had left the wood and the note at the abandoned hut
Through conversation Marlow discovers just how wanton Kurtz can be how the natives worship him and how very ill he has been of late
The Russian admires Kurtz for his intellect and his insights into love life and justice and suggests that he is a poet
He tells of how Kurtz opened his mind and seems to admire him even for his power and for his willingness to use it
Marlow on the other hand suggests that Kurtz has gone mad
From the steamboat Marlow observes the station in detail and is surprised to see near the station house a row of posts topped with the severed heads of natives
Around the corner of the house the manager appears with the pilgrims bearing a gaunt and ghost like Kurtz on an improvised stretcher
The area fills with natives apparently ready for battle but Kurtz shouts something from the stretcher and the natives retreat into the forest
The pilgrims carry Kurtz to the steamer and lay him in one of the cabins where he and the manager have a private conversation
Marlow watches a beautiful native woman walk in measured steps along the shore and stop next to the steamer
When the manager exits the cabin he pulls Marlow aside and tells him that Kurtz has harmed the Company s business in the region that his methods are unsound
Later the Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the Company wants to remove him from the station and kill him and Marlow confirms that hangings had been discussed
After midnight Marlow discovers that Kurtz has left his cabin on the steamer and returned to shore
He goes ashore and finds a very weak Kurtz crawling his way back to the station house though not too weak to call to the natives for help
Marlow threatens to harm Kurtz if he raises an alarm but Kurtz only laments that he had not accomplished more in the region
The next day they prepare for their journey back down the river
The natives including the ornately dressed woman once again assemble on shore and begin to shout unintelligibly
Noticing the pilgrims readying their rifles Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly to scatter the crowd of natives
Only the woman remains unmoved with outstretched arms
The pilgrims open fire as the current carries them swiftly downstream
Kurtz s health worsens on the return trip and Marlow himself becomes increasingly ill
The steamboat breaks down and while it is stopped for repairs Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers including his commissioned report and a photograph telling him to keep them away from the manager
When Marlow next speaks with him Kurtz is near death as he dies Marlow hears him weakly whisper The horror
The horror

A short while later the manager s boy announces to the rest of the crew in a scathing tone Mistah Kurtz he dead
The next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury something in a muddy hole
He falls very ill himself near death
Upon his return to Europe Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the civilised world
Many callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz had entrusted to him but Marlow withholds them or offers papers he knows they have no interest in
He then gives Kurtz s report to a journalist for publication if he sees fit
Finally Marlow is left with some personal letters and a photograph of Kurtz s fianc√©e whom Kurtz referred to as My Intended
When Marlow visits her she is dressed in black and still deep in mourning although it has been more than a year since Kurtz s death
She presses Marlow for information asking him to repeat Kurtz s final words which in fact are The horror
The horror
Uncomfortable Marlow lies and tells her that Kurtz s final word was her name

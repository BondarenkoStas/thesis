Henery Hawk is talking with his father about wanting to get a chicken but the father dissuades him as he would get in the way
Notably Henery s father lies about what a chicken looks like leaving Henery in the dark as to what a chicken really is
Henery s father raids a chicken coop and walks out with a couple of chickens but is stopped by Foghorn who doesn t let the elder chickenhawk make off with the traumatized chickens and get a word in edgewise before deliberately literally bumping him in the stomach and kicking him out
When Henery asks his dad if that was a chicken the father claims Foghorn isn t a chicken but a loud mouthed shnook
Henery goes over to Barnyard Dawg s house and knocks the dog out with a hammer
Foghorn stops them and asks Henery what he thinks Foghorn is to which Henery replies that Foghorn is a loud mouthed shnook
Foghorn isn t helped when the dog wakes up and kicks him calling him a shnook
Foghorn continues to try and convince Henery that I m a chicken
Rooster that is
He tries to crow at sun up but that does not work
Henery exits before Foghorn can even finish his demonstration leaving only two signs in his absence
The first read Shnook
and the second said Loud Mouth d That Is
When Henery pushes along a trunk Foghorn again tries to straighten Henery out but his emphasising by hitting the trunk winds up hitting the Barnyard Dawg who chases Foghorn up a ladder and into a watermelon after which Foghorn mutters Some days it don t pay to get outta bed
When Henery throws a stick of dynamite into the Barnyard Dawg s house Foghorn tries to stop the explosion but the dog slams Foghorn to the ground several times and finally calls him a good for nothing chicken which is enough for Henery he knocks Foghorn down with a shovel and starts dragging him away
Although Foghorn now calls himself a loudmouthed shnook Henery says Chicken or shnook in our oven he ll look good

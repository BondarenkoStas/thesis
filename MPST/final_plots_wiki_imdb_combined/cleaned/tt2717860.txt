Alistair and Miles both with aristocratic connections start their first year at Oxford University
Though they are very different Miles is friendly and level headed who does not care that his girlfriend Lauren comes from a lower background whilst Alistair is an insecure arrogant and cold hearted snob with aspirations to follow his friend s uncle Jeremy a Conservative MP the common ground is that they both become members of the Riot Club a long established elite drinking club priding itself on hedonism and the belief that money can buy anything
Alistair takes the club in more of a competitive fashion and ends up hating Miles
Having been barred from most establishments in Oxford they have their annual dinner at the function room in a country pub where their raucous behaviour annoys other patrons though they reimburse Chris the landlord
After hiring a prostitute who refuses to perform group oral sex Alistair takes Miles phone and texts Lauren without Miles knowing whom they proposition to Miles disgust
Getting progressively more drunk and ingesting drugs they start to wreck the room and when Chris comes to confront them Alistair punches him followed by the others who viciously attack him sending him to hospital
Miles attempts to stop them by calling for an ambulance
The boys are all arrested but believing that the club is more important than the individual they agree not to give statements and go on to suggest that Miles as the newest club member should take the blame for the attack on Chris
Alistair s skin is then found underneath Chris fingernails meaning they can arrest and charge him
Miles now ex girlfriend refuses to talk to him and Miles is approached by the new president of the Riot Club to re join next year but after nearly having to leave university because of this scandal he decides to leave the club a decision which the new president mocks
Alistair is invited to a meeting with Jeremy who asks for the Riot Club to be kept out of future court appearances and assures Alistair that in spite of being kicked out of Oxford the boy is still a Riot member
Though Alistair is at first aggressively dismissive of Jeremy s proposed assistance Alistair is brought around when Jeremy offers the boy a position in his office and an assured future
The film concludes with Alistair leaving the meeting with Jeremy a smug smile on his face as he walks down the street

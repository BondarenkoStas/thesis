In the opening sequence four airmen from Clark Air Base in Washington D C frantically attempt to escape the base
A contingent of soldiers soon blocks their path
Most of the escapees are shot but one sees a flying saucer which burns him to a crisp with its energy weapon
Frank Mccall is an overqualified photojournalist writing about two headed dogs and alien abductions for the sleazy National Scandal tabloid
When the airman s charred corpse is found he is assigned to the story
When government agents try to keep him out he resolves to sneak into the airbase where a top secret fighter plane is to be demoed that night
The plane is equipped with an experimental software system called A S M O D S which suddenly malfunctions mid demo crashing the plane
As the disappointed top brass go home Mccall is intercepted by Captain Anders who orders him taken into custody and his camera seized
Sinister men in black wrench Mccall away taking him to a storage compartment to be injected with a glowing green substance and brainwashed with an electronic apparatus
Anders and Colonel Faraday arrive in time to stop them and the men shoot themselves
Anders takes Mccall into custody himself while Faraday returns to the base
Suddenly the flying saucer from the opening appears
Anders shoots it to no effect while Mccall photographs it with his backup disc camera
Powerless against the invader they drive away dodging more men in black on the way and lock themselves in the base
Mccall s camera is again confiscated its photos to be developed as evidence
Mccall manages to secure the prints and also spies on Anders conversing with the General
He thus finds out that the A S M O D S
system uses alien technology recovered from a crashed spaceship in the New Mexico desert and this technology seems to have a mind of its own
The men in black break their way in so Mccall escapes with Anders in the F 117 stealth fighter
They have a brief dogfight with some F 16s out of Clark which ends when they manage to secure air support from the Pentagon
Mccall and Anders are questioned and eventually manage to convince General Anheiser that A S M O D S
has taken over the base computers using the intranet and brainwashed all of the soldiers into its control
They agree to go investigate the next day
In between time Mccall quits his job at the Scandal realizing he is onto the story of the century
At the airbase the trio is greeted by a now brainwashed Faraday
His troops destroy their helicopter escort and he takes them down to the subbasement which has been excavated into a gaping cavern
There Faraday reveals the alien s plan it cannibalized the base hardware to build a giant robot HARV with which to conquer the world after nuking China and Russia
Mccall realizes that just as the alien programming seeped into A S M O D S so A S M O D S
has seeped into the alien arming it with a nationalistic impulse to destroy America s enemies
The protagonists manage to shoot Faraday s guards
HARV tries to stop them but only succeeds in killing Faraday
They search the basement for weapons with which to destroy HARV and avert World War III
They find a rocket launcher and two rockets their first attempt misses but the second is a direct hit with one second to spare before HARV would launch the missiles
The ending sequence shows several newspapers honoring Mccall for his heroics while the National Scandal claims the alien invasion was a hoax

Faced with bankruptcy and having had no reply to its protests the Duchy decides to declare war on the United States Mountjoy having reasoned that it will certainly lose and will then be magnificently rehabilitated by the generous victorious Americans
A Declaration of War is duly sent but is considered a press room joke by its recipient in Washington Tully Bascombe his lieutenant Will Buckley and twenty soldiers in chain mail and armed with longbows including Roger and Cobbley and are sent to invade the United States making the first part of their journey by bus and then by tramp steamer captained by Pedro encountering en route the QEII which they mistakenly attack In New York an air raid exercise has closed the entire city with the exception of the laboratory of Professor Alfred Kokintz at the New York Institute of Physics where he and his daughter Helen are working on the new Q bomb an air raid warden tries to get them to take shelter but the Professor shows him the Q bomb an active working model on a hair trigger which he must deactivate first
The Grand Fenwick party land but can find no one to surrender to in Central Park they encounter a decontamination squad Mulligan and O Hara who believe the Fenwickians in their shiny mail are men from Mars invading the city this rumour rapidly spreads through the crowds in the shelters
The Grand Fenwick party takes the decontamination squad s van trying to reach the Arsenal but instead end up at the Institute of Physics where they take Prof Kokintz Helen and the Q bomb captive General Snippet in charge of the New York exercise alerted by an army captain of the spread of rumours of men from Mars arrives with four New York policemen they are also taken captive
Leaving the Grand Fenwick flag flying from the New York customs shed the Grand Fenwick party re embarks and returns home
Prof Kokintz persuades Helen to try and seduce Tully to persuade him to allow her father to deactivate the Q bomb but Tully seasick is unreceptive
In France the Americans cannot get anyone to listen to them Back in Grand Fenwick the whole country is excitedly preparing to welcome the American victors and planning what to spend the money on they are dumbfounded when Tully arrives with his prisoners and declares that Grand Fenwick won
The Q bomb is taken to the dungeons Prof Kokintz and his daughter to the castle and the General and policemen to the Museum of Ancient Torture before the policemen are also taken to comfortable quarters in the castle the General insisting on his exact rights under the Geneva Convention is shown to a small dim cell with a tin plate of food The U S Secretary of Defense finally puts together the pieces and realizes that the United States has been defeated he has to tell the President persuade the Pentagon generals that this is the only course and then go to Grand Fenwick to surrender
Meanwhile Grand Fenwick by its possession of the Q bomb has now become the most powerful nation on the planet as explained by the BBC Announcer In Grand Fenwick s parliament messages of support arrive from numerous other countries all offering also to take the Q bomb
The British French and Soviet Ambassadors convene at the frontier and Will Buckley makes the U S Secretary of Defense arriving to discuss the U S s surrender wait also
In frustration Mountjoy and Bentner and their parties all resign leaving Tully as the new Prime Minister Mountjoy and Bentner now decide the only course is to help the Americans to escape and take the Q bomb with them they release the General and policemen and give them the Q bomb and they also persuade Helen to leave but not before Tully has declared his love for her Prof Kokintz being entertained by the Duchess on the harpsichord cannot be found
Taking the Duchess elderly car the Americans drive away but are pursued by Tully
The car stalls and has to be pushed over a hill crest it then runs away with the General and the Q bomb on board running into a haystack which sets the Q bomb into high alert mode tossed from hand to hand it is captured by Tully and returned to the Duchy Tully and the U S Secretary of Defense now discuss the peace treaty terms the Californian wine will be discontinued Prof Kokintz and Helen who will now marry Tully will remain in Grand Fenwick and so will the Q bomb as the Duchess points out any atomic war would destroy Grand Fenwick anyway and the big nations have not succeeded in nuclear disarmament so now it is time for a League of Little Nations to try Prof
Kokintz finally allowed to disarm the Q bomb drops it
It was a dud all along or was it
The little white mouse that emerges from it may know

Michael Redgrave plays Leo in old age
Pinter s screenplay for the film was his final collaboration with Losey following The Servant and Accident
It is largely faithful to the novel although it alludes to the novel s opening events in dialogue where Leo is held in admiration by the students due to their belief he caused injury to two bullies through black magic and incorporates events described in the novel s epilogue within the central narrative

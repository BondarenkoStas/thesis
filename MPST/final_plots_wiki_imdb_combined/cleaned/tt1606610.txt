Story The day after celebrating his son Jason s 10th birthday Ethan Mars and his family go shopping at a local mall
While buying some balloons from a clown Ethan notices that Jason has wandered off and frantically searches for him
Eventually he finds him outside in the middle of the street right in the path of an oncoming car
Ethan tries to push him out of the way but Jason is struck and killed
After waking up from a six month coma Ethan blaming himself for Jason s death divorces his wife and moves into a small suburban house
He develops severe mental trauma and starts experiencing blackouts at an alarming rate
Two years later while at the park with Shaun Ethan suddenly blacks out
When he wakes up Shaun has vanished
To his horror he soon discovers that Shaun was kidnapped by the Origami Killer a serial murderer whose modus operandi consists of abducting young boys during the fall season drowning them in rainwater and leaving an orchid on their chests and an origami figure nearby as calling cards
FBI profiler Norman Jayden brought in to assist with the hunt for the killer investigates the death of another Origami victim and concludes that he died the same day as a violent rainstorm which flooded the cell where he was kept
Based on weather patterns he estimates that Shaun has only three days to live
Besieged by reporters Ethan checks into a motel
He receives a letter from the killer which leads to a shoebox containing a mobile phone a handgun and five origami figures
The killer calls him and explains that each of the figures contains instructions on how to complete a trial which will allow him to determine how much Ethan loves his son
If he chooses to complete them then he will receive a piece of the address where Shaun is held
The trials force Ethan to make increasingly difficult moral decisions including driving against traffic at high speeds on the highway crawling through a maze composed of active electrical pylons cutting off one of his fingers breaking into the apartment of a drug dealer and murdering him in front of his family and drinking a glass of poison on camera
While undergoing the trials he meets Madison Paige a journalist who occasionally checks into the motel to deal with her chronic insomnia
She sympathizes with Ethan s plight and decides to conduct her own investigation into the Origami Killer
Jayden and his partner Lieutenant Carter Blake investigate several suspects including a butcher and a religious fanatic but nothing pans out until Grace Mars arrives at the station fearing that her former husband is involved in Shaun s disappearance
After Ethan s psychiatrist reveals that his patient has a history of blackouts Blake and his superiors put out a warrant for his arrest
Unconvinced Jayden continues to investigate other leads
During these events private investigator Scott Shelby meets with the families of the Origami Killer s victims collecting the letters and other items they received when their loved ones were abducted
One of them a prostitute named Lauren Winter persuades Scott to let her accompany him
Their investigation leads them to an attention seeking playboy who claims to be the killer but when they try to question him they are knocked out and wake up in a car sinking to the bottom of a river
After getting Lauren to safety Scott tracks down the kid s father and forces him to confess that he was responsible for an accident that occurred years before in which a little boy was killed
Ending Throughout the game the player experiences two separate flashbacks that reveal the true nature of the Origami Killer
The first takes place 34 years earlier with two twin brothers playing in a construction site
One of the two John Sheppard falls into a broken pipe and gets his leg trapped just as a rainstorm causes the pipe to begin filling with water
The second occurs shortly after with John s brother running home to warn their father only to find him too drunk to help
Scared and confused the boy could only watch helplessly as his brother drowned
Thus the Origami Killer was born a killer who searches for a father willing to sacrifice himself
He kills his victims the same way his brother died
The boy turns out to be Scott after he reached adulthood he changed his surname to Shelby
His actions as an investigator are not meant to get justice for his victims rather he needed to collect the evidence of his crimes which he burns in his office wastebasket
The final chapter of the game titled The Old Warehouse serves as the climax
Each of the three main characters have the opportunity to find the warehouse where Shaun is rescue him and stop the Origami Killer depending on their actions and choices throughout the game
In all there are eight possible endings
If Ethan goes alone he can either save Shaun or watch him die and either spare or kill Shelby
Regardless of what he does he will be shot dead by the police when he tries to escape
If all three make it Ethan and Madison will have to save Shaun while Norman deals with Shelby
If Ethan fails to arrive or Norman dies Madison can help the other one rescue Shaun and fight Shelby and if neither arrive Madison will perform the rescue and the fight herself
Once the chapter is complete a series of clips and news reports will play and then the player will learn what happened to each character
Each ending is determined by what occurred in the final chapter
The best ending shows Ethan and his son starting a family with Madison Lauren spitting on Scott s grave after cursing his memory and Norman retiring from the FBI to focus on treating his addiction
The worst shows Madison and Norman dead with Ethan being successfully framed as the Origami Killer by Blake and Scott escaping in the chaos
Giving in to his pain Ethan commits suicide in his cell
Heavy Rain Chronicles The Chronicles are prequel segments that take place during the initial murders of the Origami Killer
The first one The Taxidermist was released on 1 April 2010 available for purchase from the PlayStation Network
It was also included with the original game when pre purchased from selected retailers
The original intention was for there to be four episodes which would focus on the main characters backgrounds
In July 2010 David Cage of Quantic Dream announced that future downloadable content would be put on indefinite hiatus due to Heavy Rain Move Edition taking up the production time allocated to the Chronicles
Once the Move Edition development was completed the team planned to either go back to working on the Chronicles or move on
Ultimately the team decided to cancel the rest of the series so that they could focus on Quantic Dream s next title Beyond Two Souls
In October 2014 Cage announced that Heavy Rain Chronicles has been cancelled and confirms that the team is currently not working on it
The first and only episode The Taxidermist follows Madison as she visits Leland White a taxidermist to question him about the Origami Killer

After collecting information Madison hears Leland s car return
From here the player s actions can lead to several different endings she can surprise Leland and kill him be killed herself and added to his collection escape or contact the police and wait for them to arrest Leland
Regardless of what happens it becomes clear that he has no connection to the Origami murders

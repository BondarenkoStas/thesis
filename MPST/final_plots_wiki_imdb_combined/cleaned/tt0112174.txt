A group of teenagers go on a school camp in the Blue Mountains in Australia
While at the camp Paul Reynolds accidentally goes into a parallel universe
This other world is inhabited by a more hierarchic and technologically different society ruled by a group of people known as Spellbinders
Paul meets a girl there named Riana and they become friends
The Spellbinders have discovered the power to create and manipulate static electricity
They fly in gigantic copper coloured machines that utilise large rotating orange crystals presumably creating some form of magnetic levitation
The Spellbinders often use their power for good but some abuse this power and use their discoveries for malevolence
One such malevolent Spellbinder is Ashka who often manages to hide her true nature
Common people are often banished for their misdeeds and sometimes Spellbinders are banished also if they are proven to have done wrong
There is tension from Paul s forays into the land of the Spellbinders and his attempts to return to his own universe and also from conversations Paul has with his friends across the barrier between the two universes
Paul and Riana s escapes also add tension as do the interactions between Spellbinders
Paul is eventually able to travel back home but he is forced to take Riana with him in order to save her
Later when Paul is able to take Riana back home the Spellbinder Ashka follows Paul as he later returns home
Ashka seeks the unwitting help of Paul s father in making her a new high tech flying suit to replace her power suit in order to make her more powerful than the other Spellbinders
However Paul manages to expose her scheme and defeat Ashka who is returned as an outcast to the Spellbinder world while Riana becomes the new apprentice to Correon
In order to keep the Spellbinder world safe from the more advanced people from modern world the gateway between the two universes is closed permanently

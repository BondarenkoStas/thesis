Misfit Captain Fisby is sent to Americanize the village of Tobiki on Okinawa the largest of the Ryukyu Islands
His commanding officer Colonel Wainwright Purdy III assigns him a wily local Sakini as interpreter
Fisby tries to implement the military s plans by encouraging the villagers to build a school in the shape of a pentagon but they want to build a teahouse instead
Fisby gradually becomes assimilated to the local customs and mores with the help of Sakini and Lotus Blossom a young geisha
To revive the economy he has the Okinawans manufacture small items to sell as souvenirs but nobody wants to buy them
These include cricket cages and wooden Japanese footwear called geta
Then Fisby makes a happy discovery
The villagers distill a potent sweet potato brandy in a matter of days which finds a ready market in the American army
With the influx of money the teahouse is built in next to no time
When Purdy sends psychiatrist Captain McLean to check up on Fisby the newcomer is quickly won over
This even after Fisby greets McLean wearing geta an army bathrobe and what Fisby terms an air conditioned straw hat
McLean later proves to be enthusiastic about organic farming
When Purdy doesn t hear from either officer he shows up in person and surprises Fisby and McLean the latter wearing a yukata
They are leading a rowdy song at a party in full swing in the teahouse
Purdy orders the building and distillery destroyed
In a burst of foresight the villagers break up old water urns rather than the brandy storage and only dismantle the teahouse hiding the sections
Ironically the village is chosen by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers as an example of successful American led democratization
This leads to Colonel Purdy s regretting his actions and to reassembling the teahouse

Amarkant Varma is a program executive for All India Radio dispatched from New Delhi to cover festivities in Assam
On his way there he meets a mysterious woman whose beauty intrigues him
She ignores his attempts at conversation and he sees her board the next train with three men
Later Amar spots the same woman in Haflong
He again attempts to talk to her but she says she cannot recall meeting him before
As part of his news assignment covering 50 years of India s independence Amar interviews an extremist leader who claims that the reason behind human rights violations and poverty in the region is due to the Indian government
A few weeks later Amar describes his encounter with the woman over the radio which she hears
He again spots her at a post office
He follows her and tells her that he is in love with her
She tells Amar she is married
Amar wishes to apologize but she arrives with two men who beat him unconscious
Amar learns that she lied about being married
He reaches her home and learns that she left
He bribes the PCO owner at the post office into giving him her contact information and learns that she is telephoning to Ladakh
He travels to Leh and while recording the Sindhu Darshan Festival a suicide bomber is chased to death by the military
Amar spots the woman again boarding a bus
While he tells the military that he is reporting on the festival the woman uses Amar to her advantage telling the military that he is her husband
The bus breaks down and the passengers are required to walk to the nearby village
Amar forces the woman to reveal her name Meghna
The two travel together but the next day Amar wakes to find Meghna gone
Amar returns home to Delhi where his family has found a potential bride for him in Preeti Nair
Amar agrees to marry Preeti because he does not hope to meet Meghna again
On his date with Preeti he spots one of Meghna s associates Kim
Amar chases him down to Connaught Place where the man runs into police and kills himself with cyanide
The police relinquish the situation to the CBI
Meghna is also in Delhi and requests Amar to help her get employment at Amar s office

Based on eyewitness claims Amar is now a suspect of the CBI
Amar questions Meghna s motives and she reveals to Amar that her name is actually Moina
As a child she had been a rape victim of the army and seeks liberation through her suicide attack on them
Amar is again assaulted by Moina s associate and the terrorists
As he fights back the terrorists receive a call from Moina
Amar grabs the phone and pleads with Moina to stop all this and marry him
Moina says it is too late and presumes Amar is being killed
The CBI misconstrue that Amar is part of the terrorist group and arrest him when he comes home
They reject his claims of innocence and sedate him
The next day Moina is ready for the suicide attack
Amar escapes from the CBI and tries to hold her back expressing his love and pleading her to live with him
As they embrace the explosive vest Moina wears explodes killing them both

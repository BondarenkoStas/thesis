The protagonists are two freewheeling bikers Wyatt nicknamed Captain America and Billy
Wyatt dresses in American flag adorned leather while Billy dresses in Native American style buckskin pants and shirts and a bushman hat
The former is quite open to people they meet on their journey and accepting of help while the latter is more hostile and suspicious
After smuggling cocaine from Mexico to Los Angeles Wyatt and Billy sell their haul to Connection a man in a Rolls Royce and receive a large sum in return
With the money stuffed into a plastic tube hidden inside the Stars Stripes painted fuel tank of Wyatt s California style chopper they ride eastward aiming to reach New Orleans Louisiana in time for the Mardi Gras festival
During their trip Wyatt and Billy stop to repair one of the bikes at a farmstead and have a meal with the farmer and his family
Wyatt seems to appreciate the simple traditional lifestyle presented here
Later Wyatt stops to pick up a hippyish hitch hiker and he invites them to visit his commune where they stay for the rest of the day
Life in the commune appears to be hard with young hippies from the city struggling to grow their own crops in a dry climate with poor soil and little rainfall
At one point the bikers witness a prayer for blessing of the new crop as put by a commune member A chance to make a stand and to plant simple food for our simple taste
The commune is also hosting a traveling theater group that sings for its supper
The notion of free love appears to be practised with two of the women Lisa and Sarah seemingly sharing the affections of the hitch hiking commune member before turning their attention to Wyatt and Billy
The hitch hiker asks the two bikers to stay at the commune saying the time is now to which Wyatt replies I m hip about time but I just gotta go
As the bikers leave the hitch hiker gives Wyatt some LSD for him to share with the right people
Later while naughtily riding along with a parade in a small town the pair are arrested by the local authorities for parading without a permit and thrown in jail
There they befriend American Civil Liberties Union lawyer and local drunk George Hanson who has spent the night in jail after overindulging in alcohol
George helps them get out of jail and decides to travel with Wyatt and Billy to New Orleans
As they camp that night Wyatt and Billy introduce George to marijuana
As an alcoholic and a square George is reluctant to try the marijuana but he quickly relents
Stopping to eat at a smalltown Louisiana diner the trio s appearance attracts the attention of the locals
The girls in the restaurant think they re exciting but the local men and a police officer begin making loud and denigrating comments and taunts
One of the men menacingly states I don t believe they ll make the parish line
The waitress does not take their order and Wyatt Billy and George feeling the hostility decide to leave without any fuss
They make camp outside town
The events of the day cause George to comment This used to be a hell of a good country
I can t understand what s gone wrong with it
He observes that Americans talk a lot about the value of freedom but are actually afraid of anyone who truly exhibits it
In the middle of the night a group of locals attack the sleeping trio beating them with clubs
Billy screams and brandishes a knife and the attackers leave
Wyatt and Billy suffer minor injuries but George has been bludgeoned to death
Wyatt and Billy wrap George s body up in his sleeping bag gather his belongings and vow to return the items to his parents
They continue to New Orleans and find a brothel George had told them about
Taking prostitutes Karen and Mary with them Wyatt and Billy decide to go outside and wander the parade filled street of the Mardi Gras celebration
They end up in a cemetery where all four ingest the LSD which the hitch hiker had given to Wyatt
They experience a bad trip
Making camp afterward Billy declares that their trek has been a success
Wyatt disagrees declaring We blew it
The next morning the two are continuing their trip eastward to Florida when two rednecks in an old pickup truck spot them and decide to scare the hell out of them with their shotgun
As they pull alongside Billy one of the men lazily aims the shotgun at him and threatens and insults him by saying Want me to blow your brains out
and Why don t you get a haircut
When Billy casually flips his middle finger up at them the hillbilly fires the shotgun and the shot hits Billy
His motorcycle goes down and he lands near the edge of the road seriously wounded in the side
As the truck then takes off past Wyatt down the road Wyatt turns around and races back to put his American flag emblazoned jacket over his critically injured friend who is already drenched in blood before riding off for help
Seeing the injured biker the old pickup truck turns around and closes in on Wyatt
The hillbilly fires at Wyatt as he speeds by killing Wyatt instantly his motorcycle goes flying in flames
As the murderous rednecks drive away the film ends with an aerial shot from a helicopter of the flaming bike in the middle of the deserted road and two bikers lying there as the camera recedes into the sky

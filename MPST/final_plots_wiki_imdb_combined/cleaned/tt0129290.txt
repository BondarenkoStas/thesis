A suicidal Hunter Patch Adams commits himself into a mental institution
Once there he finds that using humor as opposed to the indifferent sessions provided by their doctor to help his fellow patients gives him a purpose in life
Because of this he wants to become a medical doctor and two years later enrolls at the Medical College of Virginia as the oldest first year student
He questions the school s soulless approach to medical care and clashes with the school s Dean Walcott who believes that doctors must treat patients as patients and not bond with them as people
Because of this and incidents such as setting up a giant pair of legs during an obstetric conference he is expelled from the medical school although he is later reinstated due to his methods actually helping patients improve
Adams encourages medical students to work closely with nurses learn interviewing skills early and argues that death should be treated with dignity and sometimes even humor
Adams begins a friendship with fellow student Carin Fisher and develops his idea for a medical clinic built around his philosophy of treating patients using humor and compassion
With the help of Arthur Mendelson a wealthy man who was a patient whom Patch met while in the mental hospital he purchases 105 acres in West Virginia to construct the future Gesundheit
Institute
Together with Carin medical student Truman Schiff and some old friends he renovates an old cottage into a clinic
When they get the clinic running they treat patients without medical insurance and perform comedy sketches for them
Carin and Patch s friendship soon turns into romance
When she tells him that she had been molested as a child Patch comforts her and reassures her that she can overcome her pain by helping others
Encouraged Carin wants to help a disturbed patient Lawrence Larry Silver
However Larry murders Carin then commits suicide
Patch is devastated and guilt ridden by Carin s death and begins to question the goodness in humanity
Standing on a cliff he contemplates suicide once again and questions God about what happened
He then sees a butterfly which reminds him of Carin s telling him earlier how she always wished she was a caterpillar that could someday transform itself and fly away
The butterfly lands on his medical bag and on his shirt before flying away
This reminds Patch of Carin and revives his spirits and he decides to continue his work in her honor
He is expelled from medical school a second time for running a clinic and practicing medicine without a license and because of complaints that he has made his patients uncomfortable
He files a grievance with the state medical board at the advice of his former medical school roommate uptight Mitch Roman
Patch is able to convince the board that he did his best to help the people that came to him and as a doctor it is his responsibility to treat the spirit as well as the body
The board accepts Patch s methods and decides to allow him to graduate
He receives a standing ovation from the packed hearing room
At graduation Patch receives his diploma and bows to the professors and the audience revealing that he is not wearing anything under his gown

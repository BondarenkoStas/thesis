In 2020 ecological disaster has driven the wealthy to an underground city
Jason Storm is part of an elite security force called the Tracker Communicators who protect the city against the surface world survivors who could not afford to escape
Zoey Kinsella the deceased founder s daughter joins him as his rookie partner
After a raid by starving surface world survivors breaches the city s force field Zoey comes to believe they have inside help
Storm acknowledges the possibility but is more concerned with his clashes against the Controller the leader of the city s security and his enforcer Bigalow
The Controller wants to use a cybernetic project to replace the Tracker Communicators but he can not find any volunteers Niki Picasso and his gang penetrate the underground city s force field and head directly to a disused area of the city
There in a hidden cache they find ammunition and an automatic rifle a weapon that has become extremely rare
While Picasso pins down Storm and Kinsella an unseen adversary shoots Kinsella dead
Convinced of a coverup Storm angrily resigns only to have the Controller send Bigalow to kill him
When Storm escapes the city the Controller frames him for Kinsella s death and sets the security forces after him
Unknown to Storm the Controller has Kinsella resurrected as a cyborg and programs her to be his personal assassin
Her first mission is to seduce Picasso and recruit him to take over a research facility guarded by the Lifers a powerful gang
On the surface world Storm encounters a martial arts master Sumai and his daughter
Sumai helps Storm infiltrate Picasso s lair but the cybernetic Kinsella easily defeats Storm
As Storm recovers Sumai trains him
Sumai former head of security at the research facility tells Storm that Kinsella s father was the person who founded it
The facility was originally meant to counter the ecological damage but was converted into a chemical weapons factory
Suspecting that the Controller seeks the biological weapons to take over the surface world Storm and Sumai recruit fighters who are willing to stand up to Picasso
As Picasso overpowers the Lifers with his rifle the Controller murders the city s leader the Overlord and joins him
After launching the chemical weapons the Controller double crosses Picasso
As the Controller flees the facility Picasso confronts and kills him though he left trapped in a silo
The chemicals though currently inert will kill every surface dweller unless a countdown is aborted
After defeating Bigalow and his men Storm and Sumai break into the control room where the Controller has left Kinsella
Storm helps her to remember her true self and she guesses several passwords
Finally with time running out Sumai guesses the correct password and saves the surface world
Picasso calls for help when they ignore him he vows revenge

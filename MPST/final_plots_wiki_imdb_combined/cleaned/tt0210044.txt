Novel The novel opens with an epigraph taken from Book VII of Plato s The Republic Anyone who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eye are of two kinds and arise from two causes either from coming out of the light or from going into the light which is true of the mind s eye quite as much as of the bodily eye

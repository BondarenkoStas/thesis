Leona Stevenson is the spoiled bedridden daughter of wealthy businessman James Cotterell
One day while listening to what seems to be a crossed telephone connection she hears two men planning a woman s murder
The call cuts off without Leona learning very much other than it is scheduled for 11 15 when a passing train will hide any sounds
She calls the telephone company and the police but with few concrete details they can do nothing
Complicating matters her husband Henry is overdue and their servants have the night off leaving her all alone in a Manhattan apartment
As she makes a number of phone calls trying to locate Henry Leona inadvertently begins to piece together the mystery
The story is told mostly in flashbacks
When Leona reaches Henry s secretary Elizabeth Jennings she learns that he took an attractive Mrs Lord to lunch and did not return to the office
Mrs Lord turns out to be the former Sally Hunt
Leona stole then drug store employee Henry from Sally and married him against her father s wishes
Sally is now the wife of Fred Lord a lawyer in the district attorney s office
From overheard conversations she learned that her husband was close to resolving an investigation that involves Henry somehow
Sally became so concerned that she followed her husband and two associates to a mysterious meeting in a seemingly abandoned house on Staten Island
The house according to a no trespassing sign belongs to a W Evans
Sally arranged to meet Henry for lunch but before she could warn him he left the table and did not return
Later Sally calls Leona with more news
The house on Staten Island has burned down and three men including someone named Morano have been arrested
Waldo Evans however has escaped
Leona then receives a message from Henry stating he has gone out of town on business he had forgotten about and will not be back until Sunday
Leona next gets in touch with Dr Alexander a specialist she had come to New York to see regarding her lifelong heart troubles
Alexander reveals that he gave Henry her prognosis 10 days before something that Henry kept from her
Henry had married Leona without being aware of her health problems
He first found out when she had a heart attack after they quarreled about his attempt to get a job on his own rather than being a do nothing vice president in his father in law s business
Her attacks became more and more frequent until she finally took to her bed about a year ago
Alexander however diagnosed Leona s problems as purely psychosomatic nothing is wrong with her physically
Leona has got into hysterics and phones a hospital asking to hire a nurse for the night
The receptionist tells her that they are short staffed and she can only have a nurse if the doctor feels it isn t an emergency
She thinks it is only 11 00pm but discovers her clock has stopped sending her into worse hysterics
Then Leona receives a telephone call from Waldo Evans a chemist working for her father
He reluctantly discloses that Henry recruited him to steal valuable chemicals from the Cotterell drug company to sell to Morano
Later Henry decided to bypass Morano when Evans was transferred to the New Jersey plant
Morano however showed up with two thugs and intimidated Henry into signing an IOU for 200 000 for his lost profits due in three months
When Henry protested that he did not have that much money Morano pointed out that Leona must have a large insurance policy
However with Morano now in custody Evans stresses that Henry no longer has to raise the now overdue sum
Waldo leaves Leona with a telephone number to call to locate Henry but when she calls the number she discovers to her horror that it is for the city morgue
When Henry finally calls from a train station in New Haven Connecticut Leona gives him Evans message
Seeing that it is only minutes from 11 15 he pleads with her to go to the balcony and scream for help but she protests that she cannot though she can hear somebody downstairs
When the intruder enters her bedroom she begs for her life then screams
The intruder strangles and kills Leona
Unaware of the policemen about to apprehend him Henry frantically calls back only to have a man answer Sorry wrong number

The film begins in 1658 when the French actor and playwright returns to Paris with his theatrical troupe to perform in the theatre the king s brother has given him
Most of the film is in the form of a flashback to 1645
Following an unsuccessful run as a tragic actor Molière is released from debtor s prison by Monsieur Jourdain a wealthy commoner with social pretensions who agrees to pay the young actor s debts if Molière teaches him to act
Jourdain a married man with two daughters hopes to use this talent to ingratiate himself with Célimène a recently widowed aristocrat with whom he has become obsessed
He hopes to perform a short play he has written for the occasion
Molière however has been presented to the family and staff of Monsieur Jourdain as Tartuffe a priest who is to serve as tutor for the Jourdains younger daughter
As the story progresses Molière proceeds to fall in love with Jourdain s neglected wife Elmire
Sub plots involve the love life of the Jourdains older daughter and the intrigues of the penniless and cynical aristocrat Dorante at the expense of the gullible Jourdain
The story is mostly fictional and many scenes follow actual scenes and text in Molière s plays including Tartuffe Le Misanthrope The Imaginary Invalid and Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme whose principal character is also named Jourdain
It is implied that these actual events in his life inspired the plays of his maturity

In this Romeo and Juliet meets the Hatfields and McCoys short the film is set in the quiet hills of old Kaintucky where according to the introduction the hill folk live in peace and harmony
This description is immediately contradicted by a brief view of a chaotic battle
The short properly opens by featuring the front page of a newspaper the Ozark bazooka which reports that the leaders of the two rival clans have signed a non aggression pact
The geographic references to Kentucky and the Ozarks are mutually contradictory
The following scene introduces the two leads who start singing an idealistic song about how the fighting ends and about their new friendship
Or as Porky puts it Now we re pally wallies
The clan members seem to belong to multiple species many of their members being including chickens ducks and geese
Curiously Porky and Petunia are apparently the only pigs of either family
As the song continues side scenes reveal that the two leaders are being overly optimistic
Their fondness for each other is genuine but this is far from true for the other clan members
A black duck from the McCoy clan calmly observes to a white duck from the Martin clan that it is unbelievable that after all these years of shooting at each other their clans would end up friends
They both scream their conclusion that It ll never work
Elsewhere two ducks from the rival clans are dancing a graceful minuet but interrupt their dance to physically fight each other
Progressively people pretending to be friends are seen attempting to kill each other
Before long covert aggression between the two clans gives way to renewed hostilities
The entire countryside area is mobilized for war
Porky reacts by utilizing his secret weapon a Feud Pacifier
The device resembles hand grenade but is decorated with heart symbols pierced by arrows
He throws this Pacifier into the battlefield and somehow several of the combatants change to maypole dancers
Others are playing marbles or are embracing each other
The finale scenes resemble a pastoral romance

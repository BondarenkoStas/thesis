Misogynist freelance marine counter terrorism consultant Rufus Excalibur ffolkes is asked by Lloyd s of London to develop a contingency plan should any of the North Sea oil installations they insure be threatened
Months later Esther a North Sea supply ship takes on board a group of men posing as reporters who are visiting the oil production platform Jennifer
The leader of this group Lou Kramer along with his second in command Harold Shulman hijacks the ship and two scuba diving henchmen attach limpet mines to the legs of Jennifer and its oil drilling rig Ruth
From the bridge of Esther Kramer issues a ransom demand for 25 million or he will blow up Ruth then if the ransom is still not paid he will destroy Jennifer
For good measure he rigs Esther with explosives and has all the charges wired to a control panel that never leaves his side
Lord Privy Seal Dennis Tipping informs the British Prime Minister of the situation
The British government is opposed to yielding to terrorist blackmail but Tipping suggests that as a compromise Lloyd s could pay the ransom
After Lloyd s is consulted the Prime Minister is shown a video of ffolkes practising a rescue mission aboard a mock up ship
He has anticipated that terrorists might hijack a supply ship and has worked out a plan
Flying out to Jennifer ffolkes first proposes that to buy time a large explosion should light up the night sky fooling Kramer into thinking Ruth has exploded by accident so that he won t push the button at the deadline
ffolkes and Admiral Sir Francis Brindsen are to meet with Kramer on board Esther
ffolkes makes Brindsen practice accidentally dropping cigarettes on the floor the idea being that the admiral should distract Kramer giving ffolkes the opportunity to kill him before he sets off the bombs his team of commandos will in the meantime take out the guards posted on the vessel
A sub plot involves the imprisoned crew trying to poison their captors using the ship s medicine supply
A reporter who came with Kramer s men offers to do this but the crew quickly suspects him to be a plant so they tie him up
Unfortunately Kramer has been spying on them and when the food is delivered he forces one of the conspirators to drink the poisoned coffee Sanna the other main participant and the only woman on board flees and apparently falls overboard
Later Kramer demands that Brinston and King Jennifer s manager join him on Esther unintentionally going along with ffolkes plan
However Kramer doesn t trust ffolkes when he meets him and orders him to leave the ship
The reporter who got the blackmailers onto the ship gets cold feet and wants to leave so Kramer agrees to release him
At the last moment Kramer shoots him in the back as he is being winched aboard the helicopter
With time running out the Prime Minister considers paying the ransom but ffolkes replies angrily that that would send a message that anyone with a rowing boat and a stick of dynamite could hold this country to ransom
ffolkes still thinks he can rescue the hostages
However to save the lives of the 697 men and women aboard Jennifer ffolkes urges that Esther be obliterated with a bomb if his team cannot rescue the hostages in time
Ffolkes men storm Esther bringing down the guards
ffolkes joins them wearing a borrowed vermilion scuba suit but is forced to throw overboard his second in command who has mistaken him for a terrorist
Sanna who had been hiding in a lifeboat manages to take out one of the terrorists who tries to take a shot at ffolkes
ffolkes races for the bridge as the helicopter carrying the bomb approaches
At the appointed time Brindsen offers a cigarette to Kramer drops them on the floor and bends down to pick them up
ffolkes appears at the window and shoots the distracted Kramer with a spear gun pinning him to his chair
Seeing armed men running by Schulman races for the detonator switch but he gets impaled at the controls with a spear in each side
Just as the Royal Navy helicopter drops the bomb down its rear loading ramp ffolkes fires his signal flare into the sky the helicopter pilot desperately pulls away and the bomb narrowly misses Esther falling harmlessly into the sea
However Kramer isn t quite dead and he slowly reaches for the detonator
ffolkes pulls the wires out and watches him die
Before he slumps over Kramer s last words are I still don t like your face
A ceremony is held at ffolkes castle to celebrate the end of the hijack
Among those present are the former hostages the oil rig staff and the commandos
ffolkes has expressed his disdain for medals so the Prime Minister presents the cat loving eccentric with a new litter of kittens named Esther Ruth and Jennifer
For once moved and a little at a loss for words ffolkes leaves amidst a round of applause to give his new kittens a saucer of milk

One day he slips into an alternate world in which he drowned ten years before
Determined to find the truth behind the incident he follows a predestined course that leads him to save the world
He is assisted by Kid a feisty skilled thief who seeks the mythical Frozen Flame

Kid vows to find and defeat Lynx an anthropomorphic panther who burned down her adopted mother s orphanage
Lynx a cruel agent of the supercomputer FATE is bent on finding Serge and using his body as part of a greater plan involving the Frozen Flame
Lynx travels with Harle a mysterious playful girl dressed like a harlequin
Harle was sent by the Dragon God to shadow Lynx and one day steal the Frozen Flame from Chronopolis a task she painfully fulfills despite being smitten with Serge
To accomplish this goal Harle helps Lynx manipulate the Acacia Dragoons the powerful militia governing the islands of El Nido
As the Dragoons maintain order they contend with Fargo a former Dragoon turned pirate captain who holds a grudge against their leader General Viper
Though tussling with Serge initially the Acacia Dragoons whose ranks include the fierce warriors Karsh Zoah Marcy and Glenn later assist him when the militaristic nation of Porre invades the archipelago
The invasion brings Norris and Grobyc to the islands a heartful commander of an elite force and a prototype cyborg soldier respectively as they too seek the Frozen Flame
Story Chrono Cross begins with Serge located in El Nido a tropical archipelago inhabited by ancient natives mainland colonists and beings called Demi humans
Serge slips into an alternate dimension in which he drowned on the beach ten years prior and meets the thief Kid
As his adventure proceeds from here Serge is able to recruit a multitude of allies to his cause
While assisting Kid in a heist Viper Manor to steal the Frozen Flame he learns that ten years before the present the universe split into two dimensions one in which Serge lived and one in which he perished
Through Kid s Astral Amulet charm Serge travels between the dimensions
At Fort Dragonia the use of a Dragonian artifact called the Dragon Tear Lynx switches bodies with Serge
Unaware of the switch Kid confides in Lynx who stabs her as the real Serge helplessly watches
Lynx boasts of his victory and banishes Serge to a strange realm called the Temporal Vortex
He takes Kid under his wing brainwashing her to believe the real Serge is her enemy
Serge escapes with help from Harle although his new body turns him into a stranger in his own world with all the allies he had gained up to that point abandoning him due to his new appearance
Discovering that his new body prevents him from traveling across the dimensions he sets out to regain his former body and learn more of the universal split that occurred ten years earlier gaining a new band of allies along the way
He travels to a forbidden lagoon known as the Dead Sea a wasteland frozen in time dotted with futuristic ruins
At the center he locates a man named Miguel and presumably Home world s Frozen Flame
Charged with guarding the Dead Sea by an entity named FATE Miguel and three visions of Crono Marle and Lucca from Chrono Trigger explain that Serge s existence dooms Home world s future to destruction at the hands of Lavos
To prevent Serge from obtaining the Frozen Flame FATE destroys the Dead Sea
Able to return to Another world Serge allies with the Acacia Dragoons against Porre and locates that dimension s Dragon Tear allowing him to return to his human form
He then enters the Sea of Eden Another world s physical equivalent of the Dead Sea finding a temporal research facility from the distant future called Chronopolis
Lynx and Kid are inside Serge defeats Lynx and the supercomputer FATE allowing the six Dragons of El Nido to steal the Frozen Flame and retire to Terra Tower a massive structure raised from the sea floor
Kid falls into a coma and Harle bids the party goodbye to fly with the Dragons
Serge regroups his party and tends to Kid who remains comatose
Continuing his adventure he obtains and cleanses the corrupted Masamune sword from Chrono Trigger
He then uses the Dragon relics and shards of the Dragon Tears to create the mythic Element Chrono Cross
The spiritual power of the Masamune later allows him to lift Kid from her coma
At Terra Tower the prophet of time revealed to be Belthasar from Chrono Trigger visits him with visions of Crono Marle and Lucca
Serge learns that the time research facility Chronopolis created El Nido thousands of years ago after a catastrophic experimental failure drew it to the past
The introduction of a temporally foreign object in history caused the planet to pull in a counterbalance from a different dimension
This was Dinopolis a city of Dragonians parallel universe descendants of Chrono Trigger s Reptites
The institutions warred and Chronopolis subjugated the Dragonians
Humans captured their chief creation the Dragon God an entity capable of controlling nature
Chronopolis divided this entity into six pieces and created an Elements system
FATE then terraformed an archipelago erased the memories of most Chronopolis s staff and sent them to inhabit and populate its new paradise
Thousands of years later a panther demon attacked a three year old Serge
His father took him to find assistance at Marbule but Serge s boat blew off course due to a raging magnetic storm caused by Schala
Schala the princess of the Kingdom of Zeal had long ago accidentally fallen to a place known as the Darkness Beyond Time and began merging with Lavos the chief antagonist of Chrono Trigger
Schala s storm nullified Chronopolis s defenses and allowed Serge to contact the Frozen Flame approaching it healed Serge but corrupted his father
A circuit in Chronopolis then designated Serge Arbiter simultaneously preventing FATE from using the Frozen Flame by extension
The Dragons were aware of this situation creating a seventh Dragon under the storm s cover named Harle who manipulated Lynx to steal the Frozen Flame for the Dragons
After Serge returned home FATE sent Lynx to kill Serge hoping that it would release the Arbiter lock
Ten years after Serge drowned the thief Kid presumably on Belthasar s orders went back in time to save Serge and split the dimensions
FATE locked out of the Frozen Flame again knew that Serge would one day cross to Another world and prepared to apprehend him
Lynx switched bodies with Serge to dupe the biological check of Chronopolis on the Frozen Flame
Belthasar then reveals that these events were part of a plan he had orchestrated named Project Kid
Serge continues to the top of Terra Tower and defeats the Dragon God
Continuing to the beach where the split in dimensions had occurred Serge finds apparitions of Crono Marle and Lucca once more
They reveal that Belthasar s plan was to empower Serge to free Schala from melding with Lavos lest they evolve into the Time Devourer a creature capable of destroying spacetime
Lucca explains that Kid is Schala s clone sent to the modern age to take part in Project Kid
Serge uses a Time Egg given to him by Belthasar to enter the Darkness Beyond Time and vanquish the Time Devourer separating Schala from Lavos and restores the dimensions to one
Thankful Schala muses on evolution and the struggle of life and returns Serge to his home noting that he will forget the entire adventure
She then seemingly records the experience in her diary noting she will always be searching for Serge in this life and beyond signing the entry as Schala Kid Zeal implying that she and kid have merged and became whole again
A wedding photo of Kid and an obscured male sits on the diary s desk
Scenes then depict a real life Kid searching for someone in a modern city intending to make players entertain the possibility that their own Kid is searching for them
The ambiguous ending leaves the events of the characters lives following the game up to interpretation
Relation to Radical Dreamers Chrono Cross employs story arcs characters and themes from Radical Dreamers a Satellaview side story to Chrono Trigger released in Japan
An illustrated text adventure Radical Dreamers was created to wrap up an unresolved plot line of Chrono Trigger
Though it borrows from Radical Dreamers in its exposition Chrono Cross is not a remake of Radical Dreamers but a larger effort to fulfill that game s purpose the plots of the games are irreconcilable
To resolve continuity issues and acknowledge Radical Dreamers the developers of Chrono Cross suggested the game happened in a parallel dimension
A notable difference between the two games is that Magus present in Radical Dreamers as Gil is absent from Chrono Cross
Director Masato Kato originally planned for Magus to appear in disguise as Guile but scrapped the idea due to plot difficulties
In the DS version of Chrono Trigger Kato teases the possibility of an amnesiac Magus

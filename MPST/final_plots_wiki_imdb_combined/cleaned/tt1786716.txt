Background The game is presented against the background of the history of the One Ring
At the dawn of the Second Age after the defeat of the Dark Lord Morgoth the elves of Eregion forged the nineteen Rings of Power to help themselves the dwarves and men rule Middle earth
However the elves were unaware that Sauron Morgoth s closest ally had survived his master s defeat and in the guise of Annatar had been the one who taught the Elven smiths led by Celebrimbor how to forge the Rings whilst in secret he forged his own One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom a Ring far more powerful than any of the others
However in order for the One Ring to be powerful enough to control the other Rings Sauron had to transfer most of his power into it
As soon as he put it on the elves became aware of his ruse removing and hiding their Three Rings which Celebrimbor had forged without Sauron s aid
Sauron waged war on the elves conquering much of Middle earth and killing Celebrimbor
Thus began the Dark Years when Sauron took possession of the remaining sixteen Rings giving seven to the dwarves and nine to men in an effort to corrupt them
The dwarves proved relatively immune to the powers of the Rings acquiring only a greed for gold and becoming unconcerned with events in the wider world
Men proved less resilient and the nine kings given the Rings become the nine Ring wraiths or Nazgûl led by the Witch king of Angmar
In his ongoing efforts to conquer Middle earth Sauron regained the allegiance of many of Morgoth s servants from the First Age and successfully corrupted Númenor
However in doing so he expended a great deal of his power and lost the ability to ever again assume a pleasing disguise
Returning to Mordor he regained his strength eventually capturing Minas Ithil
However realizing that if they did not join together Sauron would destroy both men and elves Elendil High King of Arnor and Gil galad High King of Noldor formed the Last Alliance of Men and Elves and attacked Sauron in his fortress Barad dûr
The alliance was victorious with Isildur cutting the One Ring from Sauron s hand
However although presented with a chance to destroy the Ring forever Isildur already beginning to succumb to its corruption chose not to do so
As such although Sauron s physical form was vanquished his spirit bound to the Ring survived
Some time later Isildur was attacked and killed by a band of orcs and the Ring was lost in the river Anduin for over two thousand years
Meanwhile during the Third Age a still weakened Sauron covertly established a stronghold at Dol Guldur
In response to this undetermined evil the Valar sent five Maiar to Middle earth
Taking the form of wizards they were led by Saruman
Unsure of the origin of the evil power in Dol Guldur the wizard Gandalf was sent to investigate
However Sauron hid from Gandalf waiting for four hundred years before returning
Around the same time the One Ring was found by a Hobbit named Sméagol who became utterly corrupted by it living in the caves of the Misty Mountains and physically transforming into a creature known as Gollum
For five hundred years Gollum was consumed and corrupted by the Ring
Eventually Gandalf was able to determine the evil presence in Dol Guldur was indeed Sauron
Gandalf reported back to the White Council but Saruman dissuaded them from moving against Sauron
Only when he learned the One Ring may be in the vicinity of the Gladden Fields did Saruman agree to attack Sauron hoping to find the Ring himself
The Council drove Sauron from Dol Guldur unaware that he knew the Ring had been found
Just prior to Sauron s departure the Ring passed to another hobbit Bilbo Baggins who used it to assist in the victory of elves men and dwarves at the Battle of the Five Armies
Sixty years later Gollum was captured by orcs and taken to Mordor where he was tortured into revealing the owner and location of the Ring Bilbo Baggins of the Shire
In the meantime Bilbo had left the Shire to live in Rivendell and upon the advice of Gandalf had given the Ring to his nephew Frodo Baggins
With the information given him by Gollum Sauron still unable to take physical form thus sent the Nazgûl to the Shire to retrieve the One Ring
Frodo and his friends Samwise Gamgee Peregrin Pippin Took and Meriadoc Merry Brandybuck managed to escape the Shire and head towards Bree

Tuesday night brings a whopping three hours of America s Got Talent including the final hour of auditions and a two hour run through the Vegas round First 8 year old Avery and the Calico Hearts a singing trio pile on the saccharin with a rendition of Justin Bieber s Baby
The judges all enjoy it even Piers but he doesn t want to send them through
Sharon and Howie s votes are good enough to keep the sweetness coming
They re going to Hollywood A guy named Kevin Shelley says he s going to break 48 1 inch thick pieces of wood with his head
He asks Nick to hand them to him one at a time and the guy does it alarming fast
His head bleeds a bit but he seems to have all his faculties
A medic stands by just in case telling Nick That s not right
Piers says that whenever people ask him what it s like to work with Howie Mandel he s going to show them the video of what Kevin just did
Howie wants Kevin to come back and do something even more dangerous
It s a yes
Sharon says she can t see it in Vegas and it s a no
Piers agrees with Howie
Kevin s in and leaves with an ice pack on his forehead Here comes the montage Dezmond Meeks a singer and pianist riles the crowd with an old sweet rendition of Georgia on My Mind a juggler named Thomas John plays When the Saints Go Marching In with a ping pong ball and yeah this one you had to see and a female singing quartet called 4Play stuns the judges and crowd with a version of Beyonce s If I Were a Boy J
Chris Newberg plays short funny songs
Piers doesn t find him particularly funny
Howie thinks he s a funny guy
Piers says he s great except he s not funny
Howie s a yes Piers is a no and Sharon is a yes King Diamond is a 61 year old blast from the past who looks like he just landed out of an episode of Shaft
He wants to entertain the world
It takes everyone a moment to figure out whether he s good or terrible
But once the it s clear he s terrible he gets three X s quickly
Nick comes on stage to dance with King Diamond to smooth it all over CUT is led by a man who says the group s mission is to keep kids out of trouble
One of the girls who talks about how her coach is a mentor and father figure tears up as she tells the story
The girl becomes the focal point as her teammates are supposed to do flips over her off a small trampoline and one of them jumps right into her
She s knocked sideways and gets up to get back in position and goes even higher
The rest of the act is completed without incident
Piers tells her it was just about the bravest thing he s ever seen
Howie wants to see it less raw and more polished but votes yes
Piers loves them raw and sends them to Vegas A guy who Howie says looks like Art Garfunkel goes on stage wearing nothing but a robe
He immediately threatens to disrobe
He eventually does after pulling off a series of boxers and briefs
The crowd watches in amazement and disgust
All three judges dismiss the rather cheesy act A montage of terrible acts including a really bad opera singer a guy who tells stories with balloons and an awful 55 year old pop singer follows A couple of old pals 67 and 81 who met singing karaoke take the stage promising to show something we ve never seen
The show is called Meet Me at Fairfax and Third
The 81 year old plays piano and croons while his 67 year old pal randomly does a headstand on a wooden chair and dances upside down to the music
The music is drowned out by the crowd s cheers
Piers calls it utterly ludicrous but that there s something horribly good about them
Howie loves it saying that sometimes A and B are nothing individually but together this is what you get
That s it for the Season 6 auditions SECOND PARTThe judges are on their way to Vegas or at least in a fancy tour bus going from the airport to the place where the auditions are being held
They have to decide who will perform on Day 1 who will wait for Day 2 and who will go home right away
There will be 48 spots in the next round The judges welcome all the acts to Vegas
Piers asks 10 of them to stand up
He says the judges have agreed to send them home immediately because they ve decided to put them straight through to Hollywood They are Silhouettes Squawk Opera Lys Agnes Professor Splash The Rhinestone Ropers The Fearless Flores Family Melissa Villasenor Captain Stab Tuggo and Maybelle Team ILuminate Miami All Stars The remaining 38 spots will be determined in Vegas
The first day will feature the judges favorite acts
They will have the first chance to make it to the next round
The rest of the acts are considered standbys and will only get a chance to make it if the favorites don t fill up the 38 spots The acts are grouped together and first up is the Danger group Juggler Charles Peachock ups the stakes introducing fire to his act going so far as to light his legs on fire while he juggles torches that are also ablaze The judges are impressed
Next is Kevin Shelley who broke all those boards over his head in Atlanta
This time he s breaking concrete with his elbows and standing on swords while an assistant breaks concrete blocks on his back
But the blocks don t break
The Yellow Design Stunt Team a group of bike performers try to impress the judges
Frank Miles who juggled stun guns puts a knife into one of four styrofoam coolers
Then asking Sharon to choose a cooler at random he eliminates the coolers that don t have the knife in them by doing forward flips and breaking the coolers with his weight He nails it holding a fake bloody knife tip to his stomach for effect as he breaks the very last empty cooler The next category is vocal groups
Mona Lisa give it their all and 4Play are shocked with their own performance
They tells the judges the nerves got to them
The judges confer and send them home immediately Next are the acrobats
Trapeze artists tumblers and jump ropers go at it and a couple of pole dancers a man and a woman fill out the group
Steven Retchless the male pole dancer wows the judges with an even better performance than he showed in the auditions
Soleil Rousseau the woman says she wants to prove that pole dancing is OK to do
She cries as she explains that her parents likely don t approve but support her despite that
Howie asks her how she thought she compared to the other pole dancer
She says hers was more graceful and his was mostly strength
Next are the magicians
They re carefully watching each other
Fantastic Fig 76 is back and the others are watching
Another magician says Figs card tricks aren t real magic
Michael Turco who s been watching and knocking the others runs into trouble with his illusion when a door gets stuck The animal acts stumble too when some a dog has trouble jumping rope
The talking parrots face off
But this time they both struggle
Echo doesn t want to speak and doesn t even wave bye bye
His owner quips that they aren t going to get bye bye and Howie suggests otherwise
Meanwhile Vegas Birds has a parrot that paints or at least they think it does
Sharon asks the bird to paint a rose and the painting looks nothing like a rose
Backstage Echo says I don t like it
I m going to fly
The classical singers are next and Landau Eugene Murphy Jr is nervous because he isn t classically trained like his competitors
Cindy Chang is helping keep his nerves in check backstage
Cindy s audition doesn t go as well
She seems quite nervous and shaky
Howie says he didn t like it and Piers agrees it was a little bit off
The judges send her home immediately and we have to listen to Coldplay just in case we don t feel bad enough for her
Landau is devastated but he won t try to fix her The next group is the bands
The Fiddleheads are the first of the bands to really capture the judges attention
Pop Lyte are the youngest band in the category
They promised to win Piers over with an electric set
The judges agree that they did step it up from the first audition The dance acts are next and Fatally Unique
Their human pyramid fell during rehearsal and one of the dancers was taken away in an ambulance with her neck stabilized
Another injured dancer is part of LD Dance who has a severely twisted ankle
She goes on despite being in pain
Snap Boogie who s been watching the other dances in awe says he wishes he could do all that stuff
He s a street dancer and he shows the judges what he does best
Piers and Sharon love it
Fatally Unique s injured dancer comes back with a busted lip and fractured nose
They ve altered the routine just enough to take the injured dancer out of the final stunt The female singers are next
Dani Shay the Justin Bieber look alike is nervous going up against great singers
She s going to do an original song which Piers calls a massive risk
She stumbles halfway through her song and stops
She doesn t continue after stopping
The judges call her back as they ve done with the acts that they ve sent home immediately
Sharon tells her that they need to hear her sing a well known song
Asked if she s willing to do that Dani says OK The comedians go next and they have trouble performing to a 7 000 seat arena that s empty but for three judge
J Chris Newberg the guy who sings short funny songs does alright
Gichi Guy does his one liner thing Dani Shay is ready to come back and perform Trouble for the judges which she says she just learned in a couple of hours The novelty acts who acknowledge they re just weirdos include a drag queen who butchers a Tina Turner song
Those Funny Little People the dancing gnomes do a new routine with a female gnome in the mix
Piers seems to hate it and so Howie has them come down to the judges table so he can get a picture with the gnomes standing around an annoyed Piers
The Kinetic King works up an elaborate domino like set up with popsicle sticks and who knows what else which took about six to eight hours to build and amazes the judges The male singers bring their different styles looks and sounds to the competition
Ryan Andreas wants it badly and seems to have his nerves more under control but later says he s not super happy with this performance
Dezmond Meeks who s made a life out of random singing gigs is hoping this one sticks There s massive drama as the judges discuss all the acts and try to figure out who should stay and who should go Coldplay s back which means there s some bad news coming

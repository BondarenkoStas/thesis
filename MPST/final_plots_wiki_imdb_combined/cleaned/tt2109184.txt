On October 9 2006 Kristi Rey and her husband Daniel are killed by her demon possessed sister Katie who then abducts Kristi s one year old son Hunter
Text states that Katie and Hunter s whereabouts remained unknown
Now 5 years later in November 2011 Alex Nelson lives in suburban Henderson Nevada with her father Doug mother Holly and little brother Wyatt
Alex and her boyfriend Ben discover their new neighbor s son Robbie hiding in their family tree house
The next day Robbie s mother falls ill and is taken to the hospital leaving Robbie in the care of the family
As Robbie is unpacking his stuff he says that his teddy bear is 100 years old
Also he has a 100 year old fork
Alex is skyping with her boyfriend Ben when she hears the front door open
When she leaves the web cam in the room Robbie darts past the screen
One night while Alex is sleeping Ben s computer starts recording and he sees Robbie getting into the bed with her
The next day she goes to the kid s playhouse and Wyatt starts telling her about Toby Robbie s friend
They turn their Xbox Kinect system and Alex films herself with it
When Alex talks to Robbie behind him there s a green blur that rushes past the screen
The next day Alex shows her dad but he thinks it s a joke
Alex and Ben set up cameras all over the house
On night 3 Robbie and Wyatt are running through the house like maniacs
The next day Alex is in the kitchen making a sandwich and a basketball starts dribbling down the stairs
While in her bedroom she starts hearing strange noises and a loud bang from downstairs
When Alex investigates she finds a trail of toys that leads to a closet
Suddenly a toy train turns on behind her and spooks Alex
She finds Robbie who runs away from her saying He does not like you filming us as a chandelier falls and almost kills her
On night 6 Alex sees a lot of cars parked outside Robbie s house and goes to check it out but runs back home after being caught by a strange woman in a black gown
The next day while Wyatt is playing in the house chairs start moving by themselves and stop him in his tracks
Wyatt pushes his bike off screen only for it to appear to be pushed by invisible force back to him
Alex and Ben are in the living room when the hear a very loud thud from upstairs
When they go to the boy s closet Wyatt reveals a green symbol on his back and tells them I had to meet him
Alex and Ben learn the symbol is from a witches coven one that would unleash a demon to possess a young boy
They read further to learn to complete the possession ritual Wyatt would need to spill the blood of a virgin
Ben jokes with Alex about her virginity to spook her
The next day the boys suddenly leave and go to Robbie s house
Alex follows the boys there where Katie presumably Robbie s mother has returned from the hospital appearing well and normal
In the next scene while Holly is in the kitchen cutting vegetables the knife she was using vanishes into thin air
Later Wyatt explains to Alex that Katie knew that Robbie and he were both adopted and that Wyatt s real name is Hunter
Katie told Wyatt his old family wants him back
The next night Wyatt goes downstairs and argues with Toby saying My name s not Hunter
While Wyatt is taking a bath Holly goes downstairs for a few minutes
When Holly answers a phone call Wyatt gets pulled under the water by Toby
When he rises he appears to be in a trance
Later that night Holly gives Alex some sleeping pills because she s been having trouble sleeping
While Alex is asleep Wyatt makes the blanket fly off the bed and levitates her in mid air
On night 12 a possessed Katie is seen sneaking around and Alex s garage door starts opening and closing
Alex hears the garage door open so she goes to closes it
It mysteriously opens again and when Alex goes under it the door crashes down locking itself and almost kills her
During this Katie enters the house and goes upstairs to Wyatt s room where she tells him that she ll wait until he is ready
The family s car turns on by itself and begins spewing exhaust but Alex escapes by breaking into the car and crashing through the garage door
Alex attempts to show her parents the footage of this incident but the footage has been mysteriously erased
Alex tries explaining what happened but her parents think she s gone crazy
The next night Doug is downstairs watching TV on the couch and hears a creak in the kitchen
He investigates for a moment and seconds after he shuts down his computer and the knife that had vanished falls right in between him and the camera
This convinces Doug to believe Alex
Alex and Doug go to dinner to talk about the strange events
While they are gone Holly is violently thrown against the ceiling and drops to the floor dying upon impact
Katie drags her body away
Ben comes over goes inside and looks for Alex but no one is home
He hears a bang upstairs and attempts to leave a message on Alex s laptop
Katie appears suddenly and kills Ben by snapping his neck
Alex and Doug arrive home and Doug goes next door believing he saw Holly and Wyatt
As he goes to investigate Alex calls Ben s phone and hears it ringing in the closet
She finds Ben s body and is suddenly knocked down by a force presumably Toby
She flees to Katie s home and searches for Doug but cannot find him
Instead Alex finds Doug screaming being dragged down the hall and out of sight
She continues to search for Doug when she hears Wyatt s voice off screen
Suddenly Katie runs towards the camera shrieking like a demon
Alex escapes from Katie by jumping through a window and finds Wyatt in the yard
Wyatt refuses to leave and looks behind Alex
When Alex looks up she sees dozens of witches running towards her
As she turns around Katie lunges at her
The camera falls to the ground and the screen cuts to black

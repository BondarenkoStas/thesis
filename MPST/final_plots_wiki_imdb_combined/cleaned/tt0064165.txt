In the French countryside on a summer morning a lorry full of pigs stalls at a crossroads
An Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint swerves to avoid it and crashes into an orchard hurling the driver onto the grass
As he loses consciousness he revisits the essential things which made up his life
A Paris architect in his forties driving to a meeting at Rennes he had quarrelled with his lover Hélène the night before
They were due to leave together for a job he was offered in Tunis but he had not signed the documents
And he had agreed to take his teenage son Bertrand who lived with his estranged wife Catherine for a fortnight to the family s holiday home on the Île de Ré
Stopping at a café he wrote a letter to Hélène calling everything off but did not post it
Driving past a wedding he realised that the letter was quite wrong and he should in fact marry Hélène so giving a purpose to the rest of their lives
Rushed to hospital in Le Mans he does not recover and Catherine as his widow is given his effects including the unsent letter which she tears to pieces
Hélène arrives at the hospital and is told by a nurse that she is too late

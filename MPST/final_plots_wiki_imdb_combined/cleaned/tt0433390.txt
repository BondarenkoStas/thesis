The game begins with a flashback to an abandoned Baltimore amusement park where many people were killed in an accident caused by negligent maintenance of a Ferris wheel
The father of one of the victims contacts the Agency and orders a hit on the park owner Joseph Clarence
Agent 47 carries out the hit and following that assignment he receives a string of contracts from American clients eager to retain his services
The bulk of the game takes place as flashback sequences that occur concordant to the present day in which a journalist and the former FBI Director Jack Alexander Leland Cayne discuss 47 s hits over the past year and a half and his involvement in them
The reporter Rick Henderson arranged to interview Cayne concerning a recent attack on the White House but it quickly becomes clear that Cayne s real intent is to discuss 47
Cayne lies about many details such as stating that 47 stole cloning data from Ort Meyer to sell to the highest bidder or that 47 was working with a group of assassins known as the Franchise to kill the Secretary of the Interior
As the story progresses it is implied that the Agency s employees are being gradually assassinated by the Franchise
The situation degrades to the point where 47 s handler Diana Burnwood informs him that they are the only ones left
Eventually Diana shuts down the Agency and divides the remaining funds between them
After completing his final assignment 47 is approached by an old acquaintance CIA agent Carlton Smith who 47 had rescued earlier in the game
He offers 47 a high profile mission paid for using several million dollars worth of diamonds to prevent an assassination attempt on the president of the United States Tom Stewart
The assassins are Franchise operative Mark Parchezzi III and Vice President Daniel Morris both of whom are working for Alpha Zerox a shadowy political organization that seeks to monopolize the cloning technology used to create 47
As the President intends to legalize cloning ruining their plans the company hopes to replace him with the much more controllable Morris
47 successfully eliminates Morris and Parchezzi in the White House exposing the Franchise to the public
Hunted by the police 47 flees to his hideout
Without warning he is visited by Diana immediately arousing his suspicion
Diana proposes a plan to 47 to help them both escape
As 47 mulls over the briefing she hands him expressing his misgivings as to the likelihood of its success Diana injects him with what seems to be a fatal poison
47 s body is surrounded by SWAT officers and Diana announcing that killing 47 was surprisingly pleasant is formally inducted into the Franchise by Cayne its founder
The story then shifts to the present day 47 is scheduled for cremation so his bone marrow cannot be harnessed by cloning rivals forever destroying anyone else s chance of producing a non defective clone
Diana drapes 47 s custom pistols over his chest during his hasty funeral kisses him after applying fresh lipstick and leaves the funeral grounds
It becomes apparent that the poison she injected was actually a fake death serum 47 had used in an earlier mission with her lipstick containing the antidote
The funeral begins and the story then concludes in one of two different ways
In the first it is presumed the antidote fails to work and 47 is sent to the crematorium
In the second canonical ending the antidote is successful and 47 awakens slaughtering everyone in the church
With both Cayne and Henderson dead 47 s identity is kept secret
Sometime after the funeral bloodbath Diana uses the Franchise s assets to reopen the Agency in a building overlooking the Copenhagen harbor
She receives a call from a client she refers to as Your Majesty
The voice cannot be heard but Diana replies that the Agency has lost track of 47
Meanwhile 47 is seen at an unknown establishment engaging in conversation with a traditionally dressed Asian man
They discuss a service that can be found in the back
The story ends with the curtain literally closing on the two

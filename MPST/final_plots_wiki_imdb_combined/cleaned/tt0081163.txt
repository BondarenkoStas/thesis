Set in the fictional English village of St Mary Mead home of Miss Jane Marple in 1953
The movie opens with a black and white scene from a movie being played at the local community house titled Meeting at Midnight where a detective in the movie assembles a group of people together at a quait country mansion to root out them for the murder of the wealthy owner
The film breaks which depresses the local audience until Miss Marple reveals according to her natural skill of observation who the murderer in the movie is Meanwhile a big Hollywood production company arrives to film a costume movie about Mary Queen of Scots and Elizabeth I with two famous movie stars Marina Rudd and Lola Brewster
Marina and Lola are old rivals who hate each other
Marina who is making a much heralded comeback after a prolonged illness and retirement when she in reality has had a nervous breakdown and her husband Jason Rudd who is directing the movie they are making arrive with their entourage
When she learns that Lola will be in the movie as well she becomes enraged and vents her anger Lola and her husband Martin N Marty Fenn who is producing the movie they are making then arrive at the gathering
Excitement runs high in St Mary Mead as the locals have been invited to a reception held by the movie company in a manor house Gossington Hall to meet the celebrities
Lola and Marina come face to face at the reception and exchange some potent and comical insults nasty one liners as they smile and pose for the cameras
The two square off in a series of hilarious and cleverly written and performed cat fights throughout the movie After her initial exchange with Lola at the reception she is cornered by a gushing devoted fan Heather Babcock who bores her with a long and detailed story about having actually met Marina in person during World War II
After recounting the meeting they had all those years ago when she arose from her sickbed to go and meet the glamorous star Babcock drinks a cocktail that was made for Marina and quickly dies from poisoning
The incident is unfortunate for Marina s mental state and she is beside herself
Everyone is certain Heather was the intended murder victim
Once filming begins on the movie Marina discovers that apart from threatening notes made up of newspaper clippings her cup of coffee on the set has also been spiked with poison sending her into fits of terror A police detective from Scotland Yard arrives to investigate the case
Inspector Dermot Craddock is baffled as he tries to uncover who is behind the attempt on the life of the actress and the subsequent murder of the innocent woman
The suspected are Ella Zielinsky Jason s production assistant who is secretly having an affair with him and would like Marina out of the way and the hot headed actress Lola Brewster
Inspector Craddock even suspects Marty Fenn may have have something to do with the attempt on Marina s life since he is Lola s blindly loyal husband Inspector Craddock then meets with Marina who tells him about reciving the death threats against her in the form of two notes delivered recently and claims not to know who is behind them
When Inspector Craddock questions Jason about the notes he clearly acts somewhat suprised as if hearing about it for the first time and he calmly tells the inspector that he wanted to keep the threats on his wife a secret as not to bring on bad publicity for the Hollywood studio Inspector Craddock asks his aunt the renowned amateur detective Miss Jane Marple who injured her foot at the reception and is confined to her home for assistance
The main suspect Ella Zielinsky is later killed by a lethal nose spray after going to a pay phone in the village where she called the murderer and threatened to expose them At the climax Miss Marple now back on her feet visits Gossington Hall where Marina and Jason are staying and views where Heather Babcock s death occurred
Working from information received from her cleaning woman Cherry Baker who was working as a waitress the day of the murder the determined elderly sleuth begins to piece together the events of the fatal reception and solves the mystery Marina herself is the murderer In the film s denouement Miss Marple explains to Jason Rudd and Inspector Craddock about the two murders that have occurred
Heather Babcock s story was Marina s initial motive
Ten years earlier Miss Babcock suffered from German measles a rather harmless disease to most adults but problematic for a pregnant woman
Heather Babcock innocently infected Marina when she met her during World War II during a stage performance
Marina was about a month pregnant at the time the disease caused her child to be born with mental retardation
Upon hearing the unknowing Heather cheerfully tell this story Marina was overcome with rage and poisoned Heather without thinking
She then spread the idea that she was the intended victim in order to throw off suspicion from herself delivering death threats and poisoning her own coffee at the studio
Ella who made phone calls to various suspects from the town s pay phone accidentally guessed correctly apparently prompting Marina to murder her as well
Miss Marple also deducts that Jason Rudd knew about Marina s murderous secret after Inspector Craddock told him the other day about the death threat notes that Marina received
Jason saw right through the charade as he realized that Marina fabricated everything because she never told him about the death threat notes and thus decided to protect her Jason Marina s devoted husband confesses to Miss Marple that he actually administered a dosage of poison just last night to save her from prosecution
However when they enter Marina s room they see that Marina is now dead
However Marina didn t touch the hot chocolate Jason made for her and rather poisoned herself
As Marina is now dead she will not be brought to justice
On that note both Miss Marple and Inspector Craddock depart from Gossington Hall as the end credits role

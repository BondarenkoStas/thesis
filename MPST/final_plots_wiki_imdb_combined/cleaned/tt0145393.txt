After letting go of their former employer a crooked taxi driver who paid them a cut of what they could steal from his passengers Pablo and Cordobes steal from a crippled street vendor which ultimately leads to Sandra being arrested
Sandra because of her pregnancy starts to think about her future and the life she can make for her expected baby
When she is released from jail after a short time inside she makes Cordobes promise he ll straighten up and find a decent job instead of stealing again

Running out of time the group decides to rob a local nightclub
Pablo and Cordobes get back in touch with the cab driver only to beat him up and steal both his money and his guns

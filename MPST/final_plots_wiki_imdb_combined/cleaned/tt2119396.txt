The film starts in October 1952 after Alan Turing has been convicted
He is talking to his psychiatrist Dr Franz Greenbaum
Dr Greenbaum and Alan continue to discuss Alan informs Dr Greenbaum that he cannot talk about his war time activities
Dr Greenbaum informs him that he can talk about anything he wants
Sir Dermot Turing nephew of Alan is shown and he goes on to explain how life was for John Turing and Alan Turing during their childhood
David Leavitt appears next and talks about Turing s school time activities
David further explains that Turing was good at mathematics and athletics
His favourite sport was running
The scene shifts backs to the discussion between Turing and Dr Greenbaum
Turing speaks about a school friend he was interested in Christopher Morcom
They were in different houses so they could meet a couple of times a week
Turing worked on improving his handwriting because Christopher would make fun of it
Turing goes on to explain that he cared more about what Christopher thought about him than what he thought of himself
Christopher Morcom QC goes on to explain that Christopher and Turing became close friends during their school days
They were planning to join Cambridge University but on 13 February 1930 Christopher died
The scene again shifts backs to the discussion between Turing and Dr Greenbaum
Turing informs him that he wrote letters to Christopher s mother and even managed to acquire his photograph
He still has the photograph in his wallet and he shows it to Dr Greenbaum
Turing later goes on to publish his paper On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem
A computer in those days did not mean a machine it meant a person who calculates or computes
Turing proposes automating these tasks proposing a universal Turing machine
It involved performing mathematical operations using zeros and ones
This became the basis of modern computers
Steve Wozniak goes on to explain how normal people these days carry and use Turing machines in the form of mobile phones cameras computers etc
Alma Whitten explains that there are almost no fields of modern science and everyday life which are not impacted by a Turing machine
As World War II broke out he was recruiting to be part of Government Communications Headquarters based at Bletchley Park
It was a diverse group of people consisting of mathematicians chess players and crossword puzzle solvers
Asa Briggs goes on to say You needed exceptional talent you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing s was that genius
The Germans were coding their messages using Enigma machine which the Germans believed was unbreakable
Turing speaks about proposing to Joan Clarke and how he broke out the news that he had homosexual tendencies
But midway through he realized he could not continue with the relationship and called off the engagement
Turing admits he knew it would hurt Joan but he knew it was better to hurt her now rather than cheat on her and hurt her later
David Leavitt goes on explain how Alan Turing goes on to decrypt the German messages
Alan Turing designs the Bombe to decipher German Enigma machine encrypted secret messages
Turing and Dr Greenbaum continue to discuss if something like human consciousness can be kept in an inorganic vessel
The documentary now concentrates on Turing s paper on artificial intelligence Computing Machinery and Intelligence
The movie now concentrates on Turing s sexuality and his interaction with Arnold Murray which finally leads to his downfall
Turing and Dr Greenbaum discuss Turing s relationship with Arnold Murray
Turing explains that Arnold had moved into his house and he felt Arnold was stealing money from him
One day when he came home he found his father s pocket watch and other items missing
When Turing asked Arnold Arnold admitted his friend Harry committed the burglary
Turing reported the crime to the police
During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray
Dr Greenbaum explains to him that he should not have told them bluntly that he was homosexual
Turing entered a plea of guilty despite feeling no remorse or guilt for having committed acts of homosexuality
Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido
The documentary goes on to explain the impact of those events on Turing
During this stage Turing writes an article called The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis describing the way in which non uniformity may arise naturally out of a homogeneous uniform state
Turing was targeted by government officials which led him to feel that he could never have a normal life
The hormonal treatment also started having impact on him
Turing admits to Dr Greenbaum that he should have gone to prison instead of taking the hormonal treatment
During another interaction with Dr Greenbaum Turing speaks about killing himself by using a poisoned apple like in the story Snow White
The movie explains that On 8 June 1954 Turing s housekeeper found him dead
When his body was discovered an apple lay half eaten beside his bed
A post mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning

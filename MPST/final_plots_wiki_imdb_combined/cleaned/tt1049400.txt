Three disparate travelers a disillusioned preacher an unsuccessful prospector and a larcenous cynical con man meet at a decrepit railroad station in the 1870s Southwest
The prospector and the preacher were witnesses at the memorable rape and murder trial of the notorious bandit Juan Carrasco
The bandit duped an aristocratic Southerner Colonel Wakefield into believing he knew the location of a lost Aztec treasure
The greedy gentleman allowed himself to be tied up while Carasco assaulted his wife Nina
These events lead to the stabbing of the husband and Carrasco was tried convicted and condemned for the crimes
Everyone s account on the witness stand differed dramatically
Carrasco claimed that Wakefield was tied up with ropes while Nina was assaulted after which he killed the colonel in a duel
The newlywed wife contends that she was the one who killed her husband because he accused her of leading on Carrasco and causing the rape
The dead man testifies through a third witness an old Indian shaman who said that neither of those accounts was true
He insisted that the colonel used a jeweled dagger to commit suicide after the incident
It turns out that there was a fourth witness the prospector one with a completely new view of what actually took place
But can his version be trusted

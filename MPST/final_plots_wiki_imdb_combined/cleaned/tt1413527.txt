Five college students leave New York City for a weekend in the country and 48 hours later they vanished without a trace
To celebrate Miriam s birthday Miriam s Aunt Gail gives her use of a large country home in the Catskills for the weekend
Miriam invites her friends Cassy Mark Tanya and Leo to join her to celebrate
As an aspiring filmmaker Leo brings his new video camera hoping to create a short documentary of the weekend getaway
The five begin driving to the house
Whilst looking for a place to pull over because Tanya is carsick the group notice they are being bothered by a dark red van whose driver incessantly honks his horn at them and overtakes them only to slow down in front of them
They pass the van and continue on
They stop at a small gas station where Cassy notices a dark red van pull in and slow down
Spooked the gang leave
As they are driving away a girl from inside the gas station stops them to hand over a phone Cassy left in the bathroom
The group continue to Aunt Gail s home and are again tailed by the van
They stop at a diner and while eating the van pulls into the diner parking lot and drives slowly by the window
Furious Mark storms outside to confront the driver but he drives away when Mark gets too close
The group eventually make it to the house and Aunt Gail comes to turn the power on and wish them a good night
The five surprise Miriam with a birthday cake and then party and drink with Leo filming the whole occasion
The next day the group take a hike to the snowy woods which they soon get lost in the dark
They hear noises that they can t identify crackling sounds on their two way radio and branches snapping which scares them all into a run
They do eventually make it back to the house without further incident
Later when eating dinner they receive phone calls with no one answering
A knock at the door is heard and Mark finds a video tape wrapped in brown paper on the front step
The tape reveals that the group have been being secretly video taped since they were on the road and are being stalked by the same person in the maroon van
There is footage of them at the gas station with the girl running out to give Cassy back her phone and them at the diner when Mark attempted to confront the driver of the van proving it is the same van who has been following them the whole time
Then the footage follows them to Aunt Gail s house and shows film taken through the windows of the group laughing and having fun surprising Miriam with her birthday cake and to their horror the stalker inside the house filming them all as they slept
The phone rings again with no answer and then the line is cut
No one can get a signal on their cell phones
The group decide to leave but when they run out to the car they see that it is missing
A van pulls up in the driveway scaring the group back into the house
As everyone tries to get a signal on their phones again all the power in the house goes out
Miriam finally gets a signal on her phone and dials 9 1 1 but the call drops out
Down the hall the group hear a noise
Mark gets a knife and goes to investigate
He finds a two way radio that is on and crackling
The door suddenly shuts from the inside and Mark s cries of pain can be heard
Cassy bangs on the door and tries to open it and then it opens just a crack which scares the group into running upstairs to hide
Upstairs the group see the van driving away from the house so they come back downstairs to leave
Leo gives the camera to Tanya and leads the way out but once outside he sees something that makes him scream at the others to run back inside
Once inside Tanya falls breaking the camera and all left is the audio sound of Tanya screaming and her and Leo s fate is left unknown
On the video footage of the van outside Miriam is shown to be running from the house
The van turns on its lights and creeps along to follow her
The van stops and the stalker gets out and chases a screaming Miriam into the woods
Back inside the house the other stalker is looking around the house for Cassy with his nightvision on the camera
He finds Cassy hiding behind a couch and believing she is alone creeping out wandering blindly around the home
The stalker follows her watching how far she will get
Cassy gets to the door but it is pulled shut from the outside and the camera man makes the same sound the group heard in the woods alerting Cassy of his presence
She screams as he then lunges out at her and the camera freezes on Cassy s screaming face
The view pulls back and shows to a dark room were the stalker is watching several videos on many monitors
As well as the stalkers footage there is also the footage Leo shot implying the stalkers stole his camera
The last piece of film shows the stalker with the camera in a park surveying groups of friends
While looking around he spots another group of friends filming
He then follows them on their trip
During the end credits the video of the stalker s movements are shown from the moment he first spotted the group on the highway following them to the house filming them through the windows and while they sleep
Many of the close up shots focus solely on Cassy

In January 1945 as the Second World War in Europe is reaching its end much of the Netherlands remains under Nazi occupation
One night a Nazi collaborator is shot dead on his bicycle
The family whose house he falls down in front of moves the body in front of the neighboring house where the Steenwijk family lives
The Nazis assuming that the Steenwijks killed the collaborator execute the parents and older brother together with a large number of hostages
Burning the Steenwijk s house to the ground they imprison the younger brother Anton
The other person in his unlit cell is an older woman
Anton can see only her mouth
She spends the next few minutes comforting him until he is removed from the cell
After the Netherlands are liberated from Nazi occupation Anton remains shaken by what has happened
The story moves between the end of World War II and the 1980s following Steenwijk s often reluctant quest for the truth about the events of that traumatic night

The play begins with Trevor being tried in court charged with throwing a brick through the window of a Pakistani man Mr Shahnawaz
He has also been charged with shoplifting from Harrods
Trevor is defiant when questioned by the judge
Trevor s social worker Harry Parker takes him to Hooper Street Residential Assessment Centre where his punishment will be determined
The centre s deputy superintendent Peter Clive admits Trevor and he s allocated a room with Errol
The next day Trevor leaves the assessment centre to job hunt
Trevor accompanied by Errol breaks into a car and drives to the job centre
Near the job centre he buys Evo Stik for huffing and immediately enters the job centre
Trevor breaks the queue demanding a job from the job centre attendant
When asked to wait he storms out and hurls a brick through the window
He makes his escape and walks with Errol to an abandoned swimming pool where he has hidden some tools
Trevor pockets the tools and hands Errol a bunch of keys instructing him to get it into the centre and hide it
He then breaks into another car and takes it and drives away
He orders Errol to get out saying he is visiting some mates
Later Trevor is eating a sandwich in the car
Peter Clive arrives and notices Trevor in the car
Trevor discards the sandwich and walks into the assessment centre
Peter Clive tells him to get rid of the car
Trevor agrees
Inside the assessment centre Trevor refuses to co operate
He demands lunch only to be informed that he is too late
In a rage he tries kicking down the cafeteria door
The chef rushes out only to be kicked in the groin by Trevor who unleashes a vicious attack on him before being stopped by care worker Barry Giller
Trevor is then held down by the chef and Barry and locked up in a room
The superintendent arrives proceeding to show Trevor an overview of what he has been through and where he is heading prison
He explains that the assessment centre is Trevor s last chance to change the cycle of poverty crime and prison
Uncharacteristically Trevor is not aggressive and is lost for words
The superintendent is extremely articulate and faces little resistance from Trevor
As soon as the superintendent leaves Trevor is back to his usual self
Trevor refuses to keep the peace and eventually Barry and Peter decide to send him to a secure unit
However while Barry is out making arrangements to send Trevor away Peter offers to take Trevor banger racing if he promises to behave
Trevor accepts the offer on condition that he be allowed to drive
Peter informs Barry about the change of plans and warns Trevor that he is doing him a favour by giving him another chance and that if Trevor lets him down he ll team up with the chef and some of the biggest lads in the centre to kill Trevor
They go to the races as planned and Trevor is given a chance to drive as promised
Trevor seems to enjoy the experience but gets into an accident after which his car will not restart
Trevor is unable to complete the race
On the drive back to the assessment centre Peter informs Trevor that he was up against professional racers did well
He also tells him that he could join a racing team if he wished and need not go around stealing cars any longer
Trevor makes no reply and blankly stares out the window
They reach the assessment centre late and have to be let in by the janitor since Peter cannot find his keys
After everybody has retired to bed Trevor wakes up Errol and shows him Peter Clive s keys which Trevor claims to have picked up after Peter dropped them
Trevor and Errol make their way into the office where Trevor rummages through the documents until he finds their respective files
Trevor reads through Errol s reports and contract and finds a report titled The Future which reads It seems unlikely for this child to return home his mother having rejected him for her own lifestyle
Bearing this in mind future care seems to be the alternative
We would recommend a care order be made in order to be able to continue our assessment of his needs
He then proclaims to Errol You re in here for life mate
Errol looks confused and dejected and asks What ll I do
Trevor is enraged
He drops the files on the floor and tells Errol to urinate and defecate on it
Errol defecates on his files and Trevor urinates on his
Trevor and Errol get out of the assessment centre and drive away in the centre s Ford Transit van
They reach Mr Shahnawaz s neighbourhood and hurl stones through the windows and scream racial slurs
They get into the van and drive away
Trevor drives to a police station and smashes the van into a car
Errol is rendered unconscious by the impact
Trevor exits the van and runs away leaving Errol to be apprehended by the police
Trevor begins walking to Harry Parker s apartment
On his way Trevor looks into a shop window displaying a television clothes mannequins and other items
He stares at them and their accompanying price tags intently
He begins running into a tunnel and screams Bollocks
Inside the tunnel he discards his T shirt and screams at a passing vehicle after trying to kick it
Trevor walks past a school presumably his pausing to gaze through the iron gates before continuing on his way
It is early morning by the time Trevor reaches Harry Parker s home
Harry is busy packing and is preparing to leave on a holiday with his family
He is displeased to see Trevor in this state
He tells him to go back to the assessment centre before it is too late
Trevor informs Harry of his misadventures and tells him that he is turning himself in
Harry although reluctant at first makes the necessary calls to the police
Trevor is seen in a prison cell pressing the buzzer in the room
The police officer orders him to keep his hands off the buzzer
Trevor walks away but returns and proceeds to press the buzzer with his head
This time another officer P C
Anson enters with a truncheon
He orders Trevor to stay quiet but Trevor continues to provoke him saying that he is a juvenile offender and that he must be taken care of and sent back to the assessment centre
Anson orders him to shut up and sit down
He tells Trevor that he would be taken to court in a few days and this time he will end up in a detention centre or a borstal not an assessment centre
He threatens to have his fingerprints taken as soon as he leaves the borstal and use them to convict him of every unsolved taking and driving away in the district dating back months
Trevor is still unfazed and sarcastically sneers Sounds great
Anson is livid and brings the truncheon down hitting Trevor on the kneecap
P C
Anson smiles and says You think you re hard don t you
Trevor for the first time looks defeated
He slumps in agony and shock his face reddening
The warder tells Trevor that he is all talk and decries his protests saying that he has no choice but to respect authority and obey the rules like everybody else
The play ends with Trevor recovering from the pain and grinning as the warders shut the door of his cell

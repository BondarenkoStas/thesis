Réda is a French Moroccan teenager due to sit for Baccalauréat
When his devout father asks Réda to accompany him on a pilgrimage to Mecca he reluctantly agrees
However the father insists that they travel by car
As both embark on a road trip thousands of kilometers away from southern France the once icy father and son relationship starts to thaw as both gradually come to know each other
Réda speaks only in French to his father who is seen speaking only Arabic for the majority of the film
Later when necessary the father proves that he in fact speaks impeccable French his choice to speak only Arabic to his son is therefore purposeful
Along the way the two meet several interesting characters
They encounter an aged woman clad in black
Though they attempt to leave her behind she repeatedly reappears in various scenes
The son learns about Islam and why his father thought it would be preferable to make the pilgrimage by car rather than by plane
Throughout the trip different situations expose how different the father and son are through their actions and outlooks
In one instance after the father claimed to have been robbed Réda refuses to part with any of the remaining money when a mother with a child asks him for some but his father readily gives the woman money
During their journey Réda dreams that he is watching his father herding goats but does not respond when he calls out for his father to save him from quicksand
After all their hardships they reach Mecca but the father dies soon after the first day
That night he is still looking for his father but instead sees a person herding goats who barely glances at him
After he finds out his father dies he sells his car and gives to a beggar on the street
The route taken by the father and son goes from Provence France through Italy Slovenia Croatia Serbia Bulgaria Turkey Syria and Jordan before reaching Saudi Arabia

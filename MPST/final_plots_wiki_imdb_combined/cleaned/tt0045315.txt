Much like in Hair Raising Hare Bugs finds himself trapped in the castle of an evil scientist who this time is a caricature of Boris Karloff and needs the rabbit s brain to complete an experiment
When Bugs awakens he is terrified when he sees the scientist a sarcophagus and the robot experiment eventually running away upon seeing all three
The scientist sends out Gossamer wearing a pair of sneakers to retrieve him with the promise of being rewarded with a spider goulash
In a scene very similar to the one in Hair Raising Hare Bugs keeps running until a door on the floor opens and a rock falls into a water pit where there are crocodiles swimming around
While he is walking backwards and praying to jump over the crocodiles he bumps into Rudolf
Bugs comes up with an idea and makes as a gabby hairdresser giving the hairy monster a new hairdo He gets some dynamite sticks and places them in the monster s hair which give the appearance of curlers
He lights them and runs off just before the explosion which leaves Rudolf with a bald head
Rudolf after tying his hair back up in a cone goes after Bugs
In the chemical room Bugs sees a bottle of vanishing fluid and pours it all over himself becoming invisible
Bugs gets a trash can and dumps it on Rudolf
Then he gets a mallet and hits the trash can causing it to shake then pulls out the rug Rudolf is standing on from underneath his feet causing him to fall on his bottom
For the coup de gr√¢ce Bugs takes a bottle of reducing oil and pours the entire contents over Rudolf shrinking him
Putting on a suit coat and hat and grabbing two suitcases Rudolf enters a mouse hole kicks its resident out and slams the door which bears a sign saying I QUIT
The mouse says I quit too holding up a bottle of whiskey then dashing away
Bugs eats a carrot in satisfaction of getting rid of the monster
Suddenly the mad scientist makes him visible with hare restorer insisting the rabbit hand over his brain
When Bugs Bunny refuses the scientist throws an axe straight at him
Bugs ducks and the axe breaks open a large bottle of ether whose fumes drugs Bugs and the scientist
The groggy scientist chases after an equally groggy Bugs in slow motion
Bugs slowly trips the scientist who falls asleep
Still slowly Bugs runs out of the castle and over the horizon tripping over a rock and falling asleep landing in a stream which leads Bugs straight back into his flooded hole
He suddenly wakes up and declares that it must have been a nightmare
The miniature Rudolf passes by on a rowboat and tells him in a high pitched voice Oh yeah
That s what you think leaving Bugs with a confused look on his face

Setting Like its predecessors Jak 3 takes place in an unnamed fictional universe created by Naughty Dog specially for the games
The game is set one year after the events of Jak II
Jak 3 largely focuses on the Wasteland a large desert only briefly referred to in the previous entry in the series as being completely uninhabited and inhospitable
Spargus City a large settlement within the Wasteland bordering the ocean is where the game begins and serves as a hub for the player where new weapons and upgrades can be earned and most missions are given out
Later on the plot shifts focus to Haven City a sprawling metropolis which was the central locale in Jak II though the area is only a fifth the size of the Wasteland
Some levels from the previous game are radically altered or removed entirely while others are added branching off from Spargus and the Wasteland and Haven
Characters As in the games before it Jak 3 s two main protagonists are Jak and his best friend Daxter the ottsel which is a fictional cross between an otter and a weasel
Jak is revealed to have the birth name of Mar in this game named after his ancestor and the original founder of Haven City Mar
Jak s mechanic friend Keira returns in this game
There is also Ashelin the Governor of Haven City who was previously involved with Torn the now commander of the Freedom League
Daxter s love interest Tess returns as a weapons designer and Jak s mentor Samos also makes appearances through the game
A new character Damas is first introduced here
It is revealed that not only did Damas lose his son but was the leader of Haven City before being betrayed by Baron Praxis and being banished to the desert
More minor but returning characters include Sig a spy for Damas back in Haven City who later becomes the new king of Spargus after Damas is killed Jinx a former member of the Underground Vin whose brain now resides inside a computer and Pecker Onin s translator from Jak 2 becomes an adviser to Damas in the early parts of the game
Few of the original antagonists from Jak II reappear in this game
A new secondary villain is Count Veger a self absorbed Haven City aristocrat who banishes Jak to the wasteland at the beginning of the game
The player later finds that Veger attacked the Palace himself wishing to journey to the core of the planet and gain the power of the Precursors
Even as he attempts this a species known as the Dark Makers begin to invade the planet seeking to destroy it
The Dark Makers are Precursors who have been corrupted by Dark Eco similar to the antagonists of The Precursor Legacy
The main antagonist is the former Krimzon Guard commander Erol first introduced in Jak II renamed Cyber Errol
He is a cybernetic version of himself as he was badly wounded in Jak II when he crashed into a supply of Eco barrels in an attempt to kill Jak
Sometime before the start of this game he restarts the manufacturing of Krimzon Guard Deathbots whose original factory was shut down during the events of the previous game
Errol launches a war against Haven City in tandem with the remaining Metal Head monsters and later forges an alliance with the Dark Makers
He obtains a massive Dark Maker terraforming robot at the end of the game with which he attempts to destroy the planet
The Terraformer is destroyed by Jak as it advances through the Wasteland towards Spargus City
Story The game begins with Jak and Daxter being banished into the Wasteland by the tyrannical Count Veger for supposed crimes against Haven City
Ashelin who opposes the banishment gives Jak a beacon before she leaves and tells him to stay alive
As they travel through the desert flashbacks reveal that Haven City is at war between Freedom League and the surviving Metal Heads and new Krizmon Guard Death Bots
The Palace is then destroyed by an unknown force
As Jak Daxter and Pecker lose consciousness they are rescued by a group of desert dwellers who take them back to Spargus City
Jak awakens in the throne room of King Damas who explains that he has been brought to the city of Spargus
As repayment for saving his life Damas insists that Jak undergo a series of challenges and tasks to prepare him for Spargan citizenship
Together with Daxter Jak also meets Seem a monk who warns him of the Day Star a sign that the end of the world is at hand
While exploring Seem s temple Jak is once again contacted by the Precursors who reveal that the Day Star heralds the return of the Dark Ones their mortal enemies
To fight them Jak is given the first of several powers based on Light Eco giving him greater control over his existing Dark Eco powers
Ashelin Haven City s governor asks the duo to assist her forces
Jak initially refuses out of spite but changes his mind when Ashelin returns his amulet
While traveling through an old Eco mine to reach the city Veger shows up and admits that he faked the charges against Jak to get rid of him
Believing that only the power of the Precursors can save Haven City the Count reactivates a Precursor mech and leaves them to die
Jak manages to destroy the mech in an explosion and enters the city
With their help the city s defenders learn that the enemy forces are being led by Errol a former Krimzon Guard captain presumed dead in a hoverbike accident and who is now a cyborg
Meanwhile Jak and Daxter journey to the forest and restore a Precursor telescope learning that the Day Star is actually the mothership of the Dark Makers a group of Precursors corrupted by Dark Eco
Realizing that Errol is but a pawn of the Dark Makers the duo launch an assault on his airborne fortress and defeat him in battle
The base is destroyed but Errol escapes and the Dark Makers attack both Seem s temple and Spargus destroying or stealing any artifacts that can be used against them
Seem however hides one artifact and gives it to Jak
After a successful attack destroys the Metal Head Tower Errol s forces are scattered and Jak and Daxter are free to return to the Wasteland
As a reward for bravery Jak is made a full citizen of Spargus
Samos contacts him with news that an advanced Precursor defense system has been located within the planet s core and that only its power can defeat the Dark Makers
With Damas s help the duo fight their way through a gauntlet of enemy troops
Before they can get to safety Damas suffers a fatal wound
Revealing himself to be the former ruler of Haven City he begs Jak to find his son Mar showing him an exact copy of Jak s amulet saying Mar wore an exact replica as a symbol of their lineage with the house of Mar
This leads Jak to realize that Damas was his father
Veger appears and confirms the realization revealing that he had kidnapped Jak from Damas during his exile to harness Jak s eco gifts before losing him to the underground
Veger sneers at Jak s anguish that Damas would never know of his son before taking a hovercraft into the catacombs
An enraged Jak spurred on by Daxter pursues Veger into the catacombs
The duo arrive near the planet s core where they find Precursor artifacts and platforms on a planetary defense system created by the Precursors
A Precursor appears and assists Jak in activating the defense system which begins charging
For his heroics Jak is offered the chance to evolve into a Precursor however Veger intervenes and takes the evolution for himself
Following this it is accidentally revealed that the Precursors were actually mere ottsels that were operating machinery to maintain the facade
While still powerful the ottsels insisted that they needed to fluff up the myth if they wanted Jak s people to look up to them
While Daxter celebrates that his initial transformation in The Precursor Legacy was a blessing rather than a curse Veger realizes his mistake and to his horror is transformed into an ottsel
The Precursors send Jak and Daxter through a teleporter to the Dark Maker ship to stop Errol from unleashing its power on the planet before the defense system is fully charged
Jak attempts to stop Errol but fails as Errol pilots a massive terraforming vessel down to the planet
Jak barely manages to escape before the ship is destroyed but returns to the ground in time to watch Errol and his vessel touch down and then attack the Wasteland
Jak engages the vessel crippling its legs and demobilizing it before climbing to the top of the vessel to confront Errol in the cockpit
Jak defeats Errol and blows up the terraformer killing him for good
Ashelin and Sig witness Jak and Daxter walking away victorious and Ashelin kisses Jak
After a celebration the Precursors bid farewell vowing to continue their struggle against the Dark Makers
As a gift they grant Daxter a pair of pants which was a recurring joke throughout the series
Jak is offered a place in their ranks but decides to stay with Daxter instead

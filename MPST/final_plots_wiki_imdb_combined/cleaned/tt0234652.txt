In an anonymous American town Tom Gerrick is a Wall Street Whiz Kid
He s also a serial killer
Six victims have had their eyes cut out six their ears cut off and three their tongues removed
By the time he gets to his fourth tongue victim Gerrick is getting sick of his success
Detectives Jim Renart and Dorothy Smith are under pressure from their superior to capture the killer and they finally get a break when Gerrick offers himself for questioning
He calls the police himself claiming to have found the body of the sixteen year old girl on the street
He wants to get caught but first he wants to play with his captors for a while
His initial sensitivity to the crime is soon replaced with a psycho smirk and a high priced lawyer
By the time the police find out he is the killer he is on a shooting spree first on live television during an interviews on the secret of success then at his ex fianc√©s non wedding party
Actually catching Gerrick proves to be a difficult matter especially with the feds set to take over the case in mere hours

On the last day of school before summer vacation physical education teacher Freddy Shoop is preparing to leave on a vacation to Hawaii with his girlfriend Kim
Vice principal Phil Gills informs several underachieving students including easily distracted Pam nocturnal Larry a male stripper football jock Kevin pregnant Rhonda geeky Alan dyslexic Denise intimidating Jerome and two horror film obsessed underachievers Dave and Francis a k a
Chainsaw that they must attend summer school for remedial English
After the teacher scheduled to teach the class wins the lottery and immediately quits work Gills searches for a replacement among the teachers still on school grounds but each manages to evade him after learning what he wants them to do
He finally manages to corner Shoop and blackmails him into taking the job or risk losing tenure
On his first day Shoop meets Robin Bishop who is teaching History next door
Shoop falls for her but she is already dating Gills
Shoop s first day is a disaster
Most of the students do not attend and Jerome goes to the bathroom and doesn t return
A beautiful Italian transfer student Anna Maria arrives and will be learning English much to the delight of Dave and Chainsaw
After the remaining students attempt to leave class as well Shoop admits he has no idea how to teach them
Rather than studying he and the students spend their first few days having fun and going to the beach a theme park and a petting zoo until Gills finds out
Gills threatens to fire Shoop unless his students pass the end of term test
Shoop promises each teen a favor if they study
The kids agree so Shoop gives Denise driving lessons accompanies Rhonda to Lamaze classes gives Kevin football lessons allows Dave to throw a party in his house gives Larry a bed in the classroom lets Chainsaw arrange a screening of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre in class and allows Pam to move in with him
Seeing he is still floundering as a teacher Robin tells Shoop to make learning fun
Shoop begins to grow closer to the kids
They study to pass their English basic skills exam worried that Gills is going to fire Shoop unless all his students pass
Shoop is arrested when he covers for Chainsaw and Dave after they are found in possession of alcohol
Robin and Gills bail him out of jail
Gills then inadvertently exposes his true self to Robin when he states he cares nothing for Shoop or his students and she overhears him causing her to storm off
Larry loses his stripper job when he is found out by his aunt and his mother who are attending the club where he works
The students make more demands on Shoop and he throws an English Book against the chalkboard and after a few choice words quits his job in anger
He is convinced to return when his students start feeling guilty about what they did and scare off Shoop s replacement with a series of gory stunts reminiscent of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
Shoop and his students then begin preparing for the test in earnest and even Jerome who had gone to the bathroom weeks before returns
The exam goes smoothly despite Rhonda going into labor soon after it starts
Not all pass so Gills is ready to follow through with his firing threat
However the parents of the students come to Shoop s defense
Because of the students marked improvement Principal Kelban grants Shoop tenure for his positive efforts
That evening at sunset Shoop and Robin are walking on the beach and begin kissing in the waves a la From Here to Eternity but Shoop s dog Wondermutt dives in to steal a few kisses for himself

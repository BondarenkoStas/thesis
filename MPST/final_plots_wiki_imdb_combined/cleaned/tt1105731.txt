Samantha Sam is an orphaned young woman who moves to an isolated boarding house in North Jakarta trying to avoid the advances of her pervert stepfather
The landlady of the house Yanti tells her that the house was previously a batik factory of Mangkoedjiwo family with its current leader Raden Ayu Sri Sukmarahimi Mangkoedjiwo having lent the house under a condition that the second floor is locked up with no one allowed inside
While listing other restrictions including about a chair in front of a Javanese mirror in Sam s room Yanti chants durmo a Javanese poem said to be able to summon Kuntilanak a female ghost with half the body of a horse rumored to be living in a weeping fig in front of the house
Meanwhile Sam mentions her recurring nightmares of a woman in a fire with a Kuntilanak to her boyfriend Agung
Agung learns from his eccentric friend Iwank and his mother that the Mangkoedjiwo is long rumored to be a black magic sect maintaining a Kuntilanak itself can only be summoned by antique objects
At the house Sam befriends Dinda who tells her that there are actually three other mirrors identical to the one in Sam s room two of which are in herself and Ratih s rooms
One day Sam breaks the rule about the mirror glimpsing a Kuntilanak in the process
Her neighbor Mawar who is with her boyfriend threatens to kill Sam but Sam suddenly enters a trance and chants durmo making her puke maggots and materialize a strange scar as well as causing Mawar to have nosebleed
At a motel Mawar is killed when an electric fan drops on her neck
The next night Sam tries to peek on the second floor but is harassed by a neighbor Alfon
She enters into a trance and chants durmo again
Haunted by terrifying apparitions Alfon tries to escape but is killed in a car accident
In the light of recent events Sri Sukma pays visit to the house
Yanti apologizes for her foolish act in introducing durmo to Sam although Sri Sukma says that it is her destiny to keep it
While reading a book about Mangkoedjiwo factory in Iwank s house Sam spots the sentence Sing kuat sing melihara
During a conflict with Agung Sam chants durmo the next day she learns Agung has disappeared
She hears Agung s faint cries from the second floor
Sam discusses Agung s disappearance with Dinda but misunderstands Dinda s comfort as her being attracted to Agung
Chanting durmo Sam passes out when Dinda goes out to take shower where she is killed by Kuntilanak
Having had enough Sam breaks over to the second floor and finds Agung bleeding in front of the fourth mirror Dinda previously forgot to mention
She is confronted by Sri Sukma who explains that the Mangkoedjiwo does indeed maintain a Kuntilanak summoned by a wangsit kept by their heirs but since Sri Sukma is unable to bear children she has chosen Sam as the next carrier of the wangsit
When Sam refuses Sri Sukma chants durmo to summon Kuntilanak though Sam counters with her own durmo eventually winning out when Sri Sukma has nosebleed
Pleading Sam not to kill her Sri Sukma says that the Kuntilanak can be stopped by removing its entrance to the living world by breaking all mirrors
Sam manages to break the mirrors in her Dinda and Ratih s rooms but forgets the one in the second floor long enough before Kuntilanak kills Sri Sukma
Two ghost children appear to take Sam who manages to break free only to be cornered by Kuntilanak
However she continuously chants Sing kuat sing melihara until the Kuntilanak obeys and goes back to the mirror
The next day Sam decides to keep the mirror so she could use it for her own deeds disturbing Agung
She happily chants durmo as apparitions of Kuntilanak come out of the mirror

Television personality Pat Novak starts off an episode of his show The Novak Element by pointing out that every country in the world except for the United States is under high security with droids from multinational conglomerate OmniCorp His camera crew takes a look from Tehran where one OmniCorp employee Rick Maddox is handing out red asset bracelets to one of Novak s reporters and camera crews as they observe the large droids and other robots doing a scan on citizens in the area
From inside a compound a mother and her son Navid watch the droids do their work
Navid s father Arash leads a group of suicide bombers outside to capture themselves getting killed live on international television
They launch their attack with all the bombers getting themselves killed by the droids though they succeed in taking out some of the EM 208 droids themselves
Navid runs out with a knife in hand
The ED 209 droid decides he is a threat giving it probable cause to machine gun him
The camera crew captures all of this Novak continues by admiring how the droids handled the situation pointing out that OmniCorp CEO Raymond Sellars has the right idea to push forward for use of these droids in the U S but Senator Hubert Dreyfuss is against it having issued the Dreyfuss Act to prevent this type of law enforcement
Novak ends by asking why America is so robophobic In Detroit we meet Detroit Police Department detective Alex Murphy walking to a meeting with Chief Karen Dean
In her office are two other cops John Lake and Andre Daniels
Dean reprimands Murphy for taking on a case without bringing it to her first as it cost the lives of six individuals and his partner Jack Lewis has been shot and hospitalized as the result of a shootout with men working for crime boss Antoine Vallon
Once Lake and Daniels leave the office Murphy tells his story Murphy s story is told in flashback
He and Lewis have been undercover to crack down on a recent shipment of illegal firearms
Posing as buyers they interview a dealer named Jerry White but they begin to think he s selling dirty weapons
Acting like they believe Jerry is an undercover cop they scare him into revealing that he works for Antoine Vallon
Murphy and Lewis run the serial numbers of the weapons being sold and discover something shocking they are guns that should have been locked up in the evidence room which means Vallon s got a cop or two who are on his payroll On a rainy night Murphy and Lewis go to a restaurant to meet with Vallon
Lewis insists that they need backup since Vallon s guys might shoot them for target practice but Murphy overrules his concerns arguing that calling for backup will tip Vallon off
Inside the restaurant Vallon and his right hand man hear Murphy and Lewis out and appear to fall for their undercover identities
Unfortunately somebody betrays Murphy and Lewis to Vallon and notifies Vallon by smartphone
Vallon immediately leaves the table While Vallon is standing up a car pulls up in front of the restaurant and a group of gunmen armed with pistols and submachine guns open fire
Murphy and Lewis return fire with their pistols pinned down in one of the booths
After a lengthy exchange of gunfire during which several henchmen are killed Murphy escapes outside by jumping through a glass window into an alleyway
A couple of henchmen are waiting in the alley to ambush him
Murphy uses a dumpster as a shield while advancing on and shooting at the henchmen
He kills two of them and the remaining one escapes by foot
Lewis prepares to follow Murphy when a henchman hiding in the kitchen bursts out and fires on him
He manages to return fire and kill the henchman but in the process is shot in his right shoulder
Murphy stays with him until an ambulance can arrive In the present Chief Dean reminds Murphy that he isn t supposed to carry out such an assignment without talking to her first In Washington DC Sellars is at a hearing with Senator Dreyfuss in regards to the matter of using OmniCorp droids as law enforcement
Dreyfuss argues that a machine could not feel anything if it were to kill anybody even a child
Sellars later returns to OmniCorp Headquarters to meet with his marketing associates Liz Kline and Tom Pope
Realizing that more than half of the country s population will not stand behind a machine protecting its citizens Sellars proposes that they get a man into a machine At the OmniCorp rehab center Dr Dennett Norton and his assistant Jae Kim are tending to a man who has had his arms replaced with artificial robotic limbs
Although he is nervous to use them at first Dr Norton convinces him to give it a go
The man starts to play the guitar and he and his wife are overcome with joy
The man s emotional levels begin to rise which would interfere with the program
He tones it down but then says he needs emotions to play
Dr Norton is then called away by Sellars
They along with Kline and Pope review potential amputee candidates for the man in a machine program all of them veteran police officers but Dr Norton and Sellars reject each one either due to their physical form or their personal reputations Meanwhile it s revealed to us that the two officers Chief Dean shooed out of her office earlier Lake and Daniels are the men who betrayed Murphy to Vallon
They tell him that Murphy is going to visit Lewis at hospital
While Murphy is inside the hospital one of Vallon s men walks up to Murphy s car and plants a bomb in the left front wheel well Alex goes home to his wife Clara and 10 year old son David
After putting David to bed he and Clara start to get intimate when the car alarm starts going off
Worrying that it ll wake David Alex goes to turn it off
The car alarm is a trap and as expect it lures him outside and the car is then blown up remotely
Clara runs outside to find her husband lying on the front steps of her house burning Clara is met by Norton and his associates to discuss Alex s condition
He has suffered fourth degree burns both his legs and one arm were amputated he is blind in one eye and will probably be deaf
The team attempts to persuade Clara to give consent to use Alex for the program but she is concerned as to what kind of life he will have Three Months Later Alex is at a party with Clara along with Jack and his wife
Alex and Clara dance to a Frank Sinatra song
This turns out to be a memory that Norton and Kim are viewing as they put the finishing touches on Alex s new mechanical suit
They wake him up and he is in shock as to what he sees
He grabs Norton by the throat and throws him down
Kim tries to shut Alex down as he runs out of the room but Norton tells her to let him go
Alex continues to run until he hops over the wall of the facility and through a field
Norton tells Kim to shut him down Back in the lab Norton speaks with Alex face to face and shows him just what is left of him only his head heart lungs and brain are there
Alex is horrified by this and requests that he die
Norton reminds him that Clara signed the consent forms so if they let him die the work will have been for nothing
Alex later talks to Clara through a video chat
She is happy to hear from him again
Afterwards he later sees news reports on his attempted murder a lack of evidence to trace back to Vallon as well as interviews featuring Lake Daniels and Jack Alex is put through training and is set to get familiar with his program
As Maddox shows him his suit can respond to a threat taking out a firearm if needed
Alex is taken a simulator room where he is placed next to a basic robot
As shown on a monitor the robot responds to threats quicker than Alex who hesitates and is conscious of potentially harming civilians
Maddox quips that he wouldn t buy that for a dollar In another training facility Alex is put to the test against Maddox in an exoskeleton along with other robots
As Alex easily maneuvers through the robots gunfire he shoots them all
Norton tells Sellars that although Alex thinks he is the one carrying out these actions he is merely carrying out orders as programmed
Kline points out that this is illegal but Sellars thinks it s fully legal for a machine to think it is a man
Once Alex is done he tases Maddox for good measure Norton drives Alex to his home where he will get to see Clara and David for the first time
David set up a welcome home banner for his father
Alex enters his home and although both Clara and David are surprised by his new appearance they still embrace him A public press conference is held to present the new and reformed Murphy to the city
While he is getting set up Norton and Kim see on a monitor the emotions going through Murphy s head as they put the police database information into his head
When he starts to remember his attempted murder he becomes overwhelmed and starts to have a seizure
Dr Norton catches him and starts to get pressed by Kline and Pope to find a solution
He and Kim resolve to lower Murphy s emotional levels
He walks out to find Clara and David waiting for him
David says hello to his dad but Murphy just continues walking with no expression
He passes Sellars and the mayor as they extend their hands to him
Once he steps out before everybody the crowd goes silent
Through Murphy s vision he assesses that nobody is a threat until he spots one man in the crowd Thomas King who is wanted for murder
Murphy calls the man out to arrest him
King begins to run until Murphy hops into the crowd and shoots him with a taser round to the back knocking him down Novak brings this up on the show as a reason for people to finally get behind this new program
He notes that King stood within spitting distance of two cops who could not identify him and that he has eluded the police for six years on charges of rape assault and murder yet Alex was able to catch him within a minute
As a result public opinion on the Dreyfuss Act begins to change
The citizens of Detroit begin to embrace Alex giving him the nickname of RoboCop though some are against this due to the belief that the police work belongs to human cops and not a robot
However Sellars tells Dr Norton to for the meantime keep Murphy away from his family At the police station Murphy comes in as Dean briefs the other officers on several murder suspects
Murphy says he will take on the case to look for a criminal named John Biggs
He patrols through the city on his motorcycle
He catches a few totally stoned junkies getting one to tell him where Biggs s drug lab is
Murphy finds the lab and has a shoot out with Biggs s goons
Biggs tries to run but Murphy has him cornered
He tries to throw a grenade at Murphy but he gets tased and drops it blowing himself up in the process As Murphy is set to continue he is stopped on the street by Clara
She pleads for him to hear her as she tells him that David is traumatized and is having nightmares
He rides off and accesses CCTV footage to show the reporters hounding Clara and David as she tries to take him to school
Unable to show his face David retreats to the car Murphy rides back to his home and inspects the crime scene where is car blew up
He reviews the footage of the explosion to realize how David witnessed his father s burning body leaving him fearful anxious and distressed
Afterwards he locates Jerry White and pulls him out of his car to get him to give him a number to one of Vallon s goons
He traces it to locate Vallon s warehouse
When someone tips off Vallon to Murphy s impending arrival he rallies his men to grab their guns and turn the lights off and watch out for Murphy with night vision goggles
The crooks open fire on Murphy getting his suit shot but he kills all the men and finally shoots Vallon down
Murphy picks up a gun and scans it for fingerprints picking up prints from Lake and Daniels Murphy returns to the police station followed by Jack
He interrogates Lake and Daniels showing the meeting through every monitor in the station to prove their involvement in the car bombing
Daniels tries to shoot Murphy but gets shot in return
Lake admits that Dean was involved with both the shootout at the restaurant and the car bomb
He tases Lake and goes to confront Dean
Before he can get a confession out of her Maddox operating from the facility shuts Murphy down
Maddox reports this to Sellars who is in his helicopter On another episode of The Novak Element Novak comments on how Murphy exposed the corruption within the police department further suggesting why it s time to finally put the robots out on the street
Meanwhile Sellars meets with Maddox Kline and Pope to talk about the state of Murphy s condition
Kline issues a statement to the public to say that Murphy is in critical condition
Sellars decides that they can use Murphy as a symbol of martyrdom to stir up sympathy
Additionally the Dreyfuss Act is repealed
Clara demands to see her husband but is denied Sellars sends Maddox and other mercenaries out to destroy Murphy preparing to tell Clara that Alex died from his injuries
Kline arrives at Clara s home and escorts her and David to HQ to meet with Sellars
With Kim s help Dr Norton runs into the facility where Murphy is being kept warning him that the mercenaries are sent by Sellars and are there to kill both of them
Murphy wakes up in time to kill the two goons before they can fire at him and Norton Murphy rides his motorcycle to OmniCorp Headquarters and gets help from Lewis who has rallied the SWAT team to assist
He tases one guard outside the building forcing the others to stand down
He flips his motorcycle into the building getting the attention of two ED 209 droids
They shoot at Murphy but he gets them to shoot at each other
A third droid is caught in the chaos and falls from a great height and Alex s arm is caught beneath it
As more droids come in Murphy is forced to grab a submachine gun and shoot his left arm off
The droids shoot at him bringing him down
Lewis runs in and stands in front of him giving Alex a chance to run
He is found by Maddox and another goon both of whom are wearing red asset bracelets which keep Murphy from shooting either of them
Before Maddox can deliver the fatal shot Lewis shoots him in the back and kills him and then kills the other goon before getting shot himself
Murphy assesses the wound and determines it to be non fatal to Lewis Murphy makes it to the rooftop of the building as Sellars is waiting for a helicopter
Clara and David are there with him as are another mercenary along with Kline and Pope
Alex orders the latter two to stand down and they comply
He attempts to arrest Sellars for trying to have him killed but he is also wearing a red asset bracelet and therefore he cannot shoot him
Sellars aims his gun at Alex and then at Clara and David
This gives Alex enough of a push to override his program and shoot Sellars who returns fire
As Sellars dies Clara and David rush to Alex s side A while later Alex is given a new repaired suit
Clara and David are there to visit him
He smiles as they come in The last scene shows one more segment of The Novak Element
The President has vetoed the repeal of the Dreyfuss Act once Norton testifies against OmniCorp s program
Despite this Novak is still pro robot continuing to praise Sellars and bash Norton for being a whistleblower
As he concludes his show Novak urges viewers to stop whining and to get with the program

The plot follows a secret branch of the United States National Security Agency which has developed a time travelling device based upon alien technology found at Roswell
As the opening of the show says the Chronosphere or Backstep Sphere sends one human being back in time seven days to avert disasters
The show s name refers to the fact that the Backstep Project can only backstep seven days because of limitations imposed by the fuel source and its reactor
As the fuel source is limited there is a strict mandate that they only Backstep for events relating to National Security
The backstep team and the equipment are stationed in a base called Never Never Land which is in a secret location somewhere in the desert of Nevada
Project Backstep Project Backstep was initiated by the National Security Agency after the Roswell incident of 1947
The crashed alien saucer was taken to a secret base called Never Never Land in the Nevada Desert where it was reverse engineered
By reverse engineering the alien technology they were able to create a time machine
The time machine consists of the Chronosphere including the Chronosphere s hangar and its supporting equipment
The time machine uses Element 115 salvaged from the Roswell crash
This transuranic element allowed them to generate a time distortion field around the Chronosphere
The sphere is teleported away from the hangar and into space after which the chrononaut Frank Parker steers the sphere towards the required space and time coordinates

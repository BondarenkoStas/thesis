In the late sixteenth century failed author soldier actor and tax collector Miguel de Cervantes has been thrown into a dungeon by the Spanish Inquisition along with his manservant
They have been charged with foreclosing on a monastery
The two have brought all their possessions with them into the dungeon
There they are attacked by their fellow prisoners who instantly set up a mock trial
If Cervantes is found guilty he will have to hand over all his possessions
Cervantes agrees to do so except for a precious manuscript that the prisoners are all too eager to burn
He asks to be allowed to offer a defense and the defense will be a play acted out by him and all the prisoners
The judge a sympathetic criminal called the Governor agrees
Cervantes takes out a makeup kit from his trunk and the manservant helps him get into a costume
In a few short moments Cervantes has transformed himself into Alonso Quijano an old gentleman who has read so many books of chivalry and thought so much about injustice that he has lost his mind and now believes that he should go forth as a knight errant
Quijano renames himself Don Quixote de La Mancha and sets out to find adventures with his squire Sancho Panza
Don Quixote warns Sancho that the pair are always in danger of being attacked by Quixote s mortal enemy an evil magician known as the Enchanter
Suddenly he spots a windmill
Seeing its sails whirling he mistakes it for a four armed giant attacks it and receives a beating from the encounter
He thinks he knows why he has been defeated It is because he has not been properly dubbed a knight
Looking off he imagines he sees a castle
He orders Sancho to announce their arrival by blowing his bugle and the two proceed to the inn
Cervantes talks some prisoners into assuming the roles of the inn s serving wench and part time prostitute Aldonza and a group of muleteers who are propositioning her
Fending them off sarcastically she eventually deigns to accept their leader Pedro who pays in advance
Don Quixote enters with Sancho upset at not having been announced by a dwarf
The Innkeeper treats them sympathetically and humors Don Quixote but when Quixote catches sight of Aldonza he believes her to be the lady Dulcinea to whom he has sworn eternal loyalty
Aldonza used to being roughly handled is flabbergasted then annoyed at Quixote s strange and kind treatment of her and is further aggravated when the Muleteers turn Quixote s tender ballad into a mocking serenade
Meanwhile Antonia Don Quixote s niece has gone with Quixote s housekeeper to seek advice from the local priest who realizes that the two women are more concerned with the embarrassment the knight s madness may bring than with his welfare
The mock trial s prosecutor a cynic called The Duke is chosen by Cervantes to play Dr Sanson Carrasco Antonia s fiancé a man just as cynical and self centered as the prisoner who is playing him
Carrasco is upset at the idea of having a madman in his prospective new family but the padre cleverly convinces him that it would be a challenge worthy of his abilities to cure his prospective uncle in law so he and the priest set out to bring Don Quixote back home
Back at the inn Sancho delivers a missive from Don Quixote to Aldonza courting her favor and asking for a token
Instead Aldonza tosses an old dishrag at Sancho but to Don Quixote the dishrag is a silken scarf
When Aldonza asks Sancho why he follows Quixote he can come up with no explanation other than I Really Like Him
Alone Aldonza ponders the Knight s behavior and her inability to laugh at him In the courtyard the muleteers once again taunt her with a suggestive song
Pedro makes arrangements with Aldonza for an assignation later
The priest and Dr Carrasco arrive but cannot reason with Don Quixote who suddenly spots a barber wearing his shaving basin on his head to ward off the sun s heat
Quixote immediately snatches the basin from the barber at sword s point believing it to be the miraculous Golden Helmet of Mambrino which will make him invulnerable
Dr Carrasco and the priest leave with the priest impressed by Don Quixote s view of life and wondering if curing him is really worthwhile
Meanwhile Quixote asks the Innkeeper to dub him knight
The innkeeper agrees but first Quixote must stand vigil all night over his armor
Quixote asks to be guided to the chapel for his vigil and the Innkeeper hastily concocts an excuse the chapel is being repaired
Quixote decides to keep his vigil in the courtyard
As he does so Aldonza on her way to her rendezvous with Pedro finally confronts him but Quixote gently explains why he behaves the way he does
Pedro enters furious at being kept waiting and slaps Aldonza
Enraged Don Quixote takes him and all the other muleteers on in a huge fight
Don Quixote has no martial skill but by luck and determination and with the help of Aldonza and Sancho he prevails and the muleteers are all knocked unconscious
But the noise has awakened the Innkeeper who enters and kindly tells Quixote that he must leave
Quixote apologizes for the trouble but reminds the Innkeeper of his promise to dub him knight
The Innkeeper does so
Quixote then announces he must try to help the muleteers
Aldonza whom Quixote still calls Dulcinea is shocked but after the knight explains that the laws of chivalry demand that he succor a fallen enemy Aldonza agrees to help them
For her efforts she is beaten raped and carried off by the muleteers who leave the inn
Quixote in his small room is blissfully ruminating over his recent victory and the new title that the innkeeper has given him and completely unaware of what has just happened to Aldonza
At this point the Don Quixote play is brutally interrupted when the Inquisition enters the dungeon and drags off an unwilling prisoner to be tried
The Duke taunts Cervantes for his look of fear and accuses him of not facing reality
This prompts a passionate defense of idealism by Cervantes
The Don Quixote play resumes
Quixote and Sancho have left the inn and encounter a band of Gypsies who take advantage of Quixote s naiveté and proceed to steal everything they own including Quixote s horse Rocinante and Sancho s donkey Dapple
The two are forced to return to the inn
The Innkeeper tries to keep them out but finally cannot resist letting them back in out of pity
Aldonza shows up with several bruises
Quixote swears to avenge her but she angrily tells him off begging him to leave her alone and flinging her real pitiful history in his face and blaming him for allowing her a glimpse of a life she can never have
She begs him to see her as she really is but Quixote can only see her as his Dulcinea
Suddenly another knight enters
He announces himself as Don Quixote s mortal enemy the Enchanter this time appearing as the Knight of the Mirrors
He insults Aldonza and is promptly challenged to combat by Don Quixote
The Knight of the Mirrors and his attendants bear huge shields with mirrors on them and as they swing them at Quixote the glare from the sunlight blinds him
The attacking Knight taunts him forcing him to see himself as the world sees him as a fool and a madman
Don Quixote collapses weeping
The Knight of the Mirrors removes his own helmet he is really Dr Carrasco returned with his latest plan to cure Quixote
Cervantes announces that the story is finished at least as far as he has written it but the prisoners are dissatisfied with the ending
They prepare to burn his manuscript when he asks for the chance to present one last scene
The Governor agrees and we are now in Alonso Quijano s bedroom where he has fallen into a coma
Antonia Sancho the Housekeeper the priest and Carrasco are all there
Sancho tries to cheer up Quijano
Alonso Quijano eventually awakens and when questioned reveals that he is now sane remembering his knightly career as only a vague dream
He realizes that he is now dying and asks the priest to help him make out his will
As Quijano begins to dictate Aldonza forces her way in
She has come to visit Quixote because she has found that she can no longer bear to be anyone but Dulcinea
When he does not recognize her she sings a reprise of Dulcinea to him and tries to help him remember the words of The Impossible Dream
Suddenly he remembers everything and rises from his bed calling for his armor and sword so that he may set out again
But it is too late in mid song he suddenly cries out and falls dead
The priest sings The Psalm for the dead
However Aldonza now believes in him so much that to her Don Quixote will always live A man died
He seemed a good man but I did not know him Don Quixote is not dead
Believe Sancho
believe
When Sancho calls her by name she replies My name is Dulcinea
The Inquisition enters to take Cervantes to his trial and the prisoners finding him not guilty return his manuscript
It is his unfinished novel Don Quixote de la Mancha
As Cervantes and his servant mount the staircase to go to their impending trial the prisoners led by the girl who played Dulcinea sing The Impossible Dream in chorus

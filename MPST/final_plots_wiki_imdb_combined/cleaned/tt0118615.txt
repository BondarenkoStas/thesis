While shooting a documentary about a long lost Indian tribe the Shirishamas on the Amazon River director Terri Flores and members of her crew including cameraman Danny Rich production manager Denise Kalberg her boyfriend sound engineer Gary Dixon visionary Warren Westridge anthropologist Professor Steven Cale and boat skipper Mateo come across stranded Paraguayan snake hunter Paul Serone and help him believing he knows how to find the tribe they are searching for
Most of the crew are uncomfortable around Sarone and Cale clashes with him several times in regards to Shirishama lore
Later while trying to free the boat s propeller from a rope Cale is stung in the throat by a wasp inside his scuba regulator leaving him unconscious
With that Sarone takes command of the boat and the crew
They are then forced to help him achieve his true objective hunting down and capturing a record breaking giant anaconda he had been tracking
One night the Anaconda killed a jaguar
Mateo is the first of the crew to be killed by the anaconda which coils around him and then breaks his neck near a boat where a poacher had been killed by shooting himself at the beginning of the film
A photograph in an old newspaper reveals that Mateo Sarone and the unnamed poacher were working together to catch animals including snakes
The others try to find him while Gary sides with Sarone who promises if they help him find the anaconda he will help them get out alive
Later at night the anaconda attacks the boat
When Sarone attempts to capture the snake it crushes Gary killing and eating him leaving Denise devastated
The survivors overcome Sarone and tie him up
The next day the boat becomes stuck at a waterfall requiring Terri Danny and Westridge entering the water to winch it loose
When Denise attempts to kill Sarone as revenge for Gary s death he gets the edge and strangles her to death with his legs before dumping her body in the river
When the anaconda returns Westridge distracts it long enough for Terri and Danny to return to the boat while he ascends the waterfall
Danny and the freed Sarone fight as Westridge is coiled by the snake
Before it can kill him the tree supporting the anaconda breaks sending everyone into the water and waking up Cale
With Westridge killed in the fall the snake coils itself around Danny only to be shot in the head by Terri
An enraged Sarone attacks Terri only to be stabbed with the tranquilizer dart by Cale who soon loses consciousness again
Danny punches the drugged Sarone knocking him into the river
However Terri and Danny are soon re captured when Sarone catches up to them
He dumps a bucket of monkey blood on them and uses them as bait in an attempt to capture a second larger anaconda
The anaconda appears and coils around Terri and Danny and begins to suffocate them
They are caught in a net by Sarone but the snake breaks free
Sarone tries to escape but the anaconda finally manages to coil around him and suffocate him
Terri and Danny cut their bonds and watch in horror as the anaconda slowly swallows Sarone whole
Terri finds a nest of baby anacondas in a building but the snake arrives and after regurgitating the still twitching Sarone chases her up a smoke stack
Danny traps the anaconda by pinning its tail to the ground with a pickaxe
Danny ignites a fire below the smoke shack and burns the snake alive
The burning anaconda is sent flying out of the building and plunges into the water where it sinks
As Terri and Danny recuperate on a nearby dock the anaconda appears one final time before Danny slams a splitting maul into the snake s head killing it
Afterwards Terri and Danny reunite with Cale who begins to revive on the boat
As they float down the river they accidentally locate the natives for whom they were originally searching
They realize Sarone was right and begin filming their documentary as the film ends

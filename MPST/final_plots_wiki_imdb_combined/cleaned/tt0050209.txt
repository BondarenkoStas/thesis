The cartoon starts with a baseball going through a window breaking it and Ralph exclaiming Ohhh nooo
His mother sends him up to his bedroom until his father gets home
Up in his room he broods over his mistake and tries to imagine himself as a hero first by imagining himself as a famous explorer in Africa to rescue his parents from a native tribe then tells his father to go to his room for playing in Africa and tells his mother his insurance will cover the window and to buy a catchers mitt with the rest
He is then seen making paper airplanes and wishing he was a jet ace or something
He then is imagining himself as an Air Force pilot who thwarts a Martian invasion and is a national hero
His third dream occurs after he hears his dad come home and can hear the distant talking of both of his parents
His imagines himself as a convict in a jail cell
A whispering voice repeats They re coming to get cha Phillips
He steps down crushes out a cigarette he was apparently smoking and faces the door like a man
The cell door opens and a silhouetted person with a booming voice says You re gonna have to pay for this Ralph Phillips
Back to reality it turns out to be his rather gentle demeaning father who informs Ralph that the window repair was coming out of his allowance then lets him go outside to play
As he runs back outside with a baseball bat and glove he stops when he sees a cherry tree in the yard then notices a hatchet
Next scene he is walking towards the tree with the hatchet and he turns into a young George Washington as the cartoon irises out

At St Mary s College a boarding school for girls located just outside Boston Massachusetts a lonely gaunt unattractive student named Kathy becomes the center of a cruel practical joke perpetrated by a gang of students and the hunky but sadistic gym teacher Fred Vernon
Kathy is tricked into going on a date with Mr Vernon but when she over eagerly makes her move onto him in his parked car in the woods the students appear in their cars to taunt her
Running away from several carloads of her tormentors Kathy runs onto a busy street where she immediately gets hit by an oncoming car and is admitted to the local hospital in a coma
Kathy s strange mother Mary continues to gloom around the school in her capacity as a cleaner
Some time later a new girl named Eva Gordon arrives at the school where she is shown around by the stern headmistress Miss Jones and given Kathy s old room
Eva becomes acquainted with several of the perpetrators of the stunt
It is soon revealed that Eva is Kathy
Eva has somehow been possessed by the spirit of the comatose Kathy who begins using supernatural powers of telekinesis and magic to exact revenge against all those involved in the prank that put her in a coma
The first victim is Mr Vernon whom asks Eva on a date
That night while waiting for Eva to show up at the gym for their secret rendezvous the narcissist Mr Vernon is attacked and strangled by his own reflection when it jumps out of a mirror
The following morning the police detective on the scene concludes that Mr Vernon died of a heart attack
The following night Virginia Williams one of the students involved in the prank against Kathy is attacked in her bed and suffocated to death by an onslaught of snails that appear and then disappear
Again the police do not have any explanation for the mysterious death
Meanwhile the neurologist in charge of Kathy s case Dr Robert Anderson notices that Kathy s vital signs increase in step with each of the mysterious deaths at the school
But he cannot make a connection to it
The next morning Dr Anderson is called to the school to examine Eva when she has a violent breathing fit during a class
During that same time Kathy s respirator temporally breaks down which leads to Eva s respirtory attack but nobody makes any connection to it
Afterwards the strange Eva comes on strong to Dr Anderson leading him to ask her on a date where afterwards she seduces him
During a field trip to a local art gallery Grace another one of Kathy s tormenters returns to the gallery when it closes to search for a valuable piece of jewelry that she left behind on the day visit
A marble statue comes to life and falls down on her crushing her to death
Dr Anderson starts to become more apprehensive about the intense Eva
One evening he suffers a horrible nightmare where she kills him after sex
He s relieved when Eva s mother arrives at the school to take her home for some rest
Eva begins to write obsessive love notes to him but he brushes them off
Soon Anderson becomes involved with another girl named Jenny Clark the only student who shows any remorse for the prank gone wrong against Kathy
Eva runs away from home and returns to the school after dark
Eva sets her eyes on Kim one of Kathy s cruelest tormenters
As Kim is preparing to meet her boyfriend Tim for a date Eva makes Kim see horrific visions of Tim being decapitated at every turn
Kim suffers an anxiety attack and in attempting to flee from the gory visions plummets out of a third floor window to her death
Tim arrives seconds later looks out an open window and sees Kim lying dead on the pavement below
Tim is decapitated when Eva commands the window blind to fall down on his neck
Eva quietly leaves the building while Kathy s mother Mary watches from a distance
At the hospital Jenny arrives for a late night date with Dr Anderson when she gets lost in the gloomily lit building thanks to Eva using Kathy s magic skills of mind bending
Jenny ends up in the morgue where she encounters Eva
The possessed girl grabs a scalpel and threatens to kill Jenny for taking away her man but Anderson arrives in time to intercept the slash of the scalpel but gets badly slashed on his forearm
As Eva rises the scalpel to stab them both she suddenly freezes gasps for a few seconds and falls to the floor dead
Upstairs in Kathy s hospital room her mother has pulled out all her intravenous drips removed the respirator and turned off the life support systems
Appalled at the supernatural malice of her comatose daughter Mary has somehow figured out of Kathy s connection to Eva and has decided to put her daughter to rest
Kathy s soul rises out of her body as a bright blue light floats out a nearby window and disappears into the night sky

Gabe Mujari and Lian are mourning Teresa Lipan in Whispering Woods
Hadden is then seen talking to Aramov who complains that with administration pulls he could end it
Hadden responds by saying he has other plans for Gabe Logan that hearings have been scheduled and that he has to blame a party At the Senate house in Washington D C Mujari and Lian are standing outside in a hallway while Gabe is inside talking to Hadden
Hadden tells Gabe his own version of the Syphon Filter Virus situation saying that There is no conspiracy no arms consortium only a traitor
Acting alone or with his friends
He then asks Gabe if he has ever assassinated a world leader
Gabe says no but remembers a mission in Tokyo in which he shot Shi Hao from across the street in a hotel In the first flashback Gabe is dropped off at a hotel where Lian tells him that he has to go to room 413
Gabe goes up to the desk and asks for the key
He then goes to the elevator
After a talk with the elevator attendant about the weather Gabe goes to the room
He receives a transmission from Lian to get his equipment from the bathtub Gabe gets his equipment and goes to the window
He draws a bead on Shi Hao who is currently in a meeting interrogation with the JRA
Gabe watches as they are beating a man
He takes the shot only after eliminating the rooftop sniper and kills Shi Hao
Shi Hao s highest ranking lieutenants and other men in the building rush to attack Gabe but he takes them out easily JRA members have entered the hotel and have captured the daughter of a Japanese official hostage
Gabe eliminates most if not all of the grunts and in the process gets an explosive round shotgun from the man who took the beating across the street
He rescues the daughter of the Japanese official
Gabe leaves the hotel and Lian tells him that hearings have been scheduled The second mission is also a flashback
In it Gabe details the events leading up to the D C incident in 1999
Gabe and Lian were sent to Central America in Costa Rica to meet with Ellis who was undercover infiltrating the ranks of Rhoemer s terrorist group Gabe and Lian were airdropped into the area but were separated with two soldiers in between them
After they meet up they notice multiple automated turret emplacements
Gabe and Lian are only able to take out the guns with grenades and at the second emplacement Lian runs out forcing Gabe to destroy the rest on his own Rhoemer has Anton Girdeaux set fire to all the plants in the area and has Aramov kill Ellis
Gabe and Lian show up right after Ellis was killed
Gabe and Lian are told by Edward Benton to continue Ellis mission
Gabe must secure 3 samples of the plants and destroy Rhoemer s assault chopper Lian must find out what they were growing Gabe gets his samples takes out the chopper rescues two slaves and finally comes across a minefield
While he was collecting the samples Lian tells him that Rhoemer was heading for a landing strip
Gabe crosses the minefield guarding said airstrip
Benton then calls and tells Gabe to meet up with Lian
He ignores the order and heads for Rhoemer
Gabe procures a jeep and trails Rhoemer to his C 5 Galaxy transport
The former manages to get on and find the exact same type of armor he would later find used by Jason Chance
Gabe finds Rhoemer donning the armor and shoots him with a USAS 12 to knock him out of the open cargo bay door
However Rhoemer had a parachute on and is able to escape The next testimony for Hadden to hear spans two missions and it is Mujari who gives the account
Mujari explains the first time he came into contact with the Agency and the Syphon Filter virus
In 1984 Mujari was working with the ANC in South Africa to free repressed Africans
Mujari freed two slaves saved his partner Dejesus destroyed the mines with explosives spoke with Foreman Jones about the sick workers and sent the transmission to HQ which was normally Venik Smith s mission he was killed by two soldiers when Mujari reached the Transmitter Tower
When a movie that shows him going down the elevator and looking at the sick workers he tells Hadden in his testimony that he has found his brothers but he would not be setting them free
We find that after the testimony that Mujari kept the South African samples and Teresa Lipan who was working in the WHO came to his lab and saw the South African sample
Hadden says that Mujari gave the virus to Teresa but Mujari said that he thought nothing of it and that Teresa asked him to work on the virus in a lab
Hadden asked if he remembered which lab Teresa took Mujari to
Mujari replied Of course
It was Pharcom
When it was Lian s turn to testify she tells about the events that happened in Kabul Afghanistan during 1987
At the time of the event she was gathering evidence of Soviet troop movements led by Uri Gregorov while she was an MSS agent
She was ambushed at one point by the Soviets and was saved by a U S Army Ranger
The Ranger that saved her was none other than Gabe Logan
Gabe debriefed Lian on his mission to deliver weapons to the local rebels in the area and Lian agreed to create a distraction for him While Lian was testifying Gabe was doing a joint operation with an MI 6 team headed by Margeret Powers
They tracked a shipment of the Syphon Filter Virus in Dublin Ireland and had objectives to destroy the ship in order to prevent the virus from falling to the wrong hands
He planted three explosives in three different cargo holds and one decoy explosive in the engine room
Gabe also recovers the shipping manifest to find out where the virus came from Lian then started telling about her side of the operation in Costa Rica saying that Rhoemer had kidnapped an impressive list of world renowned scientists and medical technicals to work at his labs
Benton ordered Lian to get the scientists out alive in order to find out whatever the plants were used for
She was also ordered to collect the physical sample of the virus collect data disks and destroy the seven computers that were inside
During the mission we discover that Elsa Weissinger was one of Rhoemer s lab technicians
She was ordered by Rhoemer s men to tell where her mentor Dr Fried was so her life would be spared
It s discovered that the plants were part of creating the Syphon Filter virus At the time of testifying about the Costa Rica operation Gabe and the MI 6 team were under attack by the Irish Republic Army
The IRA discovered the Agency consortium s plans to drop off viral containers at this particular dockyard and already unloaded several truckloads of the virus while the bombs were planted on the ship
Gabe and the MI 6 team set out to prevent the trucks from the leaving the area and find out who leaked the shipment to the IRA in the first place
After containing and destroying all but 1 truck an MI 6 agent named Nigel Cummings was revealed to be pinned down with the final truck
After getting to Nigel and the truck Nigel attempted to drive off with it almost running over Gabe in the process and in turn revealing Nigel as the double agent of the IRA so Gabe ran after and killed Nigel before he escaped with the last truck It was Gabe s turn to testify and he told about his mission to deliver the weapons to the rebels in Afghanistan during 1987
Gabe Ellis and Benton were the only survivors of a destroyed convoy
While Benton was driving the truck Gabe and Ellis were repelling attacks from other Afghan rebel factions while clearing away all obstacles
Upon entering Kabul Lian s diversion worked as the heavily guarded portion of their entrance was temporarily empty
Unfortunately the rendezvous point had a Soviet T 64 tank guarding the town square
Gabe had to take out the tank using C 4 charges
Gabe then reveals to Hadden that Benton s contact was not an Afghan rebel but a Soviet agent
It turned out that Benton did not work for the CIA
He worked for the Agency which was supplying weapons to the Soviets
However Benton shot the Soviet agent dead before ordering Ellis and Gabe to leave the weapons for the rebels
He recruited Gabe and Ellis into the Agency several years later While Gabe was testifying Lian was working in the Tanami desert at Australia with tactical support provided by Maggie
The manifest recovered by Gabe led her to the desert and also found out that Dr Elsa Weissenger was running the medical end of the operation
Lian intends to capture Elsa take photographic evidence of genocide sabotage the compound s communications systems take out as many terrorists as possible and save the local aborigines from being used as test subjects
Upon finding Elsa Lian forces her to synthesise the vaccine after getting three compounds to make it
Before going off to save the villagers Elsa gives Lian a data disk containing information about Mara Aramov and the agency she had made as an insurance policy in case Aramov double crossed her
Lian saves the villagers and kills Commander Silvers in the process although when Lian returns to the chopper Elsa is missing Hadden starts to accuse Gabe of lying in his deposition and is about to have him arrested as a traitor and for killing many people but Teresa herself barges in arguing that Gabe is innocent because she faked her death
Hadden was shocked at her appearance
Teresa makes a testimony of what happened when she was an ATF agent in Western Montana Paradise Ridge
She was sent in to find missing ATF agents investigating a satellite falling from orbit when she ended up helping two FBI agents saying that they needed back up in order to take down a militia sniper
Teresa provided back up for the agents but she ended up being in a middle of a conspiracy It turned out that a militia survivalist named Earl Oakton was captured by the Agents and was executed in cold blood
The acclaimed FBI agents were corrupt NSA agents who were hell bent on killing the Oakton family to cover up the illegal data they had taken from the satellite
One NSA agent captured Teresa after she watched Earl Oakton get executed
Teresa s captor killed the executors and it was revealed that Gabe Logan was the one responsible for saving her life
Gabe is concerned about retrieving the data
Teresa does her best to save the militia men and her fellow ATF agents from the NSA hitmen
She eventually meets up with the Oakton family recovers the satellite data and extracts them from the area with Gabe At the end of the testimony it turned out that Teresa was shadowing Hadden the entire time and found out that he has been talking to Mara Aramov
Gabe appears with federal agents with a warrant to arrest Hadden
Before any action could be taken Aramov interrupts and shoots all in sight but Gabe and Teresa escape danger
While Teresa monitors the wounded agents Gabe attempts to pursue Aramov while saving captured federal agents and finding the code to disarm the bombs she had planted around the senate building
After sending the codes to Mujari Gabe continues his pursuit eventually entering a subway train and shooting Aramov Upon Aramov s capture Gabe is now given the head position of the Agency which was eventually labelled the IPCA
Before any protagonist could have a break Mara Aramov escaped the hospital
Gabe however was more concerned about forming the IPCA and decided to settle this unfinished business with Mara at a later time
The ending clip shows Mara in a mini sub recovering some of the shipment of the Syphon Filter virus from the S S Lorelei s wreckage

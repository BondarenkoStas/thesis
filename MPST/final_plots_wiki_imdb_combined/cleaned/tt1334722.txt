Aboard the ship Advenna Avis in 1711 a group of alchemists summon a demon in the hopes of gaining eternal life
The demon gives them an elixir of immortality and the method of ending their existence by devouring one another and grants the summoner Maiza Avaro the formula of the elixir
Maiza and most of the alchemists decide that no one else must become immortal only Szilard Quates opposes
That night the alchemists begin to disappear devoured by Szilard
Realizing the threat posed by staying together they scatter across the globe
In New York City during November 1930 Szilard succeeds in recreating the elixir only to have it stolen by young thug Dallas Genoard
The elixir continually moves around the city because of Dallas with the three mafiosi Gandor brothers the two idiotic thieves Isaac Dian and Miria Harvent and Maiza s protege Firo Prochainezo and their Camorra family the Martillo all passing it around

However all other parties accidentally consume the elixir mistaking it for alcohol at a party for Firo

The Snorks are a race of small colorful beings that live happily in the undersea world of Snorkland
They have snorkels on their heads which are used to propel them swiftly through the water
As evidenced by the cartoon series when a Snork becomes excited their tube makes a snork sound
They have much of the same technology as contemporary humans adapted to their own aquatic environment
The Snorks use clams as currency
According to the Snork back story which was described in the show s first opening theme a few ventured to the surface in 1643 and watched a Royal Navyship of the Spanish Armada being attacked by pirates
The captain wound up in the water and that was the first contact between the species when the Snorks saved his life to which the captain then expressed his gratitude by writing down the encounter in his logbook although very few humans believe in the existence of the Snorks
Since then Snorks have adopted several human habits such as wearing clothes
There are a few episodes which have human encounters with the Snorks
In the episode Allstar s Freshwater Adventure the Snorks meet freshwater snorks
Freshwater snorks have two snorkels on their head and a distinctive biochemistry from saltwater snorks

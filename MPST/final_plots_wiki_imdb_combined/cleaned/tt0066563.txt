His mother an 87 year old widow is ruining Gordon Hocheiser s love life
He resents her so much Gordon tries to scare her to death by donning a gorilla suit and attacking her in bed only to end up on the receiving end of her cane
An attempt is made to persuade Sidney his brother to take their mother off Gordon s hands
Sidney has troubles of his own though repeatedly getting mugged in Central Park
Gordon a lawyer made a deathbed promise to his father not to place his mother in a rest home
She continues to keep asking where Poppa is
Gordon locates a nurse Louise whose patients have a peculiar habit of dying in her care
He hires Louise to be his mother s companion hoping for the worst and falls in love with Louise in the process
Sidney borrows the gorilla costume and wears it home
Rather than scaring off muggers they force him to attack a woman in the park who turns out to be an undercover police officer
At the end of his rope with Louise unable to stand the mother one minute more and threatening to leave Gordon he drives to a rest home and drops off his mother at the entrance telling her Poppa is there
Then he drives away

However instead of allowing him back in Mr Griffin decides to make him repeat the class next semester
Fellow students in the class include David Ruggles Jeff Garrett Betsy Cline and Susan McConnell
Mark suggests kidnapping Mr Griffin and convinces David Jeff and Betsy to join in on the plan as a way of scaring him and getting revenge because they feel he has treated them poorly
The group decides to use Susan who is least willing to participate in the plot to distract Mr Griffin by requesting a conference with him after school
Since Susan is one of his better performing students with a serious approach to her studies Mr Griffin willingly does so allowing her to walk him to his car afterwards
Jeff David and Mark forcefully place a bag over Mr Griffin s head and tie him up replacing the bag with a blindfold as they take him to a remote spot in the mountains
Betsy thanks to a speeding ticket arrives in the parking lot after the boys have left with Mr Griffin
Susan was supposed to ride with Betsy but does not want any further part in the scheme and Betsy leaves without her
Mark tells Mr Griffin to beg but he refuses so the students decide to leave him alone there until midnight
Susan and David defy the group and go check on Mr Griffin
The two find him dead as a result of coronary arrest after being unable to take his medication for angina
Mark convinces the rest of the group to cover up the death
He instructs Susan who was the last one known to the police to see Mr Griffin to tell them Mr Griffin kept looking at his watch during the conference and left with a pretty woman
Jeff Mark and David bury the body in the mountains
Betsy and David also drive Mr Griffin s car to the airport but the officer who gave Betsy a ticket sees her there
Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr Griffin s Jeff and Betsy move the car into Jeff s garage so he can repaint it before they hide it elsewhere
Mark s ex girlfriend Lana Turnboldt has a picnic with her fianc√© at the secluded place in the mountains where they discover Mr Griffin s medicine bottle
The police investigate and find Mr Griffin s body buried nearby
However police do not find the ring Mr Griffin was wearing when he died as David had taken it
Irma Ruggles David s paternal grandmother who lives with him discovers the ring and refuses to give it back to him believing the ring to be that of David s father who had left him
David tells Susan he took the ring and his grandmother found it but they are unsuccessful at retrieving it from her so Susan tells Mark about the situation because she feels he would know what to do
Irma Ruggles is later murdered and a neighbor refers to the suspect as a boy in a brown sweater
Susan makes the connection knowing that Mark has a brown sweater he wears all the time and that Mark would stop at nothing to get what he needed in this case the ring
Susan plans to tell the police all that the group has done
Before she can inform the police Mark Jeff and Betsy tie Susan up and Jeff and Betsy leave to hide Mr Griffin s car

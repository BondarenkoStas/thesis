The series centers on Scott in the role of Neil Brock a New York City social worker who worked for the private agency Community Welfare Service with his secretary Jane Foster played by actress Cicely Tyson
Episodes of East Side West Side covered topics relevant to the inner city with many controversial issues explored
A typical example came in the first two episodes when Brock investigated a prostitute and her child followed by a story involving statutory rape
In an effort to open up the number of possible stories Brock resigned from his job in the latter portion of the 1963 64 season to work for a New York congressman Charles W Hanson
The characters played by Elizabeth Wilson and Cicely Tyson soon disappeared and Barbara Feldon is introduced as Brock s girlfriend
However despite the high quality of both the writing and acting the show s penchant for taking on touchy topics forced many potential advertisers to avoid sponsorship of the show while a number of local stations across the country also chose not to present the program to their viewers
It is said that CBS programming head James Aubrey clashed with Scott regarding the direction of the show which also was a factor in the cancellation
The December 23 1963 episode Creeps Live Here was originally scheduled to be broadcast on November 25 but was postponed as CBS wrapped up their four day coverage of the John F Kennedy assassination
East Side West Side ran in the 10 p m Monday time slot opposite ABC s medical drama about psychiatry Breaking Point and NBC s Sing Along with Mitch starring Mitch Miller
The show s executive producer David Susskind began a letter writing campaign to government officials newspaper editors and other prominent individuals
Susskind s request was an attempt to elicit positive feedback to encourage renewal of the series
However the effort failed when the show was cancelled on January 28

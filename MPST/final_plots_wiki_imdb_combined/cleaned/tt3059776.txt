Vince s story Day 2Vince aims at an unknown character and shoots him
He then runs away and has an option to either toss the gun up on the roof throw it in the trash drop it down the drain or keep hold of it
Either way the gun is found and Vince is arrested The next scene will show Vince on the prison bus stuck in traffic
Vince begins to converse with two fellow prisoners Justin and Danny who each tell one another how they got arrested and their lives outside of jail
Meanwhile near the front of the bus two prisoners get into an argument that caused Marcus Crabtree to strangle Jerry with his handcuffs
Clyde a bumbling prison guard attempts to break up the fight at gunpoint resulting in him shooting Marcus in the head
As the prisoners and guards are stunned in shock they witness zombies overwhelming drivers on the neighboring road
At that moment Jerry reanimates and kills Clyde as the bus driver flees the bus and abandons the prisoners After managing to acquire Clyde s shotgun and killing Jerry the prisoners try to discover a way to escape
As walkers drawn by the gunfire attempt to enter the bus Vince and his fellow inmates attempt to escape
As they re all connected by a chain running through their shackles they are all confined to their seats and cannot leave
After attempting to break the barred windows and the chain itself Danny theorizes that if Vince could shoot just one of their shackles off the other two prisoners could escape
At this point Vince needs to choose whether to shoot off Danny s foot or Justin s foot
Who ever Vince shoots has their shackle come loose allowing Vince and the other prisoner to escape the bus as the shot prisoner writhes in pain on the bus floor Wyatt s story Day 41The story has Wyatt and Eddie driving away from Nate after what is hinted that their camp was raided by a group causing Eddie to kill a man and having them escape with Nate following them
After Wyatt or Eddie shoots at Nate destroying a headlight he pulls off the side of the road giving Wyatt and Eddie the opportunity to pull off into the woods in hopes of evading Nate
After some conversation between the two Eddie runs over Bennett causing Wyatt and Eddie to have an argument about who goes and investigates whether or not it was a walker with you either convincing Eddie to go or playing a game of rock paper scissors to decide If Eddie goes Nate finds Wyatt in the car and causes Wyatt to abandon Eddie or Wyatt goes and after finding Bennett you are given the option of either carrying Bennett back to the car after walkers start coming or leaving him
Whichever option you choose Eddie abandons Wyatt after being attacked by Nate ending the scenario with him running off into the forest Russell s story Day 184When he is walking down a road a truck is seen coming towards him
Russell has the option to either jump into the grass area off the road or stand his ground
Hiding will place him right next to Carley Doug s rotting corpse
Either way Nate will see Russell and ask him to join him After getting in the truck and some dialogue Nate offers Russell a drink which the player can refuse or accept
Later Russell refuses to comply with the man s questioning about a woman in his former group after which Nate allows a female walker to nearly bite him until the latter gives a rating of the attractiveness she might ve been before becoming a zombie
Amused by Russell s frantic answer Nate pulls out his pistol to shoot the walker but realizes he forgot to reload the gun
He tells Russell to load the gun and speeds off in the truck to get away from the walker Their next stop is the truck stop where Nate suggests they grab supplies when he gets interrupted by bullets shot at his car
Russell gets out of the truck and ducks down to a gas pump as Nate yells that he ll cover him and make a run back for the truck
As Russell s running to the pickup he ll notice that Nate isn t shooting
Nate tells Russell to peak his head over the bed of the truck to see where the sniper is shooting from
After discovering the location of the sniper Nate will suggest moving to the red car across the station
Russell will now have the choice to go first or cover Nate
After Russell and Nate get to the second car Russell will have to run the the semi with Nate covering him
As he is running Russell trips and falls but then Nate comes to the rescue picking up Russell and saving his life When you get to the back you may see a walker that is the cop that was bitten from Vince s story and Russell has the choice to kill it or walk away
Walking away will allow the walker to show up in Bonnie s story when she rolls down the hill When inside the cafe Russell will have the choice to sneak up on the shooter or run up on him
Either way he finds out that the shooter is just an old man trying to protect his injured wife
The man thought that Nate was the man who hurt his wife and that he brought his friend to finish the job and take all of his food
Nate then brings up that he should just kill them and take their food for shooting at them for no reason
Russell then has the choice to stay with Nate or walk away
Either way Nate will shoot the couple thus revealing where the bloodstain from Shel s story in the cafe originated from Bonnie s story Day 220Bonnie s story starts off with her talking to Leland about having a snake tongue or lobster claws for hands
You ll be able to choose which Bonnie can say
Leland will then mention that Bonnie has come a long way from when he and Dee found her while she was on drugs and how they helped her to deal with it
Bonnie can thank Leland for everything or avoid the subject
Either way Leland will caress her face before Dee shows up
Dee immediately questions them on what it is they re talking about
Bonnie can tell the truth or lie
Dee will show Bonnie and Leland a bag that she had found
Bonnie and Leland question her on where she got the bag or if she stole it
Bonnie later asks Dee if she could borrow her red nail polish once they got back to camp commenting that she liked it As the conversation gets heated about the bag Dee begins to accuse Leland of always taking Bonnie s side and calling her his girlfriend
Bonnie can tell Dee or Leland to stop or can tell both she s leaving
Leland will stop Bonnie from leaving calling her darling which angers Dee
Dee then tells Bonnie and Leland to run
Bonnie turns around to see lights coming their way
Bonnie starts to run but is shot in the shoulder
Leland tries to turn back to help her but Dee drags him away
Bonnie gets up and tries to run after them sliding down a hill onto the road with the prison bus Vince was in
Bonnie awakens to the sight of a zombified Clyde and kills him or if Clyde was killed Bonnie will not be attacked
Bonnie gets up and runs into the cornfield calling for Leland and Dee with the group who shot her right behind her
Bonnie runs through the cornfield avoiding them before running behind a tractor for safety Bonnie grabs a rebar from the ground and hits one of the people approaching her only to discover it was Dee
Bonnie in a state of panic tries to apologize to Dee saying it was an accident
The conversation varies depending on what you choose for Bonnie you could assure Dee that she wasn t trying to steal Leland away from her or tell her that she is interested in Leland and wanted him for herself
Dee will then die calling her a junkie
When Leland arrives he sees that Bonnie is shot and asks her if she s alright
Leland breaks down after seeing Dee dead
Bonnie can tell him the truth of what happened or lie to him that she found Dee that way
Depending on the conversation Leland can believe her or not
This will decide if Leland goes with Bonnie or stays with Dee
When Leland follows Bonnie he takes the bag that Dee stole saying that she didn t die for nothing
If Leland did stay behind a shot can be heard while Bonnie runs away Shel s story Day 236 259Shel s story begins with her and other members of her group listening to Shel s younger sister Becca playing the guitar
After she finishes Becca asks if they could make this a weekly thing and you can choose to encourage her or tell her that it s not a great idea
Either way Roman another leader of the group will chime in saying music will always be welcome mentioning cheerily how he used to be part of a band
Then the group will return to their assigned survival duties and Becca offers to check the ammo while Shel and Stephanie check food and other supplies Once again your choice to allow her to check the ammo or not will encourage or discourage her
Shel then proceeds to check the supplies and appliances around the gas station and walks out back
When she does she s surprised by the group s watch dogs or chained up walkers which they used to guard their supplies from other people who might try to steal them
She s disgusted to see an old woman walker eating the entrails of a small puppy and then walks back inside
Just as she does Becca growls like a walker and jumps out at her and she gets mad
Becca tells her she never used to get angry when she would fool around and asks Shel what s wrong
Shel can respond angrily or remorsefully and her choice will affect Becca
Stephanie then barges in through the front telling her something happened outside
Shel and Becca head outside to see the group surrounding a man on his knees with his hands tied and blindfolded Roman mentions that the man cannot speak English and that he was caught trying to take food and medicine from the group
After some discussion the group decides the man cannot stay as he would only drain their resources and that they must either let him go or kill him
Stephanie and Boyd vote to release him and Clive and Joyce vote to kill him leaving the swing vote to Shel
At this point the player must choose to vote to kill the stranger or release him
If Shel votes to release him Stephanie and Boyd praise her while Clive and Joyce chastise her and if Shel votes to kill him the reverse occurs
If the man is released Roman warns the man that if he ever returns he ll wish he was killed
If you vote to kill the man Roman shoots him in the back of the head as Shel and Becca watch Three weeks later Shel and Becca are playing cards talking about the decision that was made
Becca mentions Boyd s death and how she misses being able to play guitar
Roman then comes in and says he needs to talk to Shel
She can leave immediately or head out to talk shortly after
When Shel heads outside she can either discover from Joyce or by talking to Roman directly that Stephanie tried to steal food and ammunition and escape the camp
Shel tells Roman her gun is back in the RV and walks back there
The last decision of the episode quickly arises where Shel can either leave the group in the RV with Becca or take the gun and kill Stephanie
Becca encourages Shel to stay with the group where it s safe but Shel doesnt want them to live like this
If Shel picks the gun she ll walk out of the RV slowly and will walk with Roman to shoot Stephanie
If she picks the keys she wildly pulls out of the diner lot with a very angry Roman behind them Tavia Epilogue Day 400The epilogue begins with Tavia taking the last of the five photographs along with a note left by the five protagonists off the bulletin board at the Pitstop
She contacts someone on the radio saying they were right about there being surviors in the area and she plans to make contact with them tonight at a nearby campsite
The voice on the radio warns to use her best judgement since the community they re building should only contain good people That night Tavia drives up to the campsite
The voice on the radio wishes her luck and tells her not to force anyone into anything they don t want to be a part of
As she approaches the campsite Bonnie is the first to see her and calls for Vince
Vince quickly runs up and holds Tavia at gunpoint asking who she is
She tells them who she is and that she s a scout for a community located north of the camp
Wyatt asks how she managed to find them and Tavia can either say she found the note the smoke or it s just what she does She offers them the oppurtinity to come with her and join the community where they have food water and shelter for everyone
Bonnie immediately believes her exclaiming that it is too good to be true
Becca on the other hand does not believe her and tells Bonnie to get real
Tavia tells them they don t all need to come just people who want to be there
They can even split up if they want to
She then asks them whether or not they want to come with her Russell argues over why anyone should trust her saying that everyone outside their group is crazy
Tavia agrees that there are bad people out there but claims that no one will hurt them saying when they see the place they ll change their minds
She tells them they have every right to be wary and that they have no idea who she is or whether or not to trust her
Depending on what choices the player makes while playing as the other protagonists they will either decide to join Tavia or stay at the campsite After everyone makes up their minds Tavia gives Vince the photographs and the note and asks what they should do with them
They proceed to toss them into the campfire and Bonnie exclaims that this is a good thing
Vince asks Tavia how they ll know it ll work
Tavia gives a reassuring answer that it will

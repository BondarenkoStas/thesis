Maria Vial is a white French farmer who runs a failing coffee plantation in an unnamed African country in the present day
Maria and Andre have a lazy mentally unstable son Manuel while Andre has another half African son Jose
Civil war has broken out and rebel soldiers many of them child soldiers are advancing on the area
The French military while pulling out makes one final plea for Maria to leave but unyielding in her desire to protect her family s home and blinded by her own anti white prejudice she ignores the warnings
Meanwhile a rebel DJ on the radio urges the rebels on and advocates attacks on emblems of colonialism
Maria s workers flee for fear of the upcoming conflict
Maria stubbornly refuses to abandon the plantation and its harvest which will be ready in five days
Risking her life and unable to find Andre she drives to a village to hire men to finish harvesting the coffee
On the way she is forced to pay off bandits who threaten to kill her at a roadblock
After hiring the workers she stops at the elementary school and collects Andre s other son Jose
Jose is an upbeat boy of about 12 and we later learn that his mother is Andre s father s young housekeeper
Meanwhile we see Andre in town meeting with the African mayor Cherif
Cherif seeing that Andre is desperate takes advantage of the situation and offers to purchase the plantation for the cancellation of Andre s debts
Cherif requires Andre to get his father to sign over the coffee plantation to him
Having returned to the plantation Maria searches out her son Manuel and finds him in bed after midday
Trying to rouse him she laments his listlessness and scolds that he is without purpose
Manuel rises and after a swim is intrigued by a noise in the house
He follows it to two young rebels
They run and in spite of his lack of shoes Manuel follows them far from the home
They eventually corner them he discovers that they re armed with a spear and a machete
The rebel boys threaten him cut his hair and retreat to the bush firing shots from a revolver
Maria Andre and some workers converge on Manuel and are shocked to find him stripped and standing naked in the field
The fact that the oldest boy stuck his revolver down Manuel s pants as well as his state of shock the dirt on his hands and knees and his later over reaction indicate he was raped off camera
Maria loads him in the tractor and heads back to the house
Manuel obviously traumatized and out of his mind abandons the tractor and goes to his grandfathers home
There the heavily tattooed Manuel reacts to his assault by shaving his head stealing his grandfathers shotgun attacking Jose s mother and disappearing on his mother s motorbike
Despite Andre s continued pleas that they should flee Maria remains steadfast in her efforts to bring in the coffee crop
She discovers the wounded rebel hero known as The Boxer in a barn and feeds him
As night falls the workers bed down and Maria falls asleep dreaming of an earlier evening where we see her discussing Manuel with Cherif in what appears to be a romantic situation fueled by marijuana
Cherif warns her that her son is half baked a statement which makes her laugh
She awakens and attempts to start work again
However the radio issues reports that the Boxer is being harbored by the foreigners and that loyal citizens should oppose them
Her workers hearing this demand to be paid immediately
Upon threat Maria opens the safe to find that the money is all gone likely taken by Andre to secure passage out of the country
The workers demand to be driven back to the village
Maria agrees and starts driving them back
Before they can reach the village they are stopped by a band of young rebels who appear to be wearing her clothing and jewelry
The rebels demand the truck and when a worker protests that they are just poor villagers the rebels shoot him and drive off leaving Maria by the roadside
Maria discovers they have looted the pharmacy and killed the doctor and his assistant
Driving the truck down the road the rebels are pursued by Manuel who tells them that he knows where the Boxer is and leads them back to the plantation
He is clearly mad as he assists the rebels to loot his own family s food store
The rebels and Manuel gorge themselves on the food and then ingest the many pharmaceutical products which they have stolen
Almost all then pass out in and around the house
Government troops then retake control of the area
We see them slip onto the plantation grounds immediately in front of Andre s father who calls out no warning to anyone inside
We see the troops move from room to room slitting the throats of the rebels who are passed out from the orgy of food and medication
Government troops then lock the gun toting Manuel in one of the farm buildings and burn him to death
Andre is shown dead on the floor of the house holding the family passports
In the town Maria is overwrought she is seeking a way back to the house when Cherif sees her and gives her a ride
At the plantation Maria finds Manuel s charred body
Andre s father is shown walking around the barn where Manuel was burned
Maria hacks Andre s father to death with a machete presumably seeing him at least partly responsible for the death of her son
Another reason may be the fact that Andre s father had promised Maria that she would inherit the plantation but has broken the promise this very day by selling the land to Cherif the mayor
Since Maria s ex husband who was instigator of the sale has already been killed his father is the only one in the family left to be punished
At the end we see one rebel leaving the area with the wounds to his head
He carries the beret of the Boxer
He tucks it into his trousers and continues into the countryside

When the Vikings invade England Alfred is about to take his priesthood vows
However his brother King Æthelred of Wessex summons him to his aid and Alfred leaves for battle where he appears to be a great tactician
Æthelred dies shortly after Alfred marries the Mercian princess Aelhswith
Torn between following intellect or passion Alfred at first refuses to succeed Æthelred and consummate his marriage but is forced to accept kingship after the Danes attack again
Realising the weak position of Wessex Alfred goes into negotiations with Guthrum leader of the Vikings
Aelhswith on the other hand agrees to become Guthrum s hostage and they start to develop feelings for each other
Alfred has difficulty acting like a king calling for obedience and egalitarianism in the Medieval society of three estates which the fighting nobility does not appreciate
The cleric Asser warns him that he is too proud and later the Danes defeat Alfred
The latter is forced to retreat to the fens of Somerset
Roger s bandits who take Alfred in are more loyal to Alfred than his noblemen
The nobles however drop their regicide plans and support Alfred in the climactic Battle of Athelney
Roger sees that Alfred will need help and in the midst of battle he arrives with monks old men and peasant women armed with clubs and pitchforks
Alfred defeats Guthrum knocking him out but decides to spare his life and forgives Aelhswith
